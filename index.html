The little mouse works as hard as the bigger mice to show readiness for the mission . . . and is chosen for the flight! While in space, the astronauts are busy with their mission when disaster strikes&#x2014;and only the smallest member of the crew can save the day. With lively illustrations by award-winning artist C.

Visit him online at CFPayne.com.K-Gr 2-In this picture book based on the space shuttle Endeavor, mice are being trained alongside human astronauts and selected to accompany the 2001 mission. Meteor is one of the smallest mice, but the most hardworking. After the suspenseful liftoff, an irreplaceable key gets stuck between control panels, and he hurls into action to save the mission. The concise, energetic writing works in tandem with the highly detailed and expressive, softly crosshatched cartoon art. The tone of the story is celebratory, but also gives an authentic glimpse into daily life on a space shuttle. Close-ups of characters reveal humorous surprise or just pure glee. The astronauts dub Meteor with the title "Mousetronaut" due to his bravery and service. Librarians will want to share the inspiration for this tale included in the afterword, an informative essay on man's quest to overcome gravity and fly. Apparently, during the duration of the flight, only one of the 18 mice onboard the Endeavor playfully and contentedly floated in zero gravity. The rest clung to the cage. The values of being small, useful, solving problems, and working hard-as opposed to being big and strong-will inspire young readers. The bibliography is outstanding as is the kid-friendly list of Internet sources featuring sites with games and videos.-Sara Lissa Paulson, American Sign Language and English Lower School, New York City&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Dash, in a bad mood during the holidays, happens to be the first guy to pick up the notebook and rise to its challenges. <br><br>What follows is a whirlwind romance as Dash and Lily trade dares, dreams, and desires in the notebook they pass back and forth at locations all across New York City. But can their in-person selves possibly connect as well as their notebook versions, or will their scavenger hunt end in a comic mismatch of disastrous proportions?<br><br>Co-written by Rachel Cohn (GINGERBREAD) and David Levithan, co-author of WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON with John Green (THE FAULT IN OUR STARS), DASH &amp; LILY'S BOOK OF DARES is&nbsp;a love story that will have readers scouring bookstore shelves, looking and longing for a love (and a red notebook) of their own.</p><p>Rachel Cohn &amp; David Levithan have written three books together. Their first, <i>Nick &amp; Norah&#x2019;s Infinite Playlist,</i> was made into a movie starring Michael Cera and Kat Dennings, directed by Peter Sollett. Their second, <i>Naomi and Ely&#x2019;s No Kiss List,</i> was named a New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age. For their third book, <i>Dash &amp; Lily&#x2019;s Book of Dares,</i> David wrote Dash&#x2019;s chapters and Rachel wrote Lily&#x2019;s.

You get to the section where a favorite author's books reside, and there, nestled in comfortably between the incredibly familiar spines, sits a red notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>What do you do?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The choice, I think, is obvious:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>You take down the red notebook and open it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>And then you do whatever it tells you to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>It was Christmastime in New York City, the most detestable time of the year. The moo-like crowds, the endless visits from hapless relatives, the ersatz cheer, the joyless attempts at joyfulness--my natural aversion to human contact could only intensify in this context. Wherever I went, I was on the wrong end of the stampede. I was not willing to grant "salvation" through any "army." I would never care about the whiteness of Christmas. I was a Decemberist, a Bolshevik, a career criminal, a philatelist trapped by unknowable anguish--whatever everyone else was not, I was willing to be. I walked as invisibly as I could through the Pavlovian spend-drunk hordes, the broken winter breakers, the foreigners who had flown halfway across the world to see the lighting of a tree without realizing how completely pagan such a ritual was.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The only bright side of this dim season was that school was shuttered (presumably so everyone could shop ad nauseam and discover that family, like arsenic, works best in small doses . . . unless you prefer to die). This year I had managed to become a voluntary orphan for Christmas, telling my mother that I was spending it with my father, and my father that I was spending it with my mother, so that each of them booked nonrefundable vacations with their post-divorce paramours. My parents hadn't spoken to each other in eight years, which gave me a lot of leeway in the determination of factual accuracy, and therefore a lot of time to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I was popping back and forth between their apartments while they were away--but mostly I was spending time in the Strand, that bastion of titillating erudition, not so much a bookstore as the collision of a hundred different bookstores, with literary wreckage strewn over eighteen miles of shelves. All the clerks there saunter-slouch around distractedly in their skinny jeans and their thrift-store button-downs, like older siblings who will never, ever be bothered to talk to you or care about you or even acknowledge your existence if their friends are around . . . which they always are. Some bookstores want you to believe they're a community center, like they need to host a cookie-making class in order to sell you some Proust. But the Strand leaves you completely on your own, caught between the warring forces of organization and idiosyncrasy, with idiosyncrasy winning every time. In other words, it was my kind of graveyard.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I was usually in the mood to look for nothing in particular when I went to the Strand. Some days I would decide that the afternoon was sponsored by a particular letter, and would visit each and every section to check out the authors whose last names began with that letter. Other days, I would decide to tackle a single section, or would investigate the recently unloaded tomes, thrown in bins that never really conformed to alphabetization. Or maybe I'd only look at books with green covers, because it had been too long since I'd read a book with a green cover.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I could have been hanging out with my friends, but most of them were hanging out with their families or their Wiis. (Wiis? Wiii? What is the plural?) I preferred to hang out with the dead, dying, or desperate books--used we call them, in a way that we'd never call a person, unless we meant it cruelly. ("Look at Clarissa . . . she's such a used girl.")&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I was horribly bookish, to the point of coming right out and saying it, which I knew was not socially acceptable. I particularly loved the adjective bookish, which I found other people used about as often as ramrod or chum or teetotaler.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>On this particular day, I decided to check out a few of my favorite authors, to see if any irregular editions had emerged from a newly deceased person's library sale. I was perusing a particular favorite (he shall remain nameless, because I might turn against him someday) when I saw a peek of red. It was a red Moleskine--made of neither mole nor skin, but nonetheless the preferred journal of my associates who felt the need to journal in non-electronic form. You can tell a lot about a person from the page she or she chooses to journal on--I was strictly a college-ruled man myself, having no talent for illustration and a microscopic scrawl that made wide-ruled seem roomy. The blank pages were usually the most popular--I only had one friend, Thibaud, who went for the grid. Or at least he did until the guidance counselors confiscated his journals to prove that he had been plotting to kill our history teacher. (This is a true story.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>There wasn't any writing on the spine of this particular journal--I had to take it off the shelf to see the front, where there was a piece of masking tape with the words DO YOU DARE? written in black Sharpie. When I opened the covers, I found a note on the first page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I've left some clues for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>If you want them, turn the page.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>If you don't, put the book back on the shelf, please.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The handwriting was a girl's. I mean, you can tell. That enchanted cursive. Either way, I would've endeavored to turn the page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>So here we are.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>1. Let's start with French Pianism.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I don't really know what it is,&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>but I'm guessing&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>nobody's going to take it off the shelf.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Charles Timbrell's your man.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>88/7/2&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>88/4/8&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Do not turn the page&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>until you fill in the blanks&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>(just don't write in the notebook, please)</p><h2>A New Friend (1) (The Adventures of Sophie Mouse)</h2><p>In this first of a charming series about a little mouse and her forest friends, Sophie Mouse must convince her classmates&#x2014;and herself&#x2014;that a new student is nothing to fear.

Silently, she unhooked it from the tiny nail pressed into the old wood and closed the key tightly in her fist. She liked the way the key became warm when she did this, the way it left a perfect imprint of itself in the soft flesh of her palm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As quietly as a cat, she padded over to her bookcase, then paused. Was the Locked sign still showing on her door? Sometimes it flipped around if she closed her door too quickly. It would be a disaster if<br>someone walked in while she was retrieving her lockbox from its hiding place. Even worse if someone walked in while the lockbox was open and saw what was inside. Jessie never showed <i>anyone</i> her saved-up money. That was just asking for trouble!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her door and poked her head out to make sure that the Locked sign was in place. As long as the sign was on her door, no one was allowed to come into her room. That was the rule in the Treski house.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could hear her mother packing in her room across the hall&#x2014;a dresser drawer opening, the sound of footsteps crossing the wooden floor, hangers jangling in a closet. Jessie frowned. She didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;<br>like her mother going away. But there was nothing she could do about it now. This was one of those situations where she would have to &#x201c;adapt and evolve,&#x201d; as her mother sometimes said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Hey, Jess, can I ask you something?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie jumped at the sound of her brother&#x2019;s voice as he came up the stairs. Evan had been in the basement all morning, banging away on some old wooden boards. She&#x2019;d thought she was safe from his prying eyes! She clutched the key more tightly in her hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Not right now. I&#x2019;m busy.&#x201d; Jessie started to retreat into her room, but she stopped when she noticed that her brother was carrying a book in his hands. Evan never carried books. He hated books. To him, they were the enemy, making him feel small and dumb. It didn&#x2019;t help that Jessie, who was thirteen months younger, was such a good reader. She looked at the book, wondering what it could possibly be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was old, whatever it was. The edges of the brown leather cover looked like they were crumbling, and&nbsp;<br>the fancy gold lettering on the spine was half flaked off. Evan held it slightly open, his fingers curled around the edge to mark the page.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll take two seconds,&#x201d; he said, half pleading, half ordering.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Not now!&#x201d; Jessie replied. She tapped the Locked sign on her door for emphasis, just so he&#x2019;d remember the rule, and went back into her room, closing the door tightly behind her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, she waited two whole minutes (&#x201c;one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi . . .&#x201d;) to make sure Evan had left the hallway and wasn&#x2019;t listening at her door, before she tiptoed to her bookcase and retrieved the lockbox she kept hidden behind the row of books on the top shelf.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lockbox was heavy because of all the coins she&#x2019;d been collecting for the past few months. It was surprising how many pennies, nickels, and dimes you could find if you just kept your eyes on the ground. Jessie&#x2019;s mom said that Jessie had a talent for finding money, but it wasn&#x2019;t a talent so much as a passion. Most kids wouldn&#x2019;t even bother to pick up<br>&nbsp;a penny if they spotted it, but Jessie never let a coin pass without scooping it up and putting it in her pocket. She also saved her gift money and chore money, and now her lockbox was terrifically heavy and made the most wonderful rattling sound when she shook it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie sat cross-legged on her bed and opened the box. There were dollar bills and coins, the blue ribbon Evan and Jessie had won in the Labor Day contest last summer, several comment cards from her best friend, Megan, postcards from her dad, and a handwritten survey about love in the fourth grade, in which someone in her class had admitted to having a crush on Jessie. Anonymously! Jessie wasn&#x2019;t even sure why she kept that particular piece of paper, but every time she decided to throw it out, she ended up putting it back in the lockbox. It was evidence! Of what, she wasn&#x2019;t sure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stopped for a moment to look at the postcards from her dad. The stamps&#x2014;from Turkey, Afghanistan, Congo, and Rwanda&#x2014;were like little pieces of art.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie liked the bright colors and strange pictures.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her parents had been divorced for three years now. Her dad sent postcards and packages every few months, and sometimes he came for a visit. But it had been more than a year since she&#x2019;d seen him. She thought about her dad every night before falling asleep, but she had learned not to ask her mother about him. She never got the answers she wanted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie organized the postcards from oldest to newest and put them aside in a neat pile. Then she turned her attention back to the lockbox. She wanted to take all the coins to the bank and exchange them for dollar bills. But to do that, she had to put all the pennies, nickels, and dimes into the&nbsp;<br>special paper rolls that the bank gave her. Fifty pennies for the penny roll, forty nickels for the nickel roll, and fifty dimes for the dime roll.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie knew exactly how much money she had in her lockbox: eighty-one dollars and forty-three cents. She kept a piece of paper with the current total tucked away at the bottom of the lockbox. Whenever she added more money, she changed the total.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But eighty-one dollars and forty-three cents wasn&#x2019;t enough&#x2014;not for what Jessie wanted. She wanted to open her very own bank account so that her money would be safe, no matter what. Once her money was in the bank, she wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about losing it or someone stealing it or even the house burning down. It would always be there. Safe. <i>That&#x2019;s why they call it a safe!</i> She imagined the big bank vault where the money was kept. Because once your money is in a bank, it&#x2019;s <i>safe.<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately for Jessie, the minimum deposit was one hundred dollars. She was a long way from that amount, with no prospects for earning money&#x2014;big money&#x2014;in sight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Jess, open up!&#x201d; called Evan from the hallway.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Locked!&#x201d; shouted Jessie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, I know. So open up, would ya?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie closed the lockbox and shoved it under her pillow. Then she went to her door and opened it a crack.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan stood there with the old book open in his hands. His finger was marking a spot on the page.<br>&#x201c;What is . . . ?&#x201d; he said, pushing the book toward her. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie took the book out of her brother&#x2019;s hands as he walked into her room. Even though she was only nine, Jessie could read at a tenth grade level. She&#x2019;d been tested. That&#x2019;s one of the reasons she had skipped a year, so that now Evan and Jessie were in the same fourth grade class.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She began to read out loud.</p> <p><i>The Rabbit Box. This, as its name indicates, is a box for causing the disappearance of a rabbit. The opening is oval, measuring about eight inches by six, and closed by a double flap, divided down the middle (see Fig. 268). As the rabbit requires considerable space, and, moreover, involves the necessity of some sort of an inclosure to prevent an unexpected reappearance of the animal, it is a convenient plan to devote to it a small special table (see Fig. 269). The interior of the table should be well padded with hay that the animal may not be hurt by its sudden descent.<br></i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What the heck is this book?&#x201d; asked Jessie, flipping to the cover and staring at it. She read the scripty gold letters across the front: <i>Modern Magic: A Practical Treatise on the Art of Conjuring </i>by Professor Hoffmann. &#x201c;Oh, this is one of Grandma&#x2019;s books! This one is <i>old.</i>&#x201d; She turned to the title page.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Published 1876!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Why are you reading one of Grandma&#x2019;s old books?&#x201d; Grandma had more books than anyone Jessie had ever known, and now that she had moved in with the Treskis, her books were all over the house.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Because I need a big finish for my magic act,&#x201d; said Evan. &#x201c;Everyone says you have to end your show with a big illusion. Not just some dumb card trick.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Your card tricks are good!&#x201d; said Jessie. Ever since Grandma had given Evan a magic kit for Christmas, he&#x2019;d been practicing all kinds of tricks, which he called illusions. He could pull a quarter from someone&#x2019;s ear, make the ace of spades jump from the front of the deck to the back, and put together a piece of rope that had been cut in half. Sometimes he would tell Jessie how the trick was done, but usually he just said, &#x201c;Magician&#x2019;s secret.&#x201d; Jessie knew he was trying to work up a magic act to perform for a real audience. She wished she could do something that people wanted to see.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Not good enough,&#x201d; said Evan. &#x201c;I need to make something <i>disappear.</i> That&#x2019;s what makes the great magicians great. David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;He did not!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;He did too. I saw it on Hulu. It was a trick, but no one knows for sure how he did it.&#x201d; Jessie watched&nbsp;<br>as her brother pulled a quarter out of his pants pocket and started flipping it across the knuckles of his right hand. The coin looked like it was dancing across his fingers. These days, Evan always carried a quarter with him so he could practice anytime. With his other hand, he pointed at the open page of the book. &#x201c;So, that rabbit box&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t say how to make it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie shook her head and handed the book back to Evan. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too complicated. And it&#x2019;s made out of metal.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; said Evan, sitting down on her bed. &#x201c;I was thinking maybe I could make it out of wood, though. I thought maybe Pete could help me. He&#x2019;s got a table saw and everything.&#x201d; Pete was the carpenter who had fixed Grandma&#x2019;s old house after she accidentally set it on fire. Pete could make anything.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Pete&#x2019;s five hours away,&#x201d; said Jessie. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s he going to help you build something?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; said Evan, staring at the diagrams. &#x201c;I thought I could mail him a drawing, and he could cut the pieces, then mail them back to me . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you just buy a rabbit box?&#x201d; asked Jessie. &#x201c;Costs too much,&#x201d; said Evan. &#x201c;Hundreds of dollars! I checked online.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie knew Evan didn&#x2019;t have that kind of money. He probably didn&#x2019;t even have a dollar! &#x201c;Professor Hoffmann doesn&#x2019;t do a very good job of explaining,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Does he give instructions for anything else? What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Jessie pointed to the book as Evan flipped the pages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Sphinx. It&#x2019;s probably the most famous illusion of all time. You&#x2019;ve got this little table with these skinny legs, and then the magician comes onstage and puts a box on top of the table, and when he opens the front of the box, there&#x2019;s a live head inside! And the head <i>talks</i> to the audience and answers questions. Then the magician closes the box, and when he opens it again, there&#x2019;s nothing but a pile of dust where the head was.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;How does he do that?&#x201d; Jessie thought the floating head looked creepy, but if people would pay a lot of money to see it . . .<br>&#x201c;Mirrors,&#x201d; said Evan, turning to the next page. &#x201c;See?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie looked at the illustration explaining the trick.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The audience thinks they&#x2019;re looking straight through the legs of the table to the curtain in the back,&#x201d; said Evan. &#x201c;But really they&#x2019;re looking at a reflection of the curtains in a mirror. So there&#x2019;s just a man hidden behind the mirrors with his head sticking up through the table.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;We could do that!&#x201d; said Jessie. &#x201c;We have a table with three legs. The one in the front hall.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s not going to let us cut a hole in her table,&#x201d; said Evan. &#x201c;And besides, where would we get the mirrors? They have to be big.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Not that big,&#x201d; said Jessie. She was starting to get excited. An idea was forming in her head. &#x201c;The table is small, and the mirrors can be small, because I&#x2019;m small&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ll be the Sphinx!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You?&#x201d; said Evan, scoffing. &#x201c;Yeah, right. I&#x2019;d like to see that. You talk too much!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You said the head talks to the audience!&#x201d; said Jessie. She couldn&#x2019;t see why Evan didn&#x2019;t like her idea.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, but it&#x2019;s&#x2014;<i>mysterious</i> kind of talking. Not the way you talk.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I can be mysterious,&#x201d; said Jessie. She would practice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Nah, Jess,&#x201d; said Evan, closing the book. &#x201c;It just wouldn&#x2019;t work. You have to be really&#x201d;&#x2014; he stopped for a minute to think &#x2014;&#x201c;quick and quiet and . . . <i>smooth</i> to be a magician&#x2019;s assistant.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie crossed her arms. It wasn&#x2019;t fair. She wanted to help.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You know what you can do, though?&#x201d; asked Evan. &#x201c;Lend me twenty bucks.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie stiffened. That was not the kind of help she wanted to give. &#x201c;What do you need twenty bucks for?&#x201d; Twenty dollars was a <i>lot</i> of money.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Rabbits don&#x2019;t grow on trees,&#x201d; said Evan. &#x201c;And they don&#x2019;t eat trees, either!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to buy a rabbit?&#x201d; Jessie nearly shouted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Sh-h-h-h,&#x201d; said Evan, pointing toward their mother&#x2019;s open bedroom door. &#x201c;Cripes, Jessie! You see what I mean?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Mom is not going to let you buy a rabbit!&#x201d; And suddenly Jessie remembered that she was mad at Evan. It was his fault their mom was leaving.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Maybe I can talk her into it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s worth a try. You can&#x2019;t make a rabbit disappear unless you have a rabbit to begin with. That&#x2019;s what Professor Hoffmann says.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, well, Professor Hoffmann doesn&#x2019;t know Mom,&#x201d; said Jessie. She heard a car pull up outside and then a car door open and slam shut. Jessie thought this was weird, since Peggy wasn&#x2019;t supposed to arrive for another two hours. Peggy was Mom&#x2019;s best friend from when she was in elementary school, and she was the one who was going to stay with them for the week that Mom was gone. Abandoning them. <i>That&#x2019;s</i> what Mom was doing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;But if she says yes, will you lend me twenty?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;No!&#x201d; said Jessie, moving to the window and peering down at the driveway. All she saw was a taxicab driving down the street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay interest!&#x201d; said Evan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie&#x2019;s ears perked up. &#x201c;How much?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; said Evan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Five percent!&#x201d; said Jessie. &#x201c;Per month!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Is that a lot?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Depends,&#x201d; said Jessie, shrugging. Five percent per month <i>was</i> kind of a lot of interest. Especially since the bank these days was paying zero interest...</p></p><h2>Red Dragon (Hannibal Lecter Series)</h2><p><b>THE <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER<br><br>Feed your fears with this terrifying classic that introduced cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter.</b><br><br>FBI agent Will Graham once risked his sanity to capture Hannibal Lecter, an ingenious killer like no other. Now, he&#x2019;s following the bloodstained pattern of the Tooth Fairy, a madman who&#x2019;s already wiped out two families. <br><br>To find him, Graham has to understand him. To understand him, Graham has only one place left to go: the mind of Dr. Lecter.</p><p>Lying on a cot in his cell with Alexandre Dumas's <i>Le Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine</i> open on his chest, Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter makes his debut in this legendary horror novel, which is even better than its sequel, <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>. As in <i>Silence</i>, the pulse-pounding suspense plot involves a hypersensitive FBI sleuth who consults psycho psychiatrist Lecter for clues to catching a killer on the loose.<p> The sleuth, Will Graham, actually quit the FBI after nearly getting killed by Lecter while nabbing him, but fear isn't what bugs him about crime busting. It's just too creepy to get inside a killer's twisted mind. But he comes back to stop a madman who's been butchering entire families. The FBI needs Graham's insight, and Graham needs Lecter's genius. But Lecter is a clever fiend, and he manipulates both Graham and the killer at large from his cell.</p><p> That killer, Francis Dolarhyde, works in a film lab, where he picks his victims by studying their home movies. He's obsessed with William Blake's bizarre painting <i>The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun</i>, believing there's a red dragon within him, the personification of his demonic drives. Flashbacks to Dolarhyde's terrifying childhood and superb stream-of-consciousness prose get us right there inside his head. When Dolarhyde does weird things, we understand why. We <i>sympathize</i> when the voice of the cruel dead grandma who raised and crazed him urges him to mayhem--she's way scarier than that old bat in <i>Psycho</i>. When he falls in love with a blind girl at the lab, we hope he doesn't give in to Grandma's violent advice.</p><p> This book is awesomely detailed, ingeniously plotted, judiciously gory, and fantastically imagined.

As a flight director in NASA&#x2019;s Mission Control, Kranz witnessed firsthand the making of history. He participated in the space program from the early days of the Mercury program to the last Apollo mission, and beyond. He endured the disastrous first years when rockets blew up and the United States seemed to fall further behind the Soviet Union in the space race. He helped to launch Alan Shepard and John Glenn, then assumed the flight director&#x2019;s role in the Gemini program, which he guided to fruition. With his teammates, he accepted the challenge to carry out President John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s commitment to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. <br> <br>Kranz recounts these thrilling historic events and offers new information about the famous flights. What appeared as nearly flawless missions to the Moon were, in fact, a series of hair-raising near misses. When the space technology failed, as it sometimes did, the controllers&#x2019; only recourse was to rely on their skills and those of their teammates. He reveals behind-the-scenes details to demonstrate the leadership, discipline, trust, and teamwork that made the space program a success. <br> <br>A fascinating firsthand account by a veteran mission controller of one of America&#x2019;s greatest achievements, <i>Failure is Not an Option</i> reflects on what has happened to the space program and offers his own bold suggestions about what we ought to be doing in space now.</p><p>In 1957, the Russians launched <i>Sputnik</i> and the ensuing space race. Three years later, Gene Kranz left his aircraft testing job to join NASA and champion the American cause. What he found was an embryonic department run by whiz kids (such as himself), sharp engineers and technicians who had to create the Mercury mission rules and procedure from the ground up. As he says, "Since there were no books written on the actual methodology of space flight, we had to write them as we went along."<p> Kranz was part of the mission control team that, in January 1961, launched a chimpanzee into space and successfully retrieved him, and made Alan Shepard the first American in space in May 1961. Just two months later they launched Gus Grissom for a space orbit, John Glenn orbited Earth three times in February 1962, and in May of 1963 Gordon Cooper completed the final Project Mercury launch with 22 Earth orbits. And through them all, and the many Apollo missions that followed, Gene Kranz was one of the integral inside men--one of those who bore the responsibility for the <i>Apollo 1</i> tragedy, and the leader of the "tiger team" that saved the <i>Apollo 13</i> astronauts.</p><p> Moviegoers know Gene Kranz through Ed Harris's Oscar-nominated portrayal of him in <i>Apollo 13</i>, but Kranz provides a more detailed insider's perspective in his book <i>Failure Is Not an Option</i>. You see NASA through his eyes, from its primitive days when he first joined up, through the 1993 shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, his last mission control project. His memoir, however, is not high literature. Kranz has many accomplishments and honors to his credit, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, but this is his first book, and he's not a polished author. There are, perhaps, more behind-the-scenes details and more paragraphs devoted to what Cape Canaveral looked like than the general public demands. If, however, you have a long-standing fascination with aeronautics, if you watched <i>Apollo 13</i> and wanted more, <i>Failure Is Not an Option</i> will fill the bill. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>Eugene F. Kranz joined the NASA Space Task Group in 1960 and was Assistant Flight Director for Project Mercury (the original manned space missions). He continued as Flight Director for the Apollo 11 lunar landing. He is a co-recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his work leading the Apollo 13 teams. <i>Failure Is Not an Option</i> is his first book. He lives with his family near Houston, Texas.</p><h2>Counting on Community</h2><p><i>Counting on Community</i> is Innosanto Nagara's follow-up to his hit ABC book, <i>A is for Activist</i>. Counting up from one stuffed pi�ata to ten hefty hens--and always counting on each other--children are encouraged to recognize the value of their community, the joys inherent in healthy eco-friendly activities, and the agency they posses to make change.

On Sundays, she often attends Baptist services with her friends, and Miss Eula fixes a sumptuous fried chicken dinner with all the trimmings, after stopping to admire the hats in Mr. Kodinski's shop. The youngsters hope to buy her one, but when they approach the merchant looking for work, he mistakenly accuses them of pelting his shop with eggs. To prove their innocence, the children hand-dye eggs in the folk-art style that Patricia's grandmother had taught her and present them to the milliner. Moved by the rememberance of his homeland, the Russian Jewish emigre encourages the children to sell the ``Pysanky'' eggs in his shop and rewards their industry with a gift of the hat, which Miss Eula proudly wears on Easter Sunday. Polacco's tale resonates with the veracity of a personal recollection and is replete with vivid visual and visceral images. Her unique illustrative style smoothly blends detailed line drawing, impressionistic painting, primitive felt-marker coloring, and collage work with actual photographs, resulting in a feast for the eyes as filling as Miss Eula's Chicken Sunday spreads. The palette is equally varied, while the application of color is judiciously relieved by sporadic pencil sketches. An authentic tale of childhood friendship. --Dorothy Houlihan, formerly at White Plains Pub .

Here are sugar barons and their armies conquering the Caribbean, Paul Revere stopping for a nip during his famous ride, Prohibitionists marching against "demon rum," Hemingway fattening his liver with Havana daiquiris, and today's bartenders reviving old favorites like Planter's Punch. <br><br>In an age of microbrewed beer and single-malt whiskeys, rum--once the swill of the common man--has found its way into the tasting rooms of the most discriminating drinkers. Complete with cocktail recipes for would-be epicurean time-travelers, this is history at its most intoxicating.</p><p><b>Wayne Curtis</b> was the spirits and cocktails columnist for <i>The Atlantic</i> magazine for eight years, and has also written about drinks for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Imbibe</i>, <i>The Daily Beast</i>, and <i>The American Scholar</i>. In 2002 Curtis was named Lowell Thomas Travel Journalist of the Year by the Society of American Travel Writers. He lives in New Orleans and Maine.Chapter 1<br><br> [ Kill-devil ]<br><br> The people have a very generous fashion that if one come to a house to inquire the way to any place, they will make him drink, and if the traveler does deny to stay to drink they take it very unkindly of him. &#x2014;Henry Whistler on Barbados customs, 1655<br><br> Rum&#x2014;a spirit distilled from the juice of a sugarcane plant or its by-products&#x2014;was first invented in the early seventeenth century on the British island colony of Barbados.<br><br> Or not. In which case it may have been invented on the Spanish islands of Hispaniola or Cuba (where it would have been called aguadiente, or &#x201c;burning water&#x201d;), or by Portuguese colonists on the coast of Brazil (where it would later be called cacha�a). Or possibly it was first distilled by the French on one of their Caribbean island strongholds (where the poorer grades of rum were known as tafia). On the other hand, it may have been first concocted in the 1400s somewhere in Europe by secretive alchemists searching for the elixir of life and feeding through their retorts whatever fermentable matter they could get their hands on. Or just maybe it was invented even earlier by an anonymous chemist tinkering near the cane fields of coastal India.<br><br> The thing is, no one really knows when rum first appeared. If you want to know about the history of sugar, overflowing archives provide enough information to lead to mental obesity. But for rum, it&#x2019;s a starvation diet. The West Indian island of Barbados has long claimed that first Barbadians invented rum, and it&#x2019;s telling that no historians have roused themselves to seriously dispute this point. Some, like rum expert Edward Hamilton, have argued that rum was first produced commercially in the Portuguese or Spanish colonies, probably in Brazil, and he has been rooting around for customs documents or ship manifests to back this up. He hasn&#x2019;t found anything yet. (And he guesses he may never: Rum exports from the colonies were prohibited by Spain and Portugal, which meant any rum produced was smuggled and undocumented. And even if it had been documented, the ports of the West Indies were laid waste by attackers with numbing regularity, so the archives of the earliest days are often nonexistent.)<br><br> This much at least is known about rum: Sometime around the middle of the seventeenth century, an outbreak of rum occurred almost everywhere the Dutch, Spanish, French, and English were engaged in their New World errand-running. The British sea captain John Josselyn wrote of a dinner held on a ship off the coast of present-day Maine in September 1639, at which another captain toasted him with a pint of rum. Laws controlling the sale of rum abruptly cropped up in different colonies, as a warden in pursuit of a persistent truant&#x2014;in Bermuda in 1653, in Connecticut in 1654, in Massachusetts in 1657.<br><br> Then, sometime shortly before 1650, rum surfaced at an extravagant feast held at the Barbados estate of James Drax, the most important planter on Great Britain&#x2019;s most important island colony. For anyone curious about the cultural history of rum&#x2014;or who wants to learn about the ancestry of that bottle of West Indian rum in the back of their liquor cabinet&#x2014;I&#x2019;d argue that this is as fine a place to begin the story as any.<br><br> P<br><br> Barbados is pear-shaped and just twenty-one miles long by fourteen miles wide&#x2014;or about one-seventh the size of Rhode Island. On a map of the Caribbean, Barbados lies far to the east, like a wayward child refusing to stand in line with the rest of the Lesser Antilles, which sweep in a great arc from Puerto Rico to Trinidad. Adventurers from Portugal and Spain landed here in the sixteenth century, but finding no precious metals to mine nor Indians to enslave, they lingered only long enough to name the island &#x201c;Los Barbados,&#x201d; after the &#x201c;bearded&#x201d; fig trees. Barbados lay unmolested until 1625, when a British sailing ship stopped off while heading home from Brazil. The captain claimed the island for the British throne and reported on its pleasing qualities to Sir William Courteen, the ship&#x2019;s owner. Courteen hastened to cobble together a syndicate, then dispatched a ship with supplies to support several dozen colonists. On February 20, 1627, eighty colonists&#x2014;plus ten slaves captured along the way&#x2014;disembarked near present-day Holetown on the island&#x2019;s west coast.<br><br> The mandate given the first settlers by Courteen was not complicated: Go forth and produce. Specifically, produce for export such things as were in demand in England. The colonists tried growing cotton, indigo, and fustic wood, the latter a sort of tropical mulberry useful in making yellow dye. These crops did not produce great fortunes. Taking a cue from the colony at Virginia, which had been settled two decades earlier, the islanders planted tobacco, which was then the most profitable agricultural staple in the colonies. But a glut in London soon undercut prices, and Barbados tobacco was hampered by another problem: It was &#x201c;so earthy and worthless,&#x201d; wrote one seventeenth-century island visitor, that it provided &#x201c;little or no return from England.&#x201d; A 1628 shipment was described as &#x201c;foul, full of stalks, and evil colored.&#x201d; Even the islanders wouldn&#x2019;t smoke it.<br><br> And then came sugar.<br><br> The species Saccharum officinarum (&#x201c;sugar of the apothecaries&#x201d;), a freakishly tall and sharp-edged grass, had first appeared around 4000 b.c. in Asia, most likely in Papua New Guinea, where primitive agriculturists had selected the sweetest canes for further breeding. These plants migrated eastward with traders, to India and on to the Mediterranean. In 325 b.c. a general under Alexander the Great came upon sugarcane for the first time and described it with wonder as a plant that &#x201c;brings forth honey without the help of bees.&#x201d;<br><br> Sugar soon became an essential crop in the colonial Atlantic islands off Africa, including Madeira, the Canary Islands, and the Azores. It made the leap to the New World with Christopher Columbus, whose father-in-law was a Madeira sugar planter. On the explorer&#x2019;s second trip across the Atlantic in 1493, he brought live sugarcane seedlings and oversaw their planting on Hispaniola. The sugar grew fabulously, and colonists were quick to establish plantations over the next two decades in Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. The Portuguese, demonstrating a flair for running complex businesses in difficult environments far from home, planted cane aggressively on the damp Brazilian coast and brought in sugar presses and copper boiling vats from home. The number of sugar refineries in Brazil grew from 5 in 1550 to 350 less than a century later. With great quantities of sugar now being produced in the New World, the price fell, and many of the sugar producers of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands were ruined. The New World sugar era was dawning.<br><br> Barbados made the most of it. In England, the demand for sugar soared as it quickly evolved from a luxury for aristocrats to a staple for the masses. It was in great demand for making sweets, masking the taste of rancid meat, and sweetening new beverages, including coffee (which arrived in Britain in 1650), chocolate (1657), and tea (1660). Between 1660 and 1700, the per capita consumption of sugar in England quadrupled, and then it doubled again in the next quarter century. The value of sugar shipped to England and Wales was worth twice that of tobacco by the end of the seventeenth century.<br><br> With reports filtering home of great fortunes being made, thousands of British colonists boarded ships for the West Indies. The well-off paid for their outbound trips and brought enough cash to acquire some acreage and build a sugar works or two. Those unable to afford the �6 trip traded passage and board by signing on as indentured servants, typically committing to seven years of labor on a plantation, after which they would be freed and given a small parcel of land. A third group washed ashore on the islands: thieves and petty criminals, who were exiled from England to the West Indies much as later undesirables would be shipped off to Australia. Slaves from Africa, too, were beginning to arrive in great numbers against their will, imported by the sugar planters to work the expanding fields. The population of Barbados swelled from just 80 in 1627 to more than 75,000 by 1650.<br><br> James Drax&#x2014;later Sir James Drax&#x2014;arrived on Barbados in 1627 among the first wave of settlers. He began by planting tobacco, then switched to sugarcane. He quickly amassed an estate of 850 acres, which yielded a torrent of cash. Drax was the first to build island windmills, which were expensive but more efficient and productive than cattle-powered mills. His wealth grew, and he had plenty of company. &#x201c;It is seldom seen that the ingenious or the industrious fail of raising their fortunes in any part of the Indies,&#x201d; wrote one planter to an acquaintance in England. Another noted in 1655 that Barbados was &#x201c;one of the richest spots of ground in the world,&#x201d; adding that the gentry there &#x201c;live far better than ours do in England.&#x201d;<br><br> In England, architects had been flirting with a hybrid style for British manor houses, mixing elements of Gothic and classic. The results were often eye-catching, although not always in a good way. The planters commissioned dozens of similarly grand homes of coral stone smoothed with plaster. Drax&#x2019;s great house was three stories and featured a carved mastic archway near a grand staircase, the whole pile capped with angular gables and studded with corner finials. Such homes were notably ill-suited for the tropical weather, and many were, oddly, built with fireplaces. One visitor marveled that the planters, who spent afternoons indoors drinking spirits and smoking pipes, did not spontaneously combust.<br><br> Just as the houses were ill-designed for the stifling heat, so, too, were colonial island fashions. Merchant ships laden with current London styles would arrive with jackets and gowns unsuitable for the oppressive tropics. Yet the fashionable were undaunted. &#x201c;One may see men loaded and half melting under a ponderous coat and waistcoat,&#x201d; noted an early visitor to Jamaica, another thriving British colony, &#x201c;richly bedaubed with gold lace or embroidery on a hot day, scarcely able to bear them.&#x201d;<br><br> Through happy circumstance, these planters inhabited one of those rare junctures of time and place when money seemingly tumbled out of the sky. Sugar was king, the source of instant fortunes, taking on the role that railroads, oil, and the Internet would later play in North America. In the mid-seventeenth century, Barbados was the wealthiest colony in the budding British empire, as well as its most populous. The free white men of the islands had a net worth several times that of even the most industrious colonists on the North American mainland. Barbados produced more sugar and employed more shippers than all the other British West Indian islands put together. The island&#x2019;s moment was to last for decades; as late as 1715, the value of exports from Barbados exceeded not only that of the other islands, but of all the other British North American colonies (island and mainland) combined. The city of Bridgetown in the seventeenth century was bigger and more prosperous than Manhattan.<br><br> The wealth that flowed back to England was immense. A writer in 1708 likened Barbados to a massive gold or silver mine being excavated for the benefit of the homeland and claimed that trade with the island supported sixty thousand people in England. The other British islands, like St. Christopher, Nevis, Jamaica, and Antigua, also contributed to the fortunes flowing back across the Atlantic, and the planters and their agents saw little that couldn&#x2019;t be improved with gilding. In one well-known encounter, King George III and his prime minister were riding near Weymouth, England, when they were all but forced off the road by an extravagant carriage accompanied by a great many outriders in flamboyant clothing. The king was informed that the procession was that of a sugar planter from Jamaica. &#x201c;Sugar, sugar, hey? All that sugar!&#x201d; said the king. &#x201c;How are the duties, hey, Pitt, how are the duties?&#x201d;<br><br> One of those attracted to Barbados was Richard Ligon, who arrived under circumstances not wholly of his own choosing. A British royalist who had lost his business during the convulsions of the English rebellion, Ligon set off for the island in June 1647 with five acquaintances. The group acquired and managed a sugar estate, and Ligon remained on the island until 1650. His account is not only the chief source of information about early island life, but an enchanting chronicle, in large part because Ligon never lost his capacity to marvel in the face of great hardships. Barbados was in the throes of a yellow fever epidemic when he arrived, with the disease (by one accounting) killing six thousand inhabitants. Ligon, who nearly died of the fever three times himself, wrote that &#x201c;the living were hardly able to bury the dead.&#x201d;<br><br> Yet Ligon was endlessly enthusiastic about the island&#x2019;s charms, including the incomparable taste of pineapple juice (&#x201c;certainly the Nectar which the Gods drunk&#x201d;) and the succulence of the feral pigs descended from swine abandoned by early Portuguese mariners (&#x201c;the sweetest flesh . . . and the loveliest to look on in a dish, either boyl&#x2019;d, roasted, or bak&#x2019;d&#x201d;). Given his persistent good cheer, it&#x2019;s all the more striking that Ligon wrote A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbadoes (1657) while confined to an English debtor&#x2019;s prison, into which he was tossed upon his return from the West Indies. (Ligon&#x2019;s experience shows that not every colonist came home burdened with fortune.)<br><br> Historian Lowell Ragatz has written that new arrivals on the island were often astounded by the &#x201c;gastronomic feats&#x201d; performed at plantation feasts. &#x201c;In violation of all rules of dietetics, huge quantities of heavy food and drink were disposed of,&#x201d; Ragatz wrote.<br><br> Indeed, Drax hosted one such feast, where the offerings might have intimidated Falstaff. Ligon was there, and he reported that it began with a first course of fourteen beef dishes, featuring a cow especially fattened in a private pasture of abundant forage. Its breast, rump, and cheeks were variously roasted, boiled, and baked. The legs and head went into a spiced stew, and the tongue and tripe were made into a meat pie seasoned with currants and finely minced sweet herbs.<br><br> Then came the second course. It included a leg of pork and boiled chicken and shoulder of mutton and a young goat, its belly filled with a pudding. There was veal loin dressed with oranges, lemons, and limes, and a suckling pig served in a sauce of claret, sage, nutmeg, and brains. (The pig was &#x201c;the fattest, whitest, and sweetest in the world,&#x201d; Ligon wrote.) Then came three turkeys and two capons and two hens (served with their own eggs) and four ducklings and three rabbits and eight turtledoves and, for good measure, Spanish bacon. And oysters and caviar and olives and a potato pudding and a piquant relish made of fish eggs.</p><h2>Mark Twain Geography Workbook, Geography for Kids Grade 7-8, Population, Political, Climate, Physical Geography of the Eastern Hemisphere, 7th Grade Workbooks &amp; Up, Classroom or Homeschool Curriculum</h2><p>Explore the world with students in grades 7&#x2013;8 using Discovering the World of Geography.

But their fun quickly vanishes when Jonathan, his sister, Abby, and their dog, Moose, find themselves in the middle of a natural disaster. A devastating earthquake has hit, destroying their camper, knocking out the only bridge to the mainland, and leaving Jonathan, Abby, and their dog with no food, water, or shelter. Alone in the woods, can Jonathan manage to keep calm and save Abby and Moose&#x2014;and stay alive himself?</p><p>Peg Kehret was born in Wisconsin, grew up in Minnesota, spent fourteen years in California, and now lives with her husband in Washington State. They have two grown children, four grandchildren, one dog, and one cat.<p>Peg's novels for children are regularly recommended by the American Library Association, the International Reading Association, and the Children's Book Council. She has won many state "young reader" or "children's choice" awards. Peg's characters are ordinary kids who find themselves in exciting situations and who use their wits to solve their problems. There is usually humor as well as suspense in her books. A long-time volunteer at The Humane Society, she often uses animals in her stories.</p><p>Before she began writing books for children, Peg published plays, short stories, articles, and two books for adults. She is a frequent speaker at conferences for librarians and teachers.</p><p>At the age of twelve, Peg had polio and was paralyzed from the neck down. Because she can remember that experience and her year of recovery so vividly, she finds it easy to write in the viewpoint of a twelve or thirteen year old. Most of her main characters are that age. Her autobiography, <b>Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio</b>, won the Golden Kite Award from the Society of Children's Book Writers &amp; Illustrators, and the PEN Center USA West Award for Children's Literature.</p><p>When she is not writing, Peg likes to watch baseball, bake cookies, and pump her old player piano.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Gr 5-7-Jonathan and his family are the only campers on Magpie Island, and the deserted grounds make Jonathan ill at ease. Soon after they arrive, his mother slips and injures her ankle. Jonathan offers to stay at the campground with his six-year old physically handicapped sister so his parents can get to the hospital quickly. Just after they leave, a devastating earthquake strikes, destroying Abby's walker, the camper, and the only bridge off the island. The island quickly floods, and the children and their loyal dog are stranded without supplies. Throughout his ordeal, Jonathan displays the patience, courage, and tenacity of one far older than 12, facing each new crisis with resolve. Youngsters may find it hard to comprehend how the family could be so out of touch, but Peg Kehret wrote this story (Puffin, 1998) before cell phones became a necessity. How Jonathan manages to save himself and his nearly helpless sister is a tense tale, and the danger increases with each chapter. Charles Carroll's reading, although clear and precise, doesn't aptly convey the story's tone of suspense and danger. Still, fans of adventure novels will be delighted as the youngsters battle to stay alive.-MaryAnn Karre, West Middle School, Binghamton, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Learning to react calmly and appropriately is NOT something that comes easy to MOST kids, and is a skill that needs to be taught and reinforced. --Kim Gameroz, Behavioral Support Specialist<br><br>It is all too easy for us grownups to criticize a child who blows up when things don't go his way. We forget that there is no 'small stuff' for little kids. Everything is really, really important! Want an example? We have seven balls for two kids to play with, each ball a different color. For some reason, the blue ball is the ONLY ball worth playing with, and there are tantrums galore from the kid who got stuck with one of those other suckie balls. This book holds up a mirror to our boys' behavior, and has given them something to think about. The main character is a likeable kid, and we all enjoy reading the book together. --Diane from the Bay Area, Amazon<br><br>This book is about a boy, Braden, that overreacts to several different situations. His mother talks to him about a 4-step process she learned from her Grandfather to react calmly, and throughout the book there are examples of Braden putting those steps into play, while also describing a parent's role in implementing and facilitating these changes in thought process. The situations that Braden is placed in are ones that many children experience, which helps the child reading to identify with the character and think about what their reaction would be in these situations. This book is a little lengthy and might not be as interesting to those children without this particular behavior issue, but for parents and children who struggle with overreacting and subsequent negative consequences, this book is great to help give guidance for both parties! --Corrie M, Amazon</p><h2>The Wisdom of No Escape: and the Path of Loving-Kindness</h2><p>It&#39;s true, as they say, that we can only love others when we first love ourselves.

It all begins with Atkins!</p></p><p>Designed to catapult your body into a state of fat meltdown, Dr. Atkins's diet has taken America by storm. It targets insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. The bodies of most overeaters are continually in a state of hyperinsulinism; their bodies are so adept at releasing insulin to help convert excess carbohydrates to fat that there's always too much of the hormone circulating through the body. This puts the body into a bind; it always wants to store fat. Even when people with hyperinsulinism try to lose weight--especially when they cut fat but increase carbohydrate consumption--their efforts will fail. This is why Dr. Atkins refers to insulin as "the fat-producing hormone." <p> Dr. Atkins's diet is extremely low in carbohydrates, which helps to regulate insulin production and decrease circulating insulin; less insulin soon results in less fat storage and fewer food cravings. The diet is far from torturous, though--those who've tried it attest that hunger is <i>not</i> a part of this plan. Ninety percent of Dr. Atkins's patients--more than 25,000 of them--have experienced dramatic weight loss. The book includes recipes for such luscious, low-carb dishes as lobster soup, zabaglione, sea bass, and blueberry ice cream, and even includes a carbohydrate gram counter and menus.</p><p>WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT MAINTENANCE, GOOD HEALTH, AND DISEASE PREVENTION</p><p>JOIN THE REVOLUTION!</p>Millions of people have already discovered how to get healthy, lose weight, and keep it off&#x2014;and you can too!

She introduces two engaging mouse couples eager to get away from their everyday lives. But when they agree to swap homes, they find unexpected adventures around every corner. Lush green scenes alternate with the elegant details of a fine Victorian townhouse to make a sumptuous and stunning picture book.</p><p>With more than 34 million books in print,&nbsp;<b>Jan Brett</b>&nbsp;is one of the nation's foremost illustrators of children's books. &nbsp;As a child, she decided to be an illustrator and spent much of her time reading and drawing. As a student at the Boston Museum School, Jan spent many hours in the Museum of Fine Arts. Travel is also a constant inspiration, so with her husband,&nbsp;Joe Hearne, who is a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, she&nbsp;visits many different countries where she researches the architecture and costumes that appear in her work.&nbsp;Jan lives in a seacoast town in Massachusetts.Kindergarten-Grade 3-A new spin on the familiar fable. A mouse couple living in a town are enchanted by the simple life of the country, and, while on a picnic, meet a pair of local mice who long for the luxury and convenience of the city. Homes are swapped, but they find that reality is different from their expectations. Both couples end up fleeing from unfamiliar, predators-a cat in town and an owl in the country-all the way home. The owl and cat collide, and in an original twist, negotiate a territorial swap of their own. Traditionally, the town resident is portrayed as a pompous snob who turns his nose up at the country dweller's simple fare, while the country mouse is a folksy bumpkin. In Brett's version, the town mice are as charming and naive as their country cousins. Furthermore, the original fable depicts country life as utterly tranquil, but the city mice find that it is anything but serene. Brett's narrative alternates the parallel mishaps of the two sets of mice with lively, smooth writing and a deft touch of humor. As with any of her books, the illustrations are rich with meticulous detail. The natural fibers of the clothes of the country mice are as realistic in texture as the fine beaded and bedecked clothing of the town mice. The text is neatly integrated into each double-page spread. Lozenges at either side portray the activities of the two predators and are bordered with natural objects such as buttons, stamps, coins, and safety pins. Because of the wealth of small details, the book is better suited for one-on-one sharing than as a group read aloud.<br><i>Donna L.

James: Stolen Legacy: Greek Philosophy is Stolen Egyptian Philosophy</h2><p><p>In this bold and uncompromising book, George G. M. James argues that the &#x201c;Greek philosophy&#x201d; in which nearly all of Western culture has its roots actually originated in ancient Egypt<br> Drawing on careful historical research and a radical rethinking of the conventional narrative of Greek history, James asserts that our celebration of the ancient Greeks as the creators of Western civilization and philosophy is misattributed. In fact, he argues, our praise rightfully belongs to the people of Africa. Furthermore, this massive intellectual and cultural theft has helped lend credence to the damaging notion that the entire continent of Africa has contributed nothing to world civilization.&nbsp;<br> James explorers documented connections between celebrated Greek philosophers and the influence of Egyptian thought, proposing other possible links between northern Africa and Greece as well.

Along her centerline she carried three 250-ton turrets, each hefting three eight-inch guns that could reach out eighteen miles to rake beaches, destroy pillboxes, and punch through the armor of enemy ships. Her hull bristled with two dozen 40 mm Bofors guns, some radar-aimed for lethal precision, along with thirty-two machine guns that could cloak a mile-wide circle around her in a hail of 20 mm rounds. From her decks, Fifth Fleet commander Admiral Raymond Spruance would build an island bridge that stretched west from Pearl Harbor to Japan and was mortared in the blood of nations.<br> <br>By the summer of 1945, the Pacific war was churning toward its fiery climax. A new weapon had been born, a &#x201c;destroyer of worlds.&#x201d; During the last week of July, under the command of Captain Charles B. McVay III, Indianapolis delivered the core of this weapon to its launch point, completing the most highly classified naval mission of the war. Four days later, just after midnight, a Japanese submarine spotted Indy and struck her with two torpedoes. Three hundred men went down with the ship. As Indy sank into the yawning underwater canyons of the Philippine Sea, nearly nine hundred men made it into the water alive. Only 316 survived.<br> <br>The sinking of Indianapolis was the greatest sea disaster in the history of the American Navy. It was also a national scandal that would bridge two centuries. There would be a controversial court-martial. An enemy witness. Lies and machinations by men of high rank. Broken lives. Suicides.<br> <br>Decade after decade, the survivors would fight for their captain, battling to correct a vulgar injustice. As Indy&#x2019;s story rolled forward, spanning thirteen presidents, from FDR to George W. Bush, it would inspire a filmmaker named Spielberg, an eleven-year-old boy named Hunter Scott, a maverick lawmaker named Bob Smith, and Captain William Toti, skipper of her namesake submarine. Men fought over her for decades, and no victor emerged for fifty years.<br> <br>Indianapolis is a war grave now. But don&#x2019;t think of her that way. Roll the film backward. Watch her rise.</p><h2>National Geographic The Old West</h2><p>This definitive history of the American West is full of legendary tales of tragedy and triumph, from Lewis and Clark&#x2019;s epic 1803 expedition to the showmanship of Buffalo Bill.

The black hole swallows everything he touches, which is challenging to say the least&#x2014;but also turns out to be a convenient way to get rid of those items that Stella doesn't want around. Soon the ugly sweaters her aunt has made for her all disappear within the black hole, as does the smelly class hamster she's taking care of, and most important, all the reminders of her dead father that are just too painful to have around.<br><br> It's not until Stella, her younger brother, Cosmo, the family puppy, and even the bathroom tub all get swallowed up by the black hole that Stella comes to realize she has been letting her own grief consume her. And that's not the only thing she realizes as she attempts to get back home. This is an astonishingly original and funny adventure with a great big heart.</p><p>Michelle Cuevas graduated from Williams College and holds a master of fine arts degree in creative writing from the University of Virginia.

A sad girl. A girl with a hole in her heart, and darkness on the horizon.</p><p>That girl, of course, was me.</p><p>&#x201c;My name is Stella Rodriguez,&#x201d; I told the guard at the gates to NASA. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m eleven years old. I&#x2019;m here to speak with Carl Sagan.&#x201d;</p><p>It was late, almost dark, and I was alone. You and Mom would not have approved.</p><p>The guard looked up as if he&#x2019;d heard an annoying mosquito, decided he imagined it, and went back to reading his magazine.</p><p>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; I tried again, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Carl Sagan&#x2019;s great-great-great-great-granddaughter, and I&#x2019;m here at NASA to tell him that in the future we&#x2019;ve invented time travel!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please go away,&#x201d; said the guard.</p><p>&#x201c;But I have an appointment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said the guard, &#x201c;you definitely don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Fine,</i> okay, maybe I don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; I said, a bit too loudly. &#x201c;But if you take into consideration chaos theory or the butterfly effect, the very notion of long-term predictions&#x2014;for example, an <i>appointment</i>&#x2014;becomes an absurd impossibility. Time&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>But before I could continue trying to sound scholarly, an ear-piercing alarm started ringing. Lights began flashing, and I could hear shouts from inside the building.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, putting up my hands. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all just take it easy. I&#x2019;ll go peacefully. No need for alarms. I&#x2019;m too bookish for prison!&#x201d;</p><p>But the guard wasn&#x2019;t paying attention to me. He grabbed his phone and started shouting, something about code reds and protocol, and before I knew what was happening he had run inside, leaving the gate wide open.</p><p>I wish I were the type of person who would sneak into NASA during a molecular-robot-alien-rocket-invasion-explosion. But you know very well I&#x2019;m not that type. Not even close. I&#x2019;m more of a chicken-liver-jellyfish-fraidy-cat type.</p><p>And so I left. I left without seeing Carl Sagan, or giving him the important package I&#x2019;d come to deliver. Time was of the essence, since the Voyager launch date&#x2014;August 20, 1977&#x2014;was mere months away.</p><p>Avoiding the alarms at NASA, I went to the bus stop and waited. It was the last moment of light, and I had a strange feeling. Like when you sense a breeze on your ankles in a room with no open windows or doors. Like when you&#x2019;re sure you can see a face in the moon, and it&#x2019;s staring right at you. Like when you&#x2019;re the seeker during hide-and-seek, and you just know you&#x2019;re being watched through a closet keyhole. I darted my eyes from side to side, looking in the bushes and up at the trees. I didn&#x2019;t see anything anywhere but dusk.</p><p>And so I was understandably relieved when the bus came around the bend. That is, until I got <i>on</i> the bus, and things started to get even stranger, if possible.</p><p>&#x201c;My wallet!&#x201d; shouted a businesswoman. &#x201c;Someone stole my wallet!&#x201d;</p><p>Everyone scanned the bus for a shady-looking character.</p><p>&#x201c;And where&#x2019;s my toupee?&#x201d; asked an elderly man.</p><p>This continued for three more stops, shouts of <i>Where&#x2019;s my lunch?</i> and <i>Who took my pet frog? </i>To get off the bus, I had to weather an obstacle course of people on their hands and knees searching for something-or-other under their seats.</p><p>The stop was only a few minutes from home, but it felt like miles. I mean, what was going on?! The dusk had turned to straight-up gloom, which wasn&#x2019;t good because by that point I had a severe case of the creeps, a heebie-jeebie fever, and a touch of the willies. I&#x2019;m not afraid of the dark&#x2014;you know that from all our time spent stargazing&#x2014;but the minute I started walking, I got goose bumps down my arms and legs and all the way up my neck. I had such a case of the jumps that I&#x2019;m pretty sure I had goose bumps on my eyeballs, which, by the way, were not helping because in a matter of minutes it had gone from almost-dark-outside-gloom to dark-at-the-bottom-of-a-pocket.</p><p>I looked from side to side.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; I asked. No one answered. Has anyone in any scary movie ever answered that question? <i>Oh, glad you asked, it&#x2019;s me the axe murderer. Dang it! That was actually supposed to be a surprise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>So I did what anyone in my position would do. I started to run. Fast. I ran through the dark-like-the-muck-down-a-drain, I sprinted through the dark-as-the-inside-of-a-whale. I didn&#x2019;t hear footsteps or twigs breaking behind me, but the feeling was becoming stronger. Someone was lingering just out of view. I was being watched. I was being followed.</p><p>But by who?</p><p>Or, worse still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by <i>what?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p><b>&#x2736;</b></p><p><b>Hello, Darkness</b></p><p>WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING ME UNTIL MOM GETS HOME. I COULD HAVE EATEN GLUE OR SOMETHING!&#x201d;</p><p>That shrill voice belonged, of course, to Cosmo. A fitting name given that he&#x2019;s a total space cadet of a five-year-old brother.</p><p>&#x201c;Shhhhh!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Help me batten down the hatches and secure the premises.&#x201d;</p><p>I ran around locking doors, closing all the window shades, and turning off the lights. I peered out through a crack in the front curtains. It had begun to rain and it was hard to see whatever monster had been following me home.</p><p>&#x201c;This is fun,&#x201d; whispered a voice behind me. &#x201c;What are we doing?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down at Cosmo. He squeezed his little hands in excitement.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Did</i> you eat glue?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he replied sheepishly.</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;very mature. Come on, I&#x2019;ll make us some dinner.&#x201d;</p><p>After fear-flavored grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup eaten in almost-dark, I told Cosmo I was going to do my homework, but really I just needed some alone time to think. I put on my fuzzy blue robe with the stars on it, and stared out my bedroom window on the second floor, trying to get a better view of the front yard. I tried using my telescope, but it just made me sad. Extra sad. Sadder than my lingering, everyday fog. It had been our father-daughter thing, just you and me, but now you&#x2019;re gone and there are monsters in the yard and everything is wrong.</p><p>I sat slumped with my chin on the windowsill. A raindrop slid down the glass like a tiny shooting star.</p><p>&#x201c;I wish,&#x201d; I said, closing my eyes, &#x201c;that I could make everything awful just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. disappear.&#x201d;</p><p>When I opened my eyes, I caught a glimpse of something outside, just for a moment, before it darted into a cardboard box near the trash cans on the curb.</p><p>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; I asked. I used my hand to clear the fog from the glass. Yes, there was definitely something in the box, something small, and dark, and shivering. <i>A kitten,</i> I thought, trying to convince myself that I had seen the flash of whiskers and flick of a tail.</p><p>Armed with rain boots and a flashlight, I made my way outside. Luckily, Cosmo had gone to his room and wasn&#x2019;t around to bug me.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a cat or a stray dog,&#x201d; I said to myself as I crept across the yard and through the rain.</p><p>&#x201c;Here, kitty kitty,&#x201d; I said as I got closer. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t be a skunky skunky.&#x201d;</p><p>I moved slowly and carefully, trying to see the critter. But when my flashlight lit up the inside of the box, what I saw was not a kitten or pup. It wasn&#x2019;t even a skunk. What it was was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>darkness.</i></p><p>I stumbled back away from the box, tripped on the curb, and dropped the flashlight. When I finally retrieved it, my hands were shaking as I aimed it back at what I thought I&#x2019;d seen. The thing inside was gone! I flailed the light around wildly, and found the creature, creeping closer and closer toward me. It didn&#x2019;t seem to have legs or arms. It was just a blob of darkness no bigger than a rabbit&#x2014;but not regular darkness, no. This was dark like the dark inside an old, closed book&#x2014;except with two eyes. Eyes that shimmered, and seemed to have tiny galaxies inside of them.</p><p>&#x201c;ACK!&#x201d; I yelled, pointing at the thing. The thing, in response, looked behind it to see what was so scary.</p><p>&#x201c;Stay back!&#x201d; I said. But every time I took a step away, the creature crept a little closer to me. In fact, from the way it moved and the look in its eyes, I got the craziest feeling: <i>I think it wants me to pet it.</i></p><p>But I&#x2019;m not insane. Instead, I threw my flashlight at it, hoping it would run away. To my shock, though, the flashlight didn&#x2019;t hit the creature; it just disappeared completely <i>inside</i> the thing. The flashlight was there one moment, and gone the next, absorbed without a trace.</p><p>&#x201c;What in the world&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>And then, in the dim glow of the streetlamp, the creature gave a very unceremonious, light-filled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. burp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter Three</b></p><p><b>&#x2736;</b></p><p><b>Things I Know About the Thing</b></p><p>You&#x2019;re probably wondering what I did after the creature from the cardboard box swallowed my flashlight, aren&#x2019;t you? Did I run? Call the National Guard? Faint?</p><p>Well, I did what I thought <i> you</i> would do. I invited it inside, out of the rain.</p><p>&#x201c;So this is my room,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s small, but it&#x2019;s home.&#x201d;</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t yet touched the creature. Once I started walking backward toward the house, it just sort of followed me. It didn&#x2019;t seem dangerous, but then again, how would I know? Maybe it was lulling me into a sense of security with those big, needy eyes, and was going to devour me any minute.</p><p>The thing had started swallowing stuff in my room&#x2014;nothing important, just dust bunnies and some of Cosmo&#x2019;s unidentifiable &#x201c;works of art&#x201d; that he&#x2019;d drawn for me. I dumped out a jar of pennies and scattered them around, hoping that would keep the thing busy while I made a list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Things I Know About the Thing</p><p>Very, very dark</p><p>No hands or legs, just a blob</p><p>Has eyes, I think</p><p>The eyes look like little galaxies</p><p>Swallows Absorbs Disappears anything it wants</p><p>Likes to eat flashlights, dust, poorly executed artwork, pennies</p><p>Docile (so far)</p><p>Seems to want to be touched???</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My first thought was <i>ALIEN</i>. It&#x2019;s an extraterrestrial being that escaped from NASA and followed me home. But from everything I knew about aliens, they were usually green, had arms and legs, and didn&#x2019;t want to be petted like a puppy.</p><p>I pointed to a poster of the Milky Way on my wall.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that your home?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Outer space?&#x201d;</p><p>The creature didn&#x2019;t seem to recognize the galaxy as its place of residence or, if it did, was more interested in consuming all of my left shoes one by one.</p><p>I looked and looked through all of my science books, trying to find anything that resembled this creature. And then, in a book about theoretical astronomy, I found this:<br><br></p><p><b>Black holes </b>form when a massive star dies and collapses into itself. Because of the relationship between mass and gravity, this means they have an extremely powerful gravitational force. Virtually nothing can escape. Even light is trapped by a black hole.</p><p>A black hole is a dark center of gravity that swallows everything in its path.</p><p><br>Was that the answer?</p><p><i>Am I</i>, I wondered, <i>the proud owner of a pet black hole?</i></p></p><h2>Big Nate: Revenge of the Cream Puffs (Volume 15)</h2><p>It's one, two, three strikes, you're out, as the Cream Puffs seek sweet revenge!<br><br>Here come the Cream Puffs! &nbsp;Nate and his baseball team, saddled with the most embarrassing moniker in Little League history, want to show the world they&#x2019;re not just a bunch of cupcakes.

Over 12,000 helicopters were used in the Vietnam War, which is why it became known as &#34;The Helicopter War&#34;. Almost half of the helicopters, 5,086, were lost. Helicopter pilots and crews accounted for nearly 10 percent of all the US casualties suffered in Vietnam, with nearly 5,000 killed and an untold number of wounded. Lew Jennings flew over 700 Air Cavalry Cobra Gunship Helicopter missions and received Three Distinguished Flying Crosses for Valor. This memoir describes first-hand the harrowing experiences of helicopter pilots and crews in combat operations, from the far South to the DMZ, including the infamous Ashau Valley, Hamburger Hill, LZ Airborne and others.</p><p>Lew Jennings is a retired Army Officer, former airline pilot and business executive.

That was South Korea's Fifth Republic, a military regime that had come to power in a <em>coup d'etat</em>. After the protest-motivated violence against students on other campuses, her parents warned her to stay out of politics. So, she joined the Traditional Mask Dance club. But at a time of such danger, even an ancient art form was a political act. The satire of long-dead politicians had as many parallels to the politics of the day as Shakespeare does now. And the troupe found themselves performing at protests, and using their drums to stir up the crowds. And that was not the end.</p> <p>It was at one of these protests that the handsome young editor of the school newspaper invited her to a book club that he leads. As a student of Western Literature, she expected to pop into the cafeteria to talk about <strong>Moby Dick</strong>, <strong>Hamlet</strong>, and <strong>The Scarlet Letter</strong>. But instead, she found herself hiding in a basement as the youngest member of an underground, illegal, banned book club. It's the 100% true, autobiographical story of a time of authoritarianism, turmoil, torture, and defiance in last century's South Korea.</p></p><p>This is Hyun Sook&#39;s first book, and for now, she&#39;s very shy about doing interviews or public speaking, as English is her second language.

Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology.

We are so often encouraged to resist our rage or punished for justifiably expressing it, yet how many remarkable achievements would never have gotten off the ground without the kernel of anger that fueled them? Approached with conscious intention, anger is a vital instrument, a radar for injustice and a catalyst for change.

Photos show glamorous women in long evening gowns and smiling men in carefully tailored black tie standing, in glittering groups, around a cake that covered the expanse of a five-foot square table.<br> <br>Among the most prized gifts my parents received that day was their wedding china. These white-and-gold plates were more than an expensive gesture: they were an important symbol of adulthood and their community&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s approval of marriage in general and of this marriage in particular. For my mother, they represented a core aspect of her identity: that of being a woman, soon to be mother, the nurturer of her family. Growing up, these look-but-don&#x2019;t-touch dishes were at the top of a hierarchy of plates that my mother established. When my siblings and I were small, we used them only on the rarest and most special occasions and always with great care.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why, one day when I was fifteen, I was dumbfounded to see my mother standing on the long veranda outside our kitchen, chucking one china plate after another as far and as hard as she could into the hot, humid air. Our kitchen was on the second floor of a house that sat perched at the top of a long, rolling hill. I watched each dish soar through the atmosphere, its weight generating a sharp, steady trajectory before shattering into pieces on the terrace far below.<br> <br>While the image is vivid in my mind, I have no memory of any sound. What I remember most was that there was no noise at all as my mother methodically threw one, then another, then another, over and over until her hands were finally free. She didn&#x2019;t utter a sound the entire time. I have no idea if she even knew anyone was watching. When she was done, she walked back into the kitchen and asked me how my school day had gone, as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened. I desperately wanted to know what I had witnessed, but it didn&#x2019;t feel like a good time to ask questions, so I sat and worked on my homework as my mother prepared dinner and the day morphed into night. We never talked about anger.<br> <br>Why do we so rarely learn how to be angry?<br> <br>Like most of us, I learned about anger in a vacuum of information, by watching the people around me: what they did with their anger, how they responded to other people when they were mad. I don&#x2019;t remember my parents or other adults ever talking to me about anger directly. Sadness, yes. Envy, anxiety, guilt, check, check, check. But not anger. It turns out that, for girls, this is par for the course. While parents talk to girls about emotions more than they do to boys, anger is excluded. Reflect with me for a moment: How did you first learn to think about emotions, and anger in particular? Can you remember having any conversations with authority figures or role models about how to think about your anger or what to do with it? If you are a woman, chances are the answer is no.<br> <br>As far as my own early understanding of anger, the plate-throwing incident said it all. My mother may have been livid, but she gave every appearance of being cheerful and happy. By staying silent and choosing this particular outlet for her feelings, she communicated a trove of information: for example, that anger was experienced in isolation and was not worth sharing verbally with others. That furious feelings are best kept to oneself. That when they do inevitably come out, the results can be scary, shocking, and destructive.<br> <br>My mother was acting in a way that remains typical for many women: she was getting her anger &#x201c;out,&#x201d; but in a way that explicitly separated it from her relationships. Most women report feeling the angriest in private and interpersonal settings. They also prioritize their relationships&#x2014;at home, work, and even in political contexts&#x2014;in determining, consciously or not, if and how to express negative emotions.<br> <br>Throwing plates is an example of a coping mechanism, but it is not an effective or healthy way to express anger. Coping often involves self-silencing and feelings of powerlessness. Getting anger out in this way is not the same as envisioning anger as a transitional tool that helps you to change the world around you. Plate throwing did, however, allow my mother to be angry without seeming angry. In this way, it allowed her to be a &#x201c;good&#x201d; woman, which, significantly, meant not being demanding, loud, or expressing her own needs. Even though this episode happened more than thirty-five years ago, it remains true that social norms continue to dictate how we think and feel about emotions, especially when it comes to women and anger.<br> <br>But first, what happens when we experience anger? Feeling anger involves a constellation of factors, including physiology, genetics, and cognitive processing. These make up the character of anger. For example, you might be a person who tends to get angry quickly, known as &#x201c;trait anger&#x201d;; or you might be slower to anger and experience it mainly when provoked. That is called &#x201c;state anger.&#x201d; Context is equally critical, however. Our responses to provocation, our assessments, and our judgments always involve a back-and-forth between character and context. Where you are and who you may be angry with, as well as the broader social construction of anger (part of what&#x2019;s called an &#x201c;emotional culture&#x201d;) matter.<br> <br>While we experience anger internally, it is mediated culturally and externally by other people&#x2019;s expectations and social prohibitions. Roles and responsibilities, power and privilege are the framers of our anger. Relationships, culture, social status, exposure to discrimination, poverty, and access to power all factor into how we think about, experience, and utilize anger. Different countries, regions&#x2014;even neighboring communities in the same state&#x2014;have been shown to have anger profiles, exhibiting different patterns of behavior and social dynamics. So, for example, in some cultures anger is a way to vent frustration, but in others it is more for exerting authority. In the United States, anger in white men is often portrayed as justifiable and patriotic, but in black men, as criminality; and in black women, as threat. In the Western world, which this book focuses on, anger in women has been widely associated with &#x201c;madness.&#x201d;<br> <br>Anger is also not unidirectional but part of endless mental, physical, and intellectual feedback loops that operate below our conscious understanding. It is sometimes called a &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; emotion&#x2014;resulting from other, often hidden, feelings of shame or fear. You might not always identify anger as part of what may be causing you discomfort, pain, or distress, but chances are that if you look closely, unexpressed or inadequately expressed anger plays a part in what you are experiencing. For some of us, being angry causes anxiety, which, in turn, makes us angrier. For others, anger becomes part of our bodies, causing physical discomfort, which then makes us short tempered, unhappy, and impairs our health. These anger feedback loops often directly implicate unacknowledged social injustice. One of the most common feedback loops that women live with involves anger caused by discrimination that, if denied, intensifies, increasing stress and its effects.<br> <br>Of course, everyone feels anger. Studies show that differences between men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s experiences of feeling angry are virtually nonexistent. Where there is a difference, they defy stereotypes about men being the so-called angry sex. For a variety of reasons, which we will explore, women report feeling anger more frequently, more intensely, and for longer periods of time than men do. Most episodes involving anger do not involve physical interactions but verbal ones, and women are more likely than men to use angry and aggressive language. Additionally, men more frequently associate feeling powerful with experiencing anger, but women, notably, associate powerlessness with their anger.<br> <br>If everyone feels anger, why focus on women? Why does gender matter?<br> <br>Because while women and men feel anger similarly, there are stark differences in how we respond to those feelings and how they are received by the people around us. Men and women also tend to have different physiological responses to anger-stimulating provocation. Gender-role expectations, often overlapping with racial-role expectations, dictate the degree to which we can use anger effectively in personal contexts and to participate in civic and political life. Despite differences, women&#x2019;s responses are routinely ignored in public discussion, in analyses of anger dynamics, and in many proposed &#x201c;anger management&#x201d; solutions.<br> <br>Binary gender schemas are being challenged and dismantled every day, but they still profoundly govern our lives. Gender schemas&#x2014;organizing generalizations that we learn early in life&#x2014;simplify the world around us, but they also reproduce problematic discrimination. Male and female categories assigned at birth immediately form the basis, in our families, for how we assign roles, attributes, responsibilities, and status. They determine just as powerfully how we experience our feelings, as well as how they are perceived and responded to by others.<br> <br>At home, children still learn quickly that for boys and men, anger reinforces traditional gender expectations, but that for girls and women, anger confounds them. It&#x2019;s as children that most of us learn to regard anger as unfeminine, unattractive, and selfish. Many of us are taught that our anger will be an imposition on others, making us irksome and unlikeable. That it will alienate our loved ones or put off people we want to attract. That it will twist our faces, make us ugly. This is true even for those of us who have to use anger to defend ourselves in charged and dangerous situations. As girls, we are not taught to acknowledge or manage our anger so much as fear, ignore, hide, and transform it.<br> <br>On the other hand, anger and masculinity are powerfully enmeshed and reinforce one another. In boys and men, anger has to be controlled, but it is often seen as a virtue, especially when it is used to protect, defend, or lead. Anger is thought of in terms of disruption, loudness, authority, vulgarity, and physical aggression and domination, and couched in terms of violence and clich�s of masculinity. Boys learn early on about anger, but far less about other feelings, which handicaps them&#x2014;and society&#x2014;in different ways. Socially discouraged from seeming feminine (in other words, being empathetic, vulnerable, and compassionate), their emotional alternatives often come down to withdrawal or aggressive expressions of anger.<br> <br>As we move from our families to our communities, we become engaged in systems that distribute not only resources and cultural capital but also emotional expression. Gender combines with race, class, age, and other aspects of our identities and social status to alter how we behave and are treated.<br> <br>There is not a woman alive who does not understand that women&#x2019;s anger is openly reviled. We don&#x2019;t need books, studies, theories, or specialists to tell us this. During the past several years, I&#x2019;ve spoken to thousands of girls and women at schools, conferences, and corporations. Without fail, afterward they come up to me to say the same two things: they want to know how to stand up for themselves &#x201c;without sounding angry or bitter,&#x201d; and they want to share stories about how, when they do express anger about issues specifically relevant to their lives as women, people respond with doubt and often aggression.<br> <br>Women experience discrimination differently, but we share the experience&#x2014;in anger or merely when simply speaking assertively&#x2014;of being told we are &#x201c;crazy,&#x201d; &#x201c;irrational,&#x201d; even &#x201c;demonic.&#x201d; If we are worried, and, as studies show, compelled to repackage, ignore, divert, or trivialize our anger, it is because we well understand the costs of displaying it. Our society is infinitely creative in finding ways to dismiss and pathologize women&#x2019;s rage. I have always understood that being seen as an &#x201c;angry woman&#x201d;&#x2014;sometimes simply for sharing my thoughts out loud&#x2014;would cast me as overemotional, irrational, &#x201c;passionate,&#x201d; maybe hysterical, and certainly a &#x201c;not-objective&#x201d; and fuzzy thinker.<br> <br>When a woman shows anger in institutional, political, and professional settings, she automatically violates gender norms. She is met with aversion, perceived as more hostile, irritable, less competent, and unlikeable&#x2014;the kiss of death for a class of people expected to maintain social connections. The same people who might opt to work for an angry-sounding, aggressive man are likely to be less tolerant of the same behavior if the boss were a woman. When a man becomes angry in an argument or debate, people are more likely to abandon their own positions and defer to his. But when a woman acts the same way, she&#x2019;s likely to elicit the opposite response. For some of us, considered angry by nature and default, the risks of asserting ourselves, defending ourselves, or speaking out in support of issues that are important to us can be significant. Black girls and women, for example, routinely silenced by &#x201c;Angry Black Woman&#x201d; stereotypes have to contend with abiding dangers of institutionalized violence that might result from their expressing justifiable rage. The fact that men, as studies find, consider anger power enhancing in a way that women don&#x2019;t, makes sense because for men, anger is far more likely to be power enhancing.<br> <br>The lessons are subtle and consistent. We go from being &#x201c;cute princesses,&#x201d; to &#x201c;drama queens,&#x201d; to &#x201c;high-maintenance bitches.&#x201d; Girls who object to unfairness or injustice are often teased and taunted. Adult women are described as oversensitive or exaggerating. Representations and responses like these, whether in families or in popular culture, teach us that our anger is not something we or anyone else should take seriously. Women come to expect and dread mockery and ridicule as likely responses to their anger. This persistent denial of subjectivity, knowledge, and reasonable concerns&#x2014;commonly known as gaslighting&#x2014;is deeply harmful and often abusive. Women&#x2019;s anticipation of negative responses is why so many women remain silent about what they need, want, and feel, and why so many men can easily choose ignorance and dominance over intimacy.<br> <br>Women&#x2019;s anger is usually disparaged in virtually all arenas, except those in which anger confirms gender-role stereotypes about women as nurturers and reproductive agents. This means we are allowed to be angry but not on our own behalves. If a woman is angry in her &#x201c;place,&#x201d; as a mother or a teacher, for example, she is respected, and her anger is generally understood and acceptable. If, however, she transgresses and is angry in what is thought of as a men&#x2019;s arena&#x2014;such as traditional politics or the workplace&#x2014;she is almost always penalized in some way.<br> <br>Women aren&#x2019;t somehow magically protected from these ideas and social norms. We frequently internalize them, seeing our anger as incompatible with our primary designated roles as caretakers. Even the incipient suggestion of anger&#x2014;in themselves or in other women&#x2014;makes some women profoundly uncomfortable. In an effort not to seem angry, we ruminate. We go out of our way to look &#x201c;rational&#x201d; and &#x201c;calm.&#x201d; We minimize our anger, calling it frustration, impatience, exasperation, or irr...</p><h2>Unsinkable (Titanic, No. 1)</h2><p>The ultimate action/adventure trilogy begins, with #1 bestselling author Gordon Korman plunging readers into the heart of the Titanic.<br><br>The Titanic is meant to be unsinkable, but as it begins its maiden voyage, there's plenty of danger waiting for four of its young passengers.

In short, the Maverick Era saw<b> the creation of the modern Formula 1 car</b>.<br><br> This is also the time when<b> legendary names </b>who defined F1 were out in full force: Jim Clark, Jack Brabham, Dan Gurney, Sir Jackie Stewart, Graham Hill, Niki Lauda, James Hunt, Bruce McLaren, Jody Scheckter.<b> We'll see and meet all of them</b>. But <i>F1 Mavericks</i>&nbsp;also focuses on the maverick&nbsp;<b>designers and engineers</b> behind the cars--men like Colin Chapman, Mauro Forghieri, Sir Patrick Head, Maurice Philippe, Gordon Murray, Robin Herd and many others. We'll hear directly from many of them, including a foreword from 1978 F1 World Champion, Mario Andretti and afterword from the late three-time champion Niki Lauda.<br><br> Every chapter is a&nbsp;<b>photographic account&nbsp;of important races</b> throughout the period,&nbsp;supplemented with sidebars featuring key designers and technologies, like&nbsp;wings, ground effect, slick tires, turbochargers, and the Brabham "fan" suction car.&nbsp;<i>F1 Mavericks</i> is&nbsp;an international story, and includes<b>&nbsp;</b>designs&nbsp;from<b> </b>Japan (Honda), Britain (McLaren, Tyrrell, Cooper, BRM) Italy (Ferrari, Maserati, Alfa Romeo), France (Matra, Ligier, Renault), Germany (Porsche, BMW) and the United States (Eagle, Shadow, Penske, Parnelli).<br><br> Strap yourself in for the&nbsp;story of the greatest era in Formula 1 racing--it's all here in&nbsp;<i>F1 Mavericks</i>.</p><p>The late&nbsp;<b>Pete Biro</b> began photographing motorsports in the 1950s, contributing to magazines such as <i>Road &amp; Track </i>and <i>Car and Driver</i>. As his career progressed, his work found greater fame on the pages of&nbsp;<i>Time</i>, <i>LIFE&nbsp;</i>and <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. &nbsp;<br>Author<b> George Levy </b>is a longtime motorsports journalist and historian. The former <i>Autoweek</i> editor&nbsp;sits on the board of the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America.

His professional career spanned more than four decades and includes victories in the Indy 500 (1969) and Daytona 500 (1967), and championships in F1 (1978) and CART/USAC open-wheel racing.<br>The late <b>Niki Lauda</b> was administered last rites after a crash in the 1976 German Grand Prix, then came back to the cockpit six weeks later. He won three titles in all (1975, '77, '84). Andretti and Lauda are famous for never holding back when talking about the sport they love."...a ride that&#x2019;s fast, accurate, and entertaining."<b><i> - LACar.com</i></b><br><br><p><i>"F1 MAVERICKS&nbsp;</i>is a book to savor page by page."</p><b><i> - SpeedReaders.info</i></b><br><br>"The book&#x2019;s afterword by the late champion Niki Lauda, which offers a blistering take on the current state of F1, is alone worth the price of admission."<b><i> - Classic Motorsports</i></b></p><h2>Improvise for Real: The Complete Method for All Instruments</h2><p><p>Improvise for Real is a step-by-step method that teaches you to improvise your own music through progressive exercises that anyone can do. You'll learn to understand the sounds in the music all around you. And you'll learn to express your own musical ideas exactly as you hear them in your mind.</p><p>The method starts with very simple creative exercises that you can begin right away. As you progress, the method leads you on a guided tour through the entire world of modern harmony. You will be improvising your own original melodies from the very first day, and your knowledge will expand with each practice session as you explore and discover our musical system for yourself.</p><p>Improvise for Real brings together creativity, ear training, music theory and physical technique into a single creative daily practice that will show you the entire path to improvisation mastery. You will learn to understand the sounds in the music all around you and to improvise with confidence over jazz standards, blues songs, pop music or any other style you would like to play. And you'll be jamming, enjoying yourself and creating your own music every step of the way.</p><p>The method is open to all instruments and ability levels. The exercises are easy to understand and fun to practice. There is no sight reading required, and you don't need to know anything about music theory to begin. Already being used by both students and teachers in more than 20 countries, Improvise for Real is now considered by many people to be the definitive system for learning to improvise. If you have always dreamed of truly understanding music and being able to improvise with complete freedom on your instrument, this is the book for you!</p></p><p><p>David Reed's mission is to teach all people how to connect with their own musical creativity and enjoy improvising and composing their own music. While his own musical background is primarily in jazz music, his approach to teaching improvisation is universal and applies to all styles of music.</p> <p>During his early years of teaching musical improvisation for all instruments, David became increasingly frustrated with the clich�s and formulas that are commonly taught in improvisation courses. He felt that these rules and formulas were forcing students into a very superficial relationship with improvising, and this often caused them more harm than good.</p> <p>He began to imagine a different kind of improvisation method that would enable students to explore and discover the beautiful world of modern harmony for themselves. For more than 10 years David worked to develop a complete method that would give musicians this direct, personal experience with each sound in our musical system, taking students directly to the same understanding of harmony that is enjoyed by every great improviser.</p> <p>The method is called Improvise for Real (IFR), and it is fast on its way to becoming the definitive system for learning to improvise. It is now being used by both students and teachers in more than 20 countries. David also provides jam tracks and other learning materials to support the entire IFR community. You can learn more at www.ImproviseForReal.com.</p> <p>David is currently located in Andorra. His primary instrument is the nylon string guitar. He also enjoys playing both the trumpet and the piano. A musician for more than 30 years, his unique perspective on music and creativity is based on his experiences playing and teaching music in Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Nicaragua and the United States.</p></p><h2>Reality transurfing. Steps I-V</h2><p>Transurfing is a powerful tool for managing reality. Apply it and life will begin to change according to YOUR order. When you use Transurfing goals are not reached, so much as realised for the most part of themselves. It seems impossible to believe but only at first. The ideas presented in the book have already received practical confirmation. Those who have tried Transurfing, experience surprise bordering on delight as the world of the Transurfer inexplicably changes before their very eyes.What is the book about?Transurfing is the art of controlling reality using our freedom of choice. The world always reflects our perception of it. People can choose any variant of the development of current reality and thereby find themselves in circumstances they find desirable . To learn how to do this, you have to learn how to establish mutual understanding between the soul and mind, formulate intention and avoid the influence of destructive pendulums.Why should you read this book?Most people who have read "Transurfing", note that from the very e first pages, the book completely reverses their view of the world and the role of the individual in their own life. A fresh look at reality encourages the reader to consciously relate to the choices they make in any moment, and this really changes their life in the direction they would like. "It works!" is the phrase found in almost all reviews of Vadim Zeland's book.Who is this book for?The book has aroused great interest among the young and middle-aged, those who are interested equally in philosophy, psychology and physics and the mysteries of human consciousness.Why we decided to publish itThe idea of " Transurfing Reality" quickly gained popularity when the author posted the text on the Internet. Numerous readers' reviews, saying that it really works, and the author's original take on the structure of reality prompted the publishers decide to publish Vadim Zeland's manuscript. We had no doubt that "Transurfing" would be popular among a huge audienceAbout the authorVadim Zeland: "I'm over forty. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union I was engaged in research in the field of quantum physics, then computer technology, and now books. I live in Russia. My nationality is Russian, or more precisely, a quarter Estonian. The rest is irrelevant, as is all the above. Regarding my own success, all I can say is that Transurfing works perfectly. I don&#x2019;t however want to advertise my personal life, as then it would cease to be personal. Fame turns against you, if you give in to temptation and climb up on a pedestal for all to see. Among some people, the American Indians, for example ,there is a belief that if someone copies your portrait (photographs you), they steal part of your soul. Of course, this is just superstition, but tthere is no smoke without fire. You can distribute a product of personal creativity ; but release your personality for mass circulation &#x2013; never.To the question of intrigued readers: "Who are you, Vadim Zeland?", I usually just say: "Nobody". My biography can not and should not be a matter of interest, since I am not thecreator of Transurfing, only a "retranslator". It is essential that we be nothing - an empty vessel, so that we do not impose our personal distortions onto this ancient Knowledge, that opens the door to a world, where the impossible becomes possible. Reality ceases to exist as something external and independent. and becomes manageable if you follow certain rules. The secret itself that is hidden only in as much as it lies on the surface, is so great that the personality of its bearer ceases to be relevant. Perhaps the guardians who passed on this knowledge to me are of genuine interest but they too prefer to remain in the wings."Translation from the Russian language by Joanna Dobson</p><p></p><h2>Molly&#39;s Game [Movie Tie-in]: The True Story of the 26-Year-Old Woman Behind the Most Exclusive, High-Stakes Underground Poker Game in the World</h2><p><p><strong>Now a major motion picture, written and directed by Aaron Sorkin and starring Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, and Michael Cera&#x2014;the true story of "Hollywood&#x2019;s poker princess" who gambled everything, won big, then lost it all.</strong></p><p>When Molly Bloom was a little girl in a small Colorado town, she dreamed of a life without rules and limits, a life where she didn&#x2019;t have to measure up to anyone or anything&#x2014;where she could become whatever she wanted.</p><p>She ultimately got more than she could have ever bargained for. </p><p>In <em>Molly&#x2019;s Game</em>, she takes you through her adventures running an exclusive high-stakes private poker game catering to such clients as Hollywood royalty like Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Affleck, athletes, billionaires, politicians, and financial titans.

Since identifying and uncovering demons by name is so important in deliverance, the idea to write a thesaurus is well overdue. Some argue that we don&#39;t need to know the specific names of demons. After all, what&#39;s in a name?Names are what we use to identify. There is power in identification. Identifying the enemy is a key to casting him out. The more believers can identify the enemy by name, the more successful they will be in driving the enemy out.The names found in this thesaurus are all subject to the name of Jesus. The name of Jesus is the name given above every name! His name, therefore, gives us authority over every demon name.

We all nod like we even have&nbsp; a clue.<br> Eight of the richest men and women in the world stand at the opposite end of the conference room. Last night, I used PJ&#x2019;s phone to look them up. Babel Communications. Swallowed Google back in 2036. Some blogger says they&#x2019;re NASA&#x2019;s dark little shadow and have been for decades. Whatever they do, they look good doing it. Each of them wears the same charcoal suit. It looks like someone threaded smoke into formal wear. The overheads dance off all the polished shoulders and shoes.<br> But the lights and the room and the world are bending forward to hear the man who&#x2019;s speaking: Marcus Defoe. He&#x2019;s black, but not like me. I&#x2019;ve spent half my life feeling like an absence, a moonless night. I can&#x2019;t imagine this guy going anywhere without turning heads. Everything about him whispers <i>king. </i>It&#x2019;s in the set of his shoulders and the&nbsp;sound of his voice and the quiet power of his walk. He glides toward us, and a series of warning signs flash through my head. One glance is enough to know he&#x2019;s the most danger- ous man in the room.<br>Leaning back, I pull one of my earbuds out. My music was playing low-key but the Asian kid next to me keeps looking over like it&#x2019;s&nbsp; the loudest thing he&#x2019;s&nbsp; ever heard. Tough luck. I leave the volume up just to grind at him. When Babel recruited me, they said all of this was a game. I like playing games, but I like <i>winning </i>games even more. The stiff next&nbsp; to me shakes his head in annoyance, and I already feel like I&#x2019;m up a few points on him.<br> The earpiece bleeds half beats and old-soul voices. Peo- ple at school think I like early hip-hop &#x2019;cause it&#x2019;s vintage, but the truth is I could never afford the new stuff. When my neighbor glances over for the thousandth time, I nod and smile like we&#x2019;re going to be best friends.<br> &#x201c;You were chosen to be at the forefront of the most serious space exploration known to mankind. The results of your mission will change the outlook for our species.&#x201d; Defoe goes on to talk about humanity, manifest destiny, and final frontiers. His head is shaved and perfectly round. His smile is blinding. His eyes are so stunningly blue&nbsp; that the girls at school would call them the color of boom. Babel&#x2019;s king has a single imperfection: His right hand is withered, like&nbsp; a giant took its sweet time breaking each and every bone. It&#x2019;s the kind of injury you&#x2019;re not supposed to look at, but always do. &#x201c;The reward for your efforts will be beyond your imagination. A trust fund has already been established &nbsp;for&nbsp;each of you. A check for fifty thousand dollars will be put into your account every month for the rest of your lives.&#x201d;<br>Everyone at the table perks up. Straighter shoulders, wider eyes, less fidgeting. We all react to the numbers because we all must be dead-dancin&#x2019; broke. Except one kid.<br> He looks bored. King Solomon just tossed us the keys to the kingdom, and he&#x2019;s hiding yawns? I take a closer look. He&#x2019;s white. I fact-check the table and realize he&#x2019;s the only white boy here. American? Maybe. Could be European. He&#x2019;s sporting a plain three-button shirt. He drums his fingers distractedly on the table, and I spot a tag under one armpit. So the shirt&#x2019;s a recent purchase. His hair looks deliberately imperfect, like he wanted to seem more down-to-earth. When he glances my way, I set both eyes back on Defoe again.<br> &#x201c;Beyond monetary stability, we are also offering our medical plans for your families. They now have free access to health care, counseling, surgery, and the <i>most </i>advanced treatments for cancer and other terminal diseases. Those services come without a price tag, and they&#x2019;re offered in perpetuity.&#x201d;<br> I don&#x2019;t know what <i>perpetuity </i>means, but some of the kids around the table are nodding wisely. Two of them flinched at the word <i>cancer. </i>One&#x2019;s a girl with blond hair, blue eyes, and enough makeup to place in a pageant. I spy a strand&nbsp; of pink-dyed hair tucked behind one ear. The other kid is really tan with bright brown eyes. Middle Eastern&#x2019;s my guess. I wonder if their parents have cancer. I wonder if that&#x2019;s how Babel roped&nbsp; them into this monkey-in-space routine. I wonder if they noticed me flinch right around the same time they did.<br>It&#x2019;s hard to hear the words that follow, because an image of Moms has snagged my attention. Those bird-thin wrists circled by medical bracelets. We spent enough time in the ICU that the hospital started feeling like a prison. Only difference is that some diseases don&#x2019;t grant parole.<br> &#x201c;. . . we offer stock options with our company, internal connections with any business in the world, and an opportunity to put your name in the history of the human race. Desmond is passing out a gag order. If you&#x2019;re still interested, just sign on the dotted line.&#x201d;<br> One of the lesser suits makes the rounds. He sets hot-off-the-presses forms in front of each of us. I can&#x2019;t stop staring at the massive gold watch on his wrist. In less-promising circumstances, I&#x2019;d whoops my way out of my chair, slip it off his wrist, and stranger my way out of the room before he knew which way was west. But life is good, so I carefully skim a paragraph with words like <i>privatization </i>and <i>extrajudicial. </i>On my left, the Asian kid considers a strange gathering of symbols. The girl on my right&#x2019;s reading something that looks a little beyond the reach of my high school Spanish. I almost laugh, thinking we&#x2019;re the politically correct version of the <i>Justice Squad. </i>But if Babel&#x2019;s looking for heroes, they picked the wrong guy.<br> I sign on the dotted line and try to look like I didn&#x2019;t just win the lottery.<br> The suits whisper million-dollar secrets. Defoe prowls a casual, predatory circle to make sure we&#x2019;re all being good little boys and girls. I hit next on my shuffle and a nice&nbsp;unfiltered beat drops. Two voices duet their way to a bare-bones chorus. They trade lyrics until it feels like I&#x2019;m back in the concrete jungle, ciphering and laughing with the Most Excellent Brothers.I miss the boys already, especially PJ. Our neighborhood&#x2019;s pretty full of dead ends, though, and Babel&#x2019;s offering a way out. I don&#x2019;t know what their offer means to the other kids around the table, but to me it means Moms getting her name at the top of the transplant lists. It means Pops not working night shifts. It means three meals a day and more than one pair of jeans.<br> To me, this is&nbsp; everything.</p><h2>Poil�ne: The Secrets of the World-Famous Bread Bakery</h2><p><b><i>Epicurious</i>' "New Fall 2019 Cookbooks We Can't Wait to Cook From</b><b>"<br><i>Food &amp; Wine</i> 18 Essential New Cookbooks for Fall<br> Amazon's pick for Biggest Cookbooks of Fall<br><i>Chowhound</i>'s Best New Cookbooks and Best New Baking Cookbooks for Fall 2019<br> "In many ways, the good bread we have now in the United States exists thanks to Poil�ne.

The only geologic hazard Washingtonians need not fear, at least not with the continued trend of global warming, is another Ice Age flood. More than forty of the biggest floods known in the history of Earth scoured the Channeled Scabland of eastern Washington, the most recent only about 15,000 years ago. <br>Since the first edition of Roadside Geology of Washington appeared on the book shelves in 1984, several generations of geologists have studied the wild assortment of rocks in the Evergreen State, from 45-million-year-old sandstone exposed in sea cliffs at Cape Flattery to 1.4-billion-year-old sandstone near Spokane. In between are the rugged granitic and metamorphic peaks of the North Cascades, the volcanic flows of Mt. Rainier and the other active volcanoes of the Cascade magmatic arc, and the 2-mile-thick flood basalts of the Columbia Basin. With the help of this brand new, completely updated second edition, you can appreciate spectacular geologic features along more than forty of Washington's highways.</p><p>Marli B.

Day by day throughout the year, readers will see the beauty of Christ in fresh new ways, creating a deeper understanding and appreciation for who Jesus is and what he accomplished through his Cross and Resurrection.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.&#x201d; <b>Luke 24:27</b> <br>Wouldn&#x2019;t you have loved to be part of that conversation with Jesus? As he walked with two of his followers on the road to Emmaus, what Scriptures did he point to and say, &#x201c;This is about me&#x201d;? Which events, symbols, and people did he identify as foreshadowing his life, death, and resurrection? <br>The entire Old Testament tells a story that only finds its completion in Jesus Christ. In <i>The One Year Book of Discovering Jesus in the Old Testament,</i> Bible teacher Nancy Guthrie takes readers from Genesis through Malachi, shining the light on how the Old Testament points to Christ: he&#x2019;s the offspring of Eve who put an end to the curse of sin; he&#x2019;s the Son offered up as a sacrifice by his father; he is the true Temple where people can meet with God; he is the Suffering Servant Isaiah wrote about and the King whose throne will last forever&#x2015;and so much more. Day by day throughout the year, readers will see the beauty of Christ in fresh, new ways, creating a deeper understanding and appreciation for who Jesus is, what he accomplished, and what is ahead for all who love him.</p><h2>Berserk, Vol. 11</h2><p>The Band of the Hawk &#x2014; what's left of them &#x2014; are on the run, Guts and Casca having rescued the Hawks' leader, Griffith, from the horrors of the King of Midland's dungeons.

A brilliant young boy, Andrew "Ender" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut&#x2015;young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.</p><p>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. </p><p>Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.</p><p><i><b>Speaker for the Dead</b></i></p><p>In the aftermath of his terrible war, Ender Wiggin disappeared, and a powerful voice arose: The Speaker for the Dead, who told the true story of the Bugger War.</p><p>Now, long years later, a second alien race has been discovered, but again the aliens' ways are strange and frightening...again, humans die. And it is only the Speaker for the Dead, who is also Ender Wiggin the Xenocide, who has the courage to confront the mystery...and the truth.</p><p><i><b>Xenocide</b></i></p><p>The war for survival of the planet Lusitania will be fought in the hearts of a child named Gloriously Bright.</p><p>On Lusitania, Ender found a world where humans and Pequeninos and the Hive Queen could all live together; where three very different intelligent species could find common ground at last. Or so he thought.</p><p>Lusitania also harbors the descolada, a virus that kills all humans it infects, but which the Pequeninos require in order to become adults. The Starways Congress so fears the effects of the descolada, should it escape from Lusitania, that they have ordered the destruction of the entire planet, and all who live there. The Fleet is on its way, a second xenocide seems inevitable.</p><p><i><b>Children of the Mind</b></i></p><p>The planet Lusitania is home to three sentient species: the Pequeninos; a large colony of humans; and the Hive Queen, brought there by Ender. But once against the human race has grown fearful; the Starways Congress has gathered a fleet to destroy Lusitania.</p><p>Jane, the evolved computer intelligence, can save the three sentient races of Lusitania. She has learned how to move ships outside the universe, and then instantly back to a different world, abolishing the light-speed limit. But it takes all the processing power available to her, and the Starways Congress is shutting down the Net, world by world.</p><p>Soon Jane will not be able to move the ships. Ender's children must save her if they are to save themselves.</p></p><p><p><b>Orson Scott Card</b> is best known for his science fiction novel <i>Ender's Game</i> and it's many sequels that expand the Ender Universe into the far future and the near past. Those books are organized into the Ender Quintet, the five books that chronicle the life of Ender Wiggin; the Shadow Series, that follows on the novel <i>Ender's Shadow</i> and are set on Earth; and the Formic Wars series, written with co-author Aaron Johnston, that tells of the terrible first contact between humans and the alien "Buggers".</p><p>Card has been a working writer since the 1970s. Beginning with dozens of plays and musical comedies produced in the 1960s and 70s, Card's first published fiction appeared in 1977--the short story "Gert Fram" in the July issue of <i>The Ensign</i>, and the novelette version of "Ender's Game" in the August issue of <i>Analog</i>.</p><p>The novel-length version of <i>Ender's Game</i>, published in 1984 and continuously in print since then, became the basis of the 2013 film, starring Asa Butterfield, Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley, Hailee Steinfeld, Viola Davis, and Abigail Breslin.</p><p>Card was born in Washington state, and grew up in California, Arizona, and Utah. He served a mission for the LDS Church in Brazil in the early 1970s. Besides his writing, he runs occasional writers' workshops and directs plays. He frequently teaches writing and literature courses at Southern Virginia University.</p><p>He is the author many sf and fantasy novels, including the American frontier fantasy series "The Tales of Alvin Maker" (beginning with <i>Seventh Son</i>), There are also stand-alone science fiction and fantasy novels like <i>Pastwatch</i> and <i>Hart's Hope</i>. He has collaborated with his daughter Emily Card on a manga series, Laddertop. He has also written contemporary thrillers like <i>Empire</i> and historical novels like the monumental <i>Saints</i> and the religious novels <i>Sarah</i> and <i>Rachel</i> and <i>Leah</i>. Card's recent work includes the Mithermages books (<i>Lost Gate</i>, <i>Gate Thief</i>), contemporary magical fantasy for readers both young and old. </p><p>Card lives in Greensboro, North Carolina, with his wife, Kristine Allen Card, He and Kristine are the parents of five children and several grandchildren.</p><p>&#x201c;Card's prose is powerful here, as is his consideration of mystical and quasi-religious themes. Though billed as the final Ender novel, this story leaves enough mysteries unexplored to justify another entry; and Card fans should find that possibility, like this novel, very welcome indeed.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review) on Children of the Mind</i></p><p>&#x201c;Orson Scott Card made a strong case for being the best writer science fiction has to offer.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Houston Post on Xenocide</i></p><p>&#x201c;There aren't too many recent sf novels we can confidently call truly moral works, but <i>Speaker for the Dead</i> is one.

But instead, I laughed and told myself I&#x2019;d been saved from working with a man who spent more on hair products than I did.</p><p>I went to have coffee with my best friend, Susan, whom I have known since we met in summer camp at age eight. She is intensely loyal, fiercely critical, and relentlessly blunt.</p><p>&#x201c;You must be miserable,&#x201d; she said when I outlined my day.</p><p>&#x201c;Not really. I&#x2019;m trying to be positive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How can you be positive about a dead car?&#x201d;</p><p>I took a deep breath. I could do this. &#x201c;The car was fourteen years old and had 150,000 miles on it. I never expected it to last this long. More important was that I have a nice neighbor who came to help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, that was good,&#x201d; Susan admitted. &#x201c;How about getting soaked on the sidewalk?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look at the funny side. The idiot CEO complimented my skirt. And think how lucky I am that I could buy a new outfit without breaking the bank. &#x201c;</p><p>Susan dumped two packets of Splenda into her coffee and stirred furiously. For years she&#x2019;d heard me gripe about needing more money, so this appreciating what I had was a switch.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m your best friend. You can bitch and complain all you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel like complaining,&#x201d; I said, surprising myself as much as her. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t change what happened, so it feels good to change how I think about it.&#x201d;</p><p>Susan took a long sip of coffee. She has an ambitious, hard-driving nature. Though inordinately successful at work, Susan is often stressed, pressed, and occasionally depressed. Like all of us, she gets so busy concentrating on what she wants that she forgets to be happy for what she has. I worried my good spirits might grate on her. But she just raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&#x201c;If this is that gratitude stuff you&#x2019;ve been working on, I think I need it. How do I sign up?&#x201d;</p><p>It was time to share my secret. So on the top of a napkin, I wrote the heading <i>Three Reasons I&#x2019;m Grateful Today.</i> Then I pushed the napkin across the table and handed Susan a pen.</p><p>&#x201c;Fill it in,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Susan stared at the napkin for so long that I finally took it back and crossed out <i>Three Reasons</i> and changed it to <i>One Reason.</i></p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start easy,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>That was exactly what I had done a few months earlier. I now knew that writing down one thing every day that made me grateful could change my attitude about everything else. A glowing sunset. A good friend&#x2019;s hug. The first hint of spring.</p><p>One thing.</p><p><i>Who can&#x2019;t do that?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>MARRIAGE, LOVE, AND FAMILY</p><p>Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.</p><p>&#x2014;Marcel Proust</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Grateful to be starting my year of living positively</p><p>Happy to learn that gratitude can lower stress, improve sleep, and make me happier</p><p>Lucky to have a pretty journal that I will fill with only good thoughts</p><p>My desire to live gratefully started on New Year&#x2019;s Eve, at a few minutes before midnight, when I stood at a party clutching a glass of champagne with a plastic smile pasted on my face. I knew I should be counting my blessings, but instead, I was counting the minutes until I could leave. My feet hurt from the excessively high-heeled shoes I was wearing and my head throbbed from the loud music that had been blaring all night. I had on a little black dress that was just a little too little, and I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get home and take off the Spanx.</p><p>A TV in a corner of the room blasted <i>New Year&#x2019;s Rockin&#x2019; Eve,</i> and as I watched people carousing in California, whooping it up in Washington, and being boisterous in Boston, I wondered if everybody in the country was having a better time than I was. Or maybe they were just better at faking it.</p><p>In New York, the million or so revelers gathered in Times Square let out a huge roar as the ball began to drop. Since it was twenty degrees outside and they had been corralled in metal pens all day with no porta-potties nearby, I understood why they were eager for midnight. Ringing in the New Year would be a great relief, in every way.</p><p>The Waterford ball finished its descent and the LED lights flashed the new date amid much horn blowing and confetti flying.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Happy New Year!&#x201d;</i></p><p>My husband, Ron, gave me a brief smooch and we clinked glasses.</p><p>Now that the anticipation was over, nobody seemed quite sure what to do. The TV showed an instant replay of the ball dropping, as if it were a moon landing or the final touchdown at the Super Bowl. Standing near the bar, I saw a woman pouring herself another glass of champagne. Her mascara was smudged and tears were streaking down her cheeks.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; I asked her.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said, rubbing her eyes. &#x201c;I hate New Year&#x2019;s. Why pretend anything is going to be different just because a ball dropped? Midnight came without any glass slipper to turn me into a princess.&#x201d;</p><p>I decided not to discuss the subtler points of Cinderella at midnight (that&#x2019;s when she <i>dropped </i>the glass slipper and <i>stopped</i> being a princess, my friend) and hurried away. But her question lingered in the air. What <i>would </i>be different? We celebrate New Year&#x2019;s with high hopes and crazy expectations&#x2014;which may be why a lot of us feel so uncomfortable. (The Spanx don&#x2019;t help either.) But she was right that life wasn&#x2019;t going to improve just because the calendar flipped.</p><p>Objectively, I knew my life was good&#x2014;I had two terrific sons and a handsome husband, an interesting career and close friends. But like many people, I often focused on the negatives of life instead of the pleasures. The last twelve months had been perfectly okay, but nothing thrilling enough to make me want to put on a funny hat and dance in the street. I tried to picture myself back in this spot next year. What would make me feel happier the next time the ball dropped than I did right now? I supposed in the coming months I might win the lottery, move to a Hawaiian paradise, or write a bestseller. But would any of that really work? I could already hear myself grumble that I had to pay huge taxes on the winnings, the sun on Maui was too hot, and six weeks on the<i> New York Times</i> list wasn&#x2019;t enough.</p><p>If the coming year was like most, some good things would happen and some not so good. I had recently overseen a big national survey on gratitude and been on the <i>Today </i>show to talk about it. The survey had started me thinking and researching a lot about positive attitudes. So I knew that how I felt about the twelve months ahead would probably have less to do with what actually happened than with the mood, spirit, and attitude I brought to each day. It wasn&#x2019;t the circumstances that mattered but how I responded to them. I could passively wait for the wonderful to occur&#x2014;and still find something wrong. Or I could accept whatever events did come my way and try to appreciate them a little more.</p><p>I went to collect my coat and saw the woman-who-wasn&#x2019;t-Cinderella getting hers, too.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s a good year for you,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you can make it better. That&#x2019;s a really pretty coat, by the way,&#x201d; I said as she pulled on a brown shearling.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s old. I wish I had a new one. Yours is nicer.&#x201d;</p><p>I could have pointed out that mine was equally aged and had a stain on the sleeve, but I stopped myself. What had I just decided about having the right mood, attitude, and spirit? My coat was suddenly a symbol for my whole life&#x2014;if I had it, I should appreciate it. I didn&#x2019;t want to be the Ungrateful Lady.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s warm and cozy,&#x201d; I said brightly, putting my hands into the pockets. Whoops, one finger slid into a hole. But neither holes nor stains nor ratty hem was going to stop me now. If I planned to be happier by next New Year&#x2019;s, I had to start working on my attitude right now.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The next morning, I woke up earlier than planned, the mild winter sunlight streaming in around the pleated shades in our Midtown Manhattan apartment. After many years living in the suburbs, we had moved to the city just a couple of years ago, and I loved our large windows and wide river views. (My grown-up sons joked that we&#x2019;d found the one part of the city that felt like the suburbs.) Weather reports predicted blizzard conditions moving in, and it had already been a snowy and cold winter. But I made myself stop and enjoy the bit of sunshine breaking through the steel-gray skies.</p><p>Hearing a clattering in the kitchen, I threw on jeans and a T-shirt and skipped out to where Ron was making breakfast. It was just the two of us this morning, but he seemed to have enough ingredients spread across the counter to feed the cast and crew of a James Cameron epic. I gave him a little kiss and said good morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think I&#x2019;m ungrateful?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to be grateful for French toast,&#x201d; he said, flipping a piece that was bubbling on the stove. &#x201c;I like making it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I mean it bigger than breakfast. Do you think I appreciate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. life?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, life.&#x201d; He stared into the frying pan, willing it to cook up a little homespun wisdom. &#x201c;You probably don&#x2019;t appreciate what you have as much as you should. You pay too much attention to what&#x2019;s wrong rather than what&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to try to be more grateful from now on,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my plan for the year. I think it will make me happier. Maybe make us both happier.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Worth a try,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>And that was that. Resolution stated and we&#x2019;d see what happened next.</p><p>Ron put the spatula down and bits of hot grease dripped onto the counter. I started to say something, then bit my tongue. If I wanted to begin appreciating rather than complaining, I&#x2019;d better ignore the puddle of butter gathering on the granite and concentrate on the warm smells of cinnamon and vanilla wafting through the room. I closed my eyes and reminded myself how lucky I was to have a husband who got up early to beat the eggs, soak the bread, and fry &#x2019;em all up. Better keep it to myself that I&#x2019;d much prefer plain oatmeal.</p><p>Later that afternoon, I headed over to the grocery store, and as I pushed a cart along, a familiar Joni Mitchell song, &#x201c;Big Yellow Taxi,&#x201d; was playing. I started humming along with the lamenting lyrics about how it always seems that you don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;ve got &#x2019;til it&#x2019;s gone. Music playing in the frozen-food aisle isn&#x2019;t usually life changing, but I took it as a sign that I was on the right course. Hundreds of musicians from Bob Dylan to Counting Crows have recorded Mitchell&#x2019;s song because in any musical style, the message hits a chord. It happens too often that you have something terrific right in front of you but don&#x2019;t realize it until the lover is gone, the moment is past, and the flowers are wilted.</p><p>Standing there holding a container of H�agen-Dazs chocolate gelato, I vowed that I wouldn&#x2019;t wait and mourn what was lost. I would appreciate what I had. I planned to spend the coming year seeing the sunshine instead of the clouds.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>When I got home, I began making my plan for a year of living gratefully. I&#x2019;d spent my career as a journalist, so I immediately thought of gratitude as a project to research and study. I would find one area to focus on each month&#x2014;whether husband, family, friends, or work&#x2014;and become my own social scientist. I wanted to see what happened when I developed an attitude of gratitude. Instead of doing this casually, I&#x2019;d make a full commitment to get as much information as I could and report and record my findings. I&#x2019;d get advice at every turn from experts and psychologists and consult books by philosophers and psychologists and theologians. The Roman philosopher Cicero famously said, <i>Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all others</i>. If that was true, would my year&#x2019;s project also make me more honest, courageous, and generous?</p><p>When I started telling people in the next few days about my plan to appreciate my life more, they nodded knowingly. Many insisted that they, too, wanted to be more thankful and keep a better perspective. But I got the feeling most weren&#x2019;t doing such a good job at it.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure your life is great, but how grateful were you feeling last Tuesday night when you left your office?&#x201d; I asked several people. Each laughed uncomfortably, and one even asked, &#x201c;How did you know about last Tuesday?&#x201d; Since I&#x2019;m not psychic, I knew she&#x2019;d have the same memory if I mentioned Monday. When we think about the big picture, we can make ourselves be grateful. But on a daily basis, a client is irritating, a boss is rude, there&#x2019;s a lice outbreak at our kids&#x2019; school&#x2014;and we get lost in the vexing details.</p><p>I understood the conflict because the survey I had recently done, funded by the John Templeton Foundation, had shown that most of us suffer from a huge gratitude gap. We know we should be grateful, but something holds us back. In the survey, 94 percent of Americans thought people who are grateful are also more fulfilled and lead richer lives. But <i>less than half </i>the people surveyed said they expressed gratitude on any regular basis.</p><p>You don&#x2019;t need to be a math genius to figure out that those numbers don&#x2019;t add up. We understand that there is something that makes us more fulfilled&#x2014;but we don&#x2019;t jump to try it? It&#x2019;s as if there were a magical happiness rock sitting in the middle of a field and half of us didn&#x2019;t even bother to go over and pick it up. I was one of the people running around that field and never getting near the magic stone. I knew it was there. I kept thinking about it. But something always got in the way.</p><p>I might never have focused on gratitude if Barnaby Marsh, a top executive at the John Templeton Foundation, hadn&#x2019;t raised the topic with me a couple of years earlier. We met by chance, sitting next to each other at a charity dinner, and a few months later, he took me out to a very elegant afternoon tea to discuss some of the Big Ideas the foundation funded.

How did you come up with the idea to write such a different type of book compared to the Maze Runner series?</strong></p> <p>A. Well, my good sir, first of all, thanks you for saying that. When I started brainstorming what I wanted to do next, I didn&#x2019;t really think much about The Maze Runner books, or try too specifically to be different. I just wanted an engaging story, something that I&#x2019;d love to write for several books. Two of my favorite movies ended up serving as an inspiration: <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Inception</em>. Readers will see a lot of influence from those stories. In fact, I kept thinking a certain something would happen in <em>The Matrix</em>, and it surprised me when it never did. It happens in my book!</p> <p><strong>Q. Recently, privacy, online security, and online warfare have been featured prominently in the headlines. Did that influence your fiction at all? If not, do you think it&#x2019;s a coincidence that those issues are cropping up right when you were inspired to write this particular book?</strong></p> <p>A. I think everything in the news influences me without my realizing it. It chills me to the bone when I think of what hackers can do to the stability of so many things that we take for granted. I&#x2019;m also fascinated by the realm of virtual reality, and what happens when you can no longer tell the difference between what is real and what is not. But, mainly, really I just set out to write a great story.</p> <p><strong>Q. There&#x2019;s a lot of great buzz surrounding next year&#x2019;s release of the film version of <em>The Maze Runner</em>. As the author, you must have the world completely imagined in your head. How close do you think the movie will be to that vision? What are you most looking forward to seeing on the big screen? How do you feel your readers will respond to the transformation from page to movie screen?</strong></p> <p>A. Of all the things in my career so far, I have to admit this is the one I&#x2019;m most excited about. I&#x2019;ve been a movie buff all my life, and to see something I wrote being turned into one . . . It&#x2019;s just surreal and hard to believe. It was scary at first to place something so close to you in the hands of someone else, but luckily for me, I&#x2019;m in very, very good hands. I&#x2019;ve been blown away by how much Director Wes Ball and the producers have captured the vision of the book. Also, at how true they&#x2019;re being to the spirit and tone and story. I think my readers are going to love it. Personally, the scene I&#x2019;m most excited to see is the one where Thomas gets stuck in the maze for the first time, with Alby and Minho. </p> <p><strong>Q. Tell us about <em>The Eye of Minds</em>!</strong></p> <p>A. It&#x2019;s in the future, but I really don&#x2019;t want people to think of this as dystopian. It&#x2019;s not. The world is basically in fine shape. But virtual reality technology has gone through the roof and most people are obsessed with it. Like I said earlier, the line between what&#x2019;s real and what&#x2019;s not gets blurred, which sets the stage for some fun twists and mind-bendy stuff. I think my fans will have a good time with it. </p><p>James Dashner is the author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Maze Runner series: <i>The Maze Runner</i>, <i>The Scorch Trials</i>, <i>The Death Cure</i>, <i>The Kill Order</i> and <i>The Fever Code</i>, as well as the bestselling Mortality Doctrine series: <i>The Eye of Minds</i>,<i> The Rule of Thoughts, </i>and <i>The Game of Lives</i>.

Bullied as a boy in the toughest, poorest neighborhood in Brooklyn, Tyson grew up to become one of the most ferocious boxers of all time&#x2014;and the youngest heavyweight champion ever. But his brilliance in the ring was often compromised by reckless behavior. Yet&#x2014;even after hitting rock bottom&#x2014;the man who once admitted being addicted &#x201c;to everything&#x201d; fought his way back, achieving triumphant success as an actor and newfound happiness and stability as a father and husband. Brutal, honest, raw, and often hilarious, <i>Undisputed Truth</i> is the singular journey of an inspiring American original.</p><p><b>Mike Tyson </b>lives in Las Vegas with his wife, Kiki, and their children.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><br> Larry &#x201c;Ratso&#x201d; Sloman</b> lives in New York City.</p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>I spent most of the six weeks between my conviction for rape and sentencing traveling around the country romancing all of my various girlfriends. It was my way of saying good-bye to them. And when I wasn&#x2019;t with them, I was fending off all the women who propositioned me. Everywhere I&#x2019;d go, there were some women who would come up to me and say, &#x201c;Come on, I&#x2019;m not going to say that you raped me. You can come with me. I&#x2019;ll let you film it.&#x201d; I later realized that that was their way of saying &#x201c;We know you didn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d; But I didn&#x2019;t take it that way. I&#x2019;d strike back indignantly with a rude response. Although they were saying what they said out of support, I was in too much pain to realize it. I was an ignorant, mad, bitter guy who had a lot of growing up to do.</p><p>But some of my anger was understandable. I was a twenty-five-year-old kid facing sixty years in jail for a crime that I did not commit. Let me repeat here what I said before the grand jury, during the trial, at my sentencing, at my early-release hearing, after I got out of prison, and what I will continue to say until they put me in the ground. I did not rape Desiree Washington. She knows it, God knows it, and the consequences of her actions are something that she&#x2019;s got to live with for the rest of her life.</p><p>My promoter, Don King, kept assuring me that I would walk from these charges. He told me he was working behind the scenes to make the case disappear. Plus, he had hired Vince Fuller, the best lawyer that a million-dollar fee could buy. Vince just happened to be Don&#x2019;s tax attorney. And Don probably still owed him money. But I knew from the start that I&#x2019;d get no justice. I wasn&#x2019;t being tried in New York or Los Angeles; we were in Indianapolis, Indiana, historically one of the strongholds of the Ku Klux Klan. My judge, Patricia Gifford, was a former sex crimes prosecutor and was known as &#x201c;the Hanging Judge.&#x201d; I had been found guilty by a jury of my &#x201c;peers,&#x201d; only two of whom were black. Another black jury member had been excused by the judge after a fire in the hotel where the jurors were staying. She dismissed him because of his &#x201c;state of mind.&#x201d; Yeah, his state of mind was that he didn&#x2019;t like the food he was being served.</p><p>But in my mind, I had no peers. I was the youngest heavyweight champion in the history of boxing. I was a titan, the reincarnation of Alexander the Great. My style was impetuous, my defenses were impregnable, and I was ferocious. It&#x2019;s amazing how a low self-esteem and a huge ego can give you delusions of grandeur. But after the trial, this god among men had to get his black ass back in court for his sentencing.</p><p>But first I tried some divine intervention. Calvin, my close friend from Chicago, told me about some hoodoo woman who could cast a spell to keep me out of jail.</p><p>&#x201c;You piss in a jar, then put five hundred-dollar bills in there, then put the jar under your bed for three days and then bring it to her and she&#x2019;ll pray over it for you,&#x201d; Calvin told me.</p><p>&#x201c;So the clairvoyant broad is gonna take the pissy pile of hundreds out of the jar, rinse them off, and then go shopping. If somebody gave you a hundred-dollar bill they pissed on, would you care?&#x201d; I asked Calvin. I had a reputation for throwing around money but that was too much even for me.</p><p>Then some friends tried to set me up with a voodoo priest. But they brought around this guy who had a suit on. The guy didn&#x2019;t even look like a drugstore voodoo guy. This asshole needed to be in the swamp; he needed to have on a dashiki. I knew that guy had nothing. He didn&#x2019;t even have a ceremony planned. He just wrote some shit on a piece of paper and tried to sell me on some bullshit I didn&#x2019;t do. He wanted me to wash in some weird oil and pray and drink some special water. But I was drinking goddamn Hennessy. I wasn&#x2019;t going to water down my Hennessy.</p><p>So I settled on getting a Santeria priest to do some witch doctor shit. We went to the courthouse one night with a pigeon and an egg. I dropped the egg on the ground as the bird was released and I yelled, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re free!&#x201d; A few days later, I put on my gray pin-striped suit and went to court.</p><p>After the verdict had been delivered, my defense team had put together a presentence memorandum on my behalf. It was an impressive document. Dr. Jerome Miller, the clinical director of the Augustus Institute in Virginia and one of the nation&#x2019;s leading experts on adult sex offenders, had examined me and concluded that I was &#x201c;a sensitive and thoughtful young man with problems more the result of developmental deficits than of pathology.&#x201d; With regular psychotherapy, he was convinced that my long-term prognosis would be quite good. He concluded, &#x201c;A term in prison will delay the process further and more likely set it back. I would strongly recommend that other options with both deterrent and treatment potential be considered.&#x201d; Of course, the probation officers who put together their sentencing document left that last paragraph out of their summary. But they were eager to include the prosecution&#x2019;s opinion, &#x201c;An assessment of this offense and this offender leads the chief investigator of this case, an experienced sex crimes detective, to conclude that the defendant is inclined to commit a similar offense in the future.&#x201d;</p><p>My lawyers prepared an appendix that contained forty-eight testimonials to my character from such diverse people as my high school principal, my social worker in upstate New York, Sugar Ray Robinson&#x2019;s widow, my adoptive mother, Camille, my boxing hypnotherapist, and six of my girlfriends (and their mothers), who all wrote moving accounts of how I had been a perfect gentleman with them. One of my first girlfriends from Catskill even wrote the judge, &#x201c;I waited three years before having sexual intercourse with Mr. Tyson and not once did he force me into anything. That is the reason I love him, because he loves and respects women.&#x201d;</p><p>But of course, Don being Don, he had to go and overdo it. King had the Reverend William F. Crockett, the Imperial First Ceremonial Master of the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine of North and South America, write a letter on my behalf. The Reverend wrote, &#x201c;I beseech you to spare him incarceration. Though I have not spoken to Mike since the day of his trial, my information is that he no longer uses profanity or vulgarity, reads the Bible daily, prays and trains.&#x201d; Of course, that was all bullshit. He didn&#x2019;t even know me.</p><p>Then there was Don&#x2019;s personal heartfelt letter to the judge. You would have thought that I had come up with a cure for cancer, had a plan for peace in the Middle East, and nursed sick kittens back to health. He talked about my work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation visiting with sick kids. He informed Judge Gifford that every Thanksgiving we gave away forty thousand turkeys to the needy and the hungry. He recounted the time we met with Simon Wiesenthal and I was so moved that I donated a large sum of money to help him hunt down Nazi war criminals. I guess Don forgot that the Klan hated Jews as much as they hated blacks.</p><p>This went on for eight pages, with Don waxing eloquently about me. &#x201c;It is highly unusual for a person his age to be concerned about his fellow man, let alone with the deep sense of commitment and dedication that he possesses. These are God-like qualities, noble qualities of loving, giving and unselfishness. He is a child of God: one of the most gentle, sensitive, caring, loving, and understanding persons that I have ever met in my twenty years&#x2019; experience with boxers.&#x201d; Shit, Don should have delivered the closing arguments instead of my lawyer. But John Solberg, Don&#x2019;s public relations man, cut right to the chase in his letter to Judge Gifford. &#x201c;Mike Tyson is not a scumbag,&#x201d; he wrote.</p><p>I might not have been a scumbag, but I was an arrogant prick. I was so arrogant in the courtroom during the trial that there was no way they were going to give me a break. Even in my moment of doom, I was not a humble person. All those things they wrote about in that report&#x2014;giving people money and turkeys, taking care of people, looking out for the weak and the infirm&#x2014;I did all those things because I <i>wanted</i> to be that humble person, not because I <i>was</i> that person. I wanted so desperately to be humble but there wasn&#x2019;t a humble bone in my body.</p><p>So, armed with all my character testimonials, we appeared in Judge Patricia Gifford&#x2019;s court on March 26, 1992, for my sentencing. Witnesses were permitted and Vince Fuller began the process by calling to the stand Lloyd Bridges, the executive director of the Riverside Residential Center in Indianapolis. My defense team was arguing that instead of jail time, my sentence should be suspended and I should serve my probation term at a halfway house where I could combine personal therapy with community service. Bridges, an ordained minister, ran just such a program and he testified that I would certainly be a prime candidate for his facility.</p><p>But the assistant prosecutor got Bridges to reveal that there had been four escapes recently from his halfway house. And when she got the minister to admit that he had interviewed me in my mansion in Ohio and that we had paid for his airfare, that idea was dead in the water. So now it was only a matter of how much time the Hanging Judge would give me.</p><p>Fuller approached the bench. It was time for him to weave his million-dollar magic. Instead, I got his usual two-bit bullshit. &#x201c;Tyson came in with a lot of excess baggage. The press has vilified him. Not a day goes by that the press doesn&#x2019;t bring up his faults. This is not the Tyson I know. The Tyson I know is a sensitive, thoughtful, caring man. He may be terrifying in the ring, but that ends when he leaves the ring.&#x201d; Now, this was nowhere near Don King hyperbole, but it wasn&#x2019;t bad. Except that Fuller had just spent the whole trial portraying me as a savage animal, a crude bore, bent solely on sexual satisfaction.</p><p>Then Fuller changed the subject to my poverty-stricken childhood and my adoption by the legendary boxing trainer Cus D&#x2019;Amato.</p><p>&#x201c;But there is some tragedy in this,&#x201d; he intoned. &#x201c;D&#x2019;Amato only focused on boxing. Tyson, the man, was secondary to Cus D&#x2019;Amato&#x2019;s quest for Tyson&#x2019;s boxing greatness.&#x201d; Camille, who was Cus&#x2019;s companion for many years, was outraged at his statement. It was like Fuller was pissing on the grave of Cus, my mentor. Fuller went on and on, but he was as disjointed as he had been for the entire trial.</p><p>Now it was my time to address the court. I got up and stood behind the podium. I really hadn&#x2019;t been prepared properly and I didn&#x2019;t even have any notes. But I did have that stupid voodoo guy&#x2019;s piece of paper in my hand. And I knew one thing&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t going to apologize for what went on in my hotel room that night. I apologized to the press, the court, and the other contestants of the Miss Black America pageant, where I met Desiree, but not for my actions in my room.</p><p>&#x201c;My conduct was kind of crass. I agree with that. I didn&#x2019;t rape anyone. I didn&#x2019;t attempt to rape anyone. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; Then I looked back at Greg Garrison, the prosecutor, or persecutor in my case.</p><p>&#x201c;My personal life has been incarcerated. I&#x2019;ve been hurt. This was all one big dream. I didn&#x2019;t come here to beg you for mercy, ma&#x2019;am. I expect the worst. I&#x2019;ve been crucified. I&#x2019;ve been humiliated worldwide. I&#x2019;ve been humiliated socially. I&#x2019;m just happy for all my support. I&#x2019;m prepared to deal with whatever you give me.&#x201d;</p><p>I sat back down behind the defense table and the judge asked me a few questions about being a role model for kids. &#x201c;I was never taught how to handle my celebrity status. I don&#x2019;t tell kids it&#x2019;s right to be Mike Tyson. Parents serve as better role models.&#x201d;</p><p>Now the prosecution had their say. Instead of the redneck Garrison, who argued against me during the trial, his boss, Jeffrey Modisett, the Marion County prosecutor, stepped up. He went on for ten minutes saying that males with money and fame shouldn&#x2019;t get special privileges. Then he read from a letter from Desiree Washington. &#x201c;In the early morning hours of July 19, 1991, an attack on both my body and my mind occurred. I was physically defeated to the point that my innermost person was taken away. In the place of what has been me for eighteen years is now a cold and empty feeling. I am not able to comment on what my future will be. I can only say that each day after being raped has been a struggle to learn to trust again, to smile the way I did and to find the Desiree Lynn Washington who was stolen from me and those who loved me on July 19, 1991. On those occasions when I became angry about the pain that my attacker caused me, God granted me the wisdom to see that he was psychologically ill. Although some days I cry when I see the pain in my own eyes, I am also able to pity my attacker. It has been and still is my wish that he be rehabilitated.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The 40 Day Soul Fast: Your Journey to Authentic Living</h2><p><p></p><i><b>Get ready to experience the best 40 days of your life!</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The 40 Day Soul Fast: Your Journey To Authentic Living </i>is an eight-week study of the life of the soul, the practice of fasting, and the process of living more authentically.

I'm so glad I did because this is a hidden gem. This book doesn't use water to cook the recipes. You use the juice in the cans to boil pasta and rice. I was skeptical but the first recipe I tried Beefy Noodle Casserole was excellent! It is strictly an open and dump recipe and couldn't be easier (as all the recipes are). Another feature I like is the alternative ingredient option. Don't have dried onions? She tells you how much fresh onion to use. These recipes look like you can easily play around with the ingredients. Food storage aside this would make a great cookbook for husbands who can't cook, college students, or just a fast meal. I can't wait to try out more recipes. --Amazon<br><br>This is a great prepper book for cooks who are creatively impaired and need guidelines in times of emergency. I love the authors attitude and her style. You can use these recipes over an open camp fire, in a microwave, or on a traditional burner. They are easy and require no additional water which could be a life saver in times of a severe emergency where water supply is cut off. We are an organic, fresh food kind of family and the products used in this book are canned and processed foods. I still bought the book, however, because I will be using her hints and recipes during emergencies not during every day life when everything we want to eat is easily accessible. Having done stints as a nurse in a 3rd world country where there was no readily available food or clean water we ate mostly out of cans and whipped up meals much like this book advocates. The canned goods were greatly appreciated at that time. When you are hungry, trust me, you will eat whatever food is available and be thankful for it. This is well worth the read and should be part of any preppers library. --Amazon</p><h2>Comfort in an Instant: 75 Comfort Food Recipes for Your Pressure Cooker, Multicooker, and Instant Pot�: A Cookbook</h2><p><b>With 75 all-new recipes--50 of which can be made in under an hour start to finish--Melissa Clark brings her easy sophistication to comfort food classics for any electric pressure cooker, multicooker, or Instant Pot.</b><br><br>The electric pressure cooker makes getting meals on the table fast, convenient, and utterly delicious--and with less mess and stress than any other kitchen appliance.

Whenever they'd get the chance, they'd dance! She'd sing and snap. He'd tappity-tap. What a pair they made! At the end of each day, they'd always say, "ONE, TWO, I'll count on you, 'til the end, we'll be best friends." Until Three jumps in between them . . . Suddenly One only wants to play with Three. "ONE, THREE, odds we'll be!" they chant. Two feels left out. But what can she do? Another character-building counting book by award-winning author Kathryn Otoshi, <i>Two</i> is a powerful story of friendship, loss, letting go, and self-discovery.</p><p>Children's book author and illustrator <b>Kathryn Otoshi&#x2019;s</b> book <i>One</i> was the winner of 15 awards, including the E. B. White Read Aloud Honor Book and the Teacher's Choice Award. She lives in Marin County, CA.K-Gr 2&#x2014;The first stanza of the song "Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver and the other is gold" is, literally, the theme of Otoshi's third book about numbers. Two and One are best friends until Three comes along and disrupts the status quo. Two feels terrible about being left out, but Three convinces One that "odds" are better than the rest," and some verbal teasing ensues. Other odd and even numbers join in the escalating argument until Zero steps in and convinces Two to put a halt to the escalating division. One, Two, and Three apologize for the way they've been acting, and all the numbers, from Zero to Nine, decide it's a good thing to be open to all potential friends. Some lines rhyme, but others don't, which can create a problem in the reading cadence the first time around. This tale, featuring colorful numbers placed on large white pages, presents some clever wordplay and has a moral that will be best understood by children if the book is shared with an adult.&#x2014;Maryann H.

Mary Roach dodges hostile fire with the U.S. Marine Corps Paintball Team as part of a study on hearing loss and survivability in combat. She visits the fashion design studio of U.S. Army Natick Labs and learns why a zipper is a problem for a sniper. She visits a repurposed movie studio where amputee actors help prepare Marine Corps medics for the shock and gore of combat wounds. At Camp Lemmonier, Djibouti, in east Africa, we learn how diarrhea can be a threat to national security. Roach samples caffeinated meat, sniffs an archival sample of a World War II stink bomb, and stays up all night with the crew tending the missiles on the nuclear submarine USS Tennessee. She answers questions not found in any other book on the military: Why is DARPA interested in ducks? How is a wedding gown like a bomb suit? Why are shrimp more dangerous to sailors than sharks? Take a tour of duty with Roach, and you&#x2019;ll never see our nation&#x2019;s defenders in the same way again.</p> 15 illustrations</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2016:</strong> It takes a special kind of writer to make topics ranging from death to our gastrointestinal tract interesting (sometimes hilariously so), and pop science writer Mary Roach is always up to the task. In her latest book, <em>Grunt</em>, she explores how our soldiers combat their non-gun-wielding opponents--panic, heat exhaustion, the runs, and more. It will give you a new appreciation not only for our men and women in uniform (and by the way, one of the innumerable things you&#x2019;ll learn is how and why they choose the fabric for those uniforms), but for the unsung scientist-soldiers tasked with coming up with ways to keep the &#x201c;grunts&#x201d; alive and well. If you are at all familiar with Roach&#x2019;s oeuvre, you know her enthusiasm for her subjects is palpable and infectious. This latest offering is no exception. <em>--Erin Kodicek, The Amazon Book Review</em>Mary Roach is the author of Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War, Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife, and Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers.

In the Americas we join a family bikepacking trip in Ecuador; we pedal the Natchez Trace Parkway and stop at legendary music spots; we ride the Pacific Coast Highway in Oregon and California; go mountain biking in Moab and Canada; and explore the cities of Buenos Aires and New York by bicycle. </p><p>European rides include easy-going trips around Lake Constance, along the Danube and the Loire, and coast-to-coast routes; routes in Tuscany, Spain and Corsica; and professional journeys up Mt Ventoux and around the Tour of Flanders. </p><p>In Asia, we venture through Vietnam's valleys; complete the Mae Hong Son circuit in northern Thailand; cross the Indian Himalayas; and pedal through Bhutan. And in Australia and New Zealand we take in Tasmania and Queensland by mountain bike; cycle into Victoria's high country and around Adelaide on road bikes; and try some of New Zealand's celebrated cycle trails. </p><p>Each ride is illustrated with stunning photography and a map. A toolkit of practical details - where to start and finish, how to get there, where to stay and more - helps riders plan their own trips. There are also suggestions for three more similar rides around the world for each story. Each piece shows how cycling is a fantastic way to get to know a place, a people and their culture. </p><p><b>About Lonely Planet: </b>Started in 1973, Lonely Planet has become the world's leading travel guide publisher with guidebooks to every destination on the planet, gift and lifestyle books and stationery, as well as an award-winning website, magazines, a suite of mobile and digital travel products, and a dedicated traveller community.

It&#x2019;s this struggle that makes grace more story than doctrine. It&#x2019;s the struggle that reminds us that grace is bigger than compassion or forgiveness. That struggle is the context for both. When we are on the receiving end, grace is refreshing. When it is required of us, it is often disturbing. But when correctly applied, it seems to solve just about everything.&nbsp; This struggle is not new; it has been going on since the beginning.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x2015;Andy Stanley</i></p><p><b>We find in the pages of Scripture that the stories found there often mirror our own stories, and that&nbsp;we&nbsp;too need the very thing we do not deserve: <i>the grace of God.</i></b></p><b></b><p>From the beginning, the church has had an uneasy relationship with grace. The gravitational pull is always toward graceless religion. The odd thing is that when you read the New Testament, the only thing Jesus stood against consistently was graceless religion.

Busted as a teenager for selling acid in the summer of 1968, Parish landed in Riker's Island. The experience changed him and after getting out he did his best to stay out of trouble, securing a job moving music equipment at the New York State Pavilion. The first show he worked was a Grateful Dead concert in July of 1969 and Parish was captivated by the music. A life seemingly headed nowhere had suddenly found its calling as he fell in quickly with a band of likeminded misfits who formed the nucleus of what would be the greatest road crew in rock 'n' roll history.<br><br>Parish traveled to California where his apprenticeship began. Working for the band for free and learning his craft, Parish got to know Jerry, Bobby, Phil, Billy and Mickey and through the years their relationships forged an unbreakable bond. He became very close with Garcia in particular, acting as his personal roadie and later manager for his solo performances and Garcia Band shows. He was there during times of trouble (like when a pimp held Garcia hostage at gunpoint in a New York hotel room), spending hours by his bedside when Garcia was in a coma in 1986, and performing the duties of best man at his wedding. He was also the last friend to see Garcia alive. <br><br>Throughout the Dead's historic run, there were parties of biblical proportion and celebrity run-ins with everybody from Bob Dylan to Frank Sinatra--but there was a dark side to life on the road and tragedy didn't just strike the musicians.<br><br>But <i>Home Before Daylight</i> is a story of friendship, of music and redemption. It is a piece of music history, one that reflects the American spirit of adventure and brotherhood. Seen through Steve Parish's eyes and experiences, The Grateful Dead's wild ride has never been so revealing.<br></p><p>The life of rock band roadie would hardly inspire the likes of say, Emile Zola. But Steve Parish's 30+ year tenure with the Grateful Dead, the Jerry Garcia Band, and its survivors makes for compelling reading, even if his low-key, often self-deprecating reportorial style can't hope to begin to unravel the complex psychology that drove the symptomatic excesses---and all too many tragedies--of the 60's most enduringly emblematic American band. There's more here than sex, drugs, and rock and roll, even if Parish's writing struggles to encompass the meaning of it all. And make no mistake; The Dead and their coterie were, in the estimation of unlikely Deadhead Joseph Campbell, nothing short of potent modern mythology evolving before his very eyes. In the fallout of one memorable backstage incident, the author even found himself parodied by John Belushi in an <i>SNL</i> skit written by Deadheads Al Franken and Tom Davis. Parish casts little judgment on the oft-debauched actions of his cohorts here, though he often stops to note the brightness of their humanity. A paradoxical marriage of unrestrained hedonism and radical Christian social conscience, The Dead's world seems to still baffle Parish. His continued wonderment at it all is one of the book's charms; his tortured sense of helplessness in the addiction-fueled decline and death of Jerry Garcia, its spiritual and musical leader, its most tragic mystery. <i>--Jerry McCulley</i>Never before has a true insider, a member of the Grateful Dead family from the band's early days through today, told the story of life on the road with the Grateful Dead. From San Francisco to Europe to Egypt and back again; from wild parties and horrible tragedies; from laughter to heartbreak--this is the inside story of the most legendary American rock 'n' roll band of all time and the tale of a man who lived it, from roadie to manager and brother.<br><br>"The Grateful Dead was all about improvisation, and Steve spoke that language with flourish...Steve was a central figure, often in the lead of what was going on backstage, in the hotels, on the airplanes, busses, boats, or whatever. If ever I get around to writing a book, you'll be reading plenty more about Steve."<br>- Bob Weir, from the foreword<br></p><h2>The Patron Saint of Liars: A Novel</h2><p><p>In 1992, celebrated novelist Ann Patchett launched her remarkable career with the publication of her debut novel,&nbsp;<i>The Patron Saint of Liars, </i>a best-selling book that is &#x201c;beautifully written . . . a first novel that second- and third-time novelists would envy for its grace, insight, and compassion&#x201d; (<i>Boston Herald</i>).</p><p>St. Elizabeth&#x2019;s, a home for unwed mothers in Habit, Kentucky, usually harbors its residents for only a little while.

Preschool-Grade 2. --Shelle Rosenfeld</p><h2>Just Medicine: A Cure for Racial Inequality in American Health Care</h2><p><p>Just Medicine offers us a new, effective, and innovative plan to regulate implicit biases and eliminate the inequalities they cause, and to save the lives they endanger.</p><p>Over 84,000 black and brown lives are needlessly lost each year due to health disparities, the unfair, unjust, and avoidable differences between the quality and quantity of health care provided to Americans who are members of racial and ethnic minorities and care provided to whites. Health disparities have remained stubbornly entrenched in the American health care system&#x2014;and in Just Medicine Dayna Bowen Matthew finds that they principally arise from unconscious racial and ethnic biases held by physicians, institutional providers, and their patients.</p><br><p>Implicit bias is the single most important determinant of health and health care disparities. Because we have missed this fact, the money we spend on training providers to become culturally competent, expanding wellness education programs and community health centers, and even expanding access to health insurance will have only a modest effect on reducing health disparities. We will continue to utterly fail in the effort to eradicate health disparities unless we enact strong, evidence-based legal remedies that accurately address implicit and unintentional forms of discrimination, to replace the weak, tepid, and largely irrelevant legal remedies currently available.</p><p>Our continued failure to fashion an effective response that purges the effects of implicit bias from American health care, Matthew argues, is unjust and morally untenable. In this book, she unites medical, neuroscience, psychology, and sociology research on implicit bias and health disparities with her own expertise in civil rights and constitutional law.</p></p><p><b>Dayna Bowen Matthew</b> is William L. Matheson and Robert M. Morgenthau Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Virginia School of Law."Having presented a thorough picture of the problems facing minorities in the health care system, Matthew proposes a solution: reform of specific sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which she claims would provide a legal and moral basis to hold liable those who unconsciously discriminate and would help to establish a new standard of care in medicine....[F]ood for thought here." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>"A powerful socio-legal reflection on the history of health disparities and how that terrible legacy now further impedes racial equality and results in death. . . . Masterfully written. The author provides a captivating narrative that is at once stark and grizzly (how many ways can people of color suffer at the hands of medicine) and yet so provocatively and artfully written that one cannot stop reading. Not since Harriet Washingtons page-turning (and award-winning) book,Medical Apartheid, has there been another that makes medical discourse so captivating." (Michele Goodwin,Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor of Law, University of California, Irvine)<br><br>"The book is highly engaging and worthwhile reading for health care providers, hospital administrators, insurers, medical students and educators, and those involved in civil rights law." (<i>Health Affairs</i>)<br><br>"A remarkably ambitious and provocative book on the ways that implicit bias exacerbates racial disparities in health. Matthew provides a critical analysis and call to action that should be taken seriously by all health care professionals, policymakers, and anyone interested in health equality." (Osagie K. Obasogie,UC Hastings)<br><br>"Her ambitious book lays out a case for a legal remedy for racial health inequality." (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"This book will spark much debate." (<i>Choice Connect</i>)<br><br>"Just Medicineis necessary reading for all who envision a society in which health equity is a moral imperative. I would place Matthew's contributions on the scale of Michelle Alexander's transformational book,The New Jim Crow. Matthew not only documents the problem of color-blind racism but also provides solution-oriented road maps for a way forward." (<i>Political Science Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"Just Medicine is a must-read for everyone! Weaving together from insights from research in history, sociology, psychology, law, and more, Matthew crushes the argument that racial disparities in health and health care are due to factors like biology and bad behavior. Time and time again, Matthew exposes the role of racial bias and discrimination in disparate outcomes. More so, she offers meaningful and achievable suggestions for resolving these problems. Lets hope those with the most power to create these changes are paying attention to this important scholarly contribution!" (Angela Onwuachi-Willig,Charles M. and Marion J.

His mind and heart claimed and cleansed by Christ, he had one goal and dream: To take the fresh hope of the Gospel to everyone in his new world. On the outside were people who loved him, who had prayed for him since his gang years. Their hope: to be granted parole. However, in power was a governor who declared that the only way a &#34;lifer&#34; was going to leave prison while he was governor was in a pine box. Let Brian tell you in his own words of his journey downward into the world of gangs, how he finally came face-to-face with the consequences of his actions and attitude, and the spiritual journey that followed, bringing him upward from the lowest point a man could ever face in his life. You, too, will arise.</p><p></p><h2>Bill Evans Omnibook for Piano</h2><p>(Jazz Transcriptions).

Then I&#x2019;d been broken and battered and well on my way to losing myself forever. I&#x2019;d felt dark inside, but the people who loved me most had been bright, beautiful beacons of hope, and I&#x2019;d been able to find strength in their light. I&#x2019;d fought my way out of darkness.</p> <p>This time I didn&#x2019;t have any hope. I couldn&#x2019;t find a light. I deserved to stay lost, to remain shattered. This time I didn&#x2019;t deserve to be saved.</p> <p>Detective Marx had taken me to the Tulsa County sheriff&#x2019;s office instead of sticking me in jail with the rest of the criminals who were newly arrested. On the seemingly endless trip from the House of Night to the big brown stone sheriff&#x2019;s department building on First Street he&#x2019;d talked to me, explaining that he&#x2019;d made a call&#x2014;pulled some strings&#x2014;and I was going to be put in a special holding cell until my attorney could make arrangements for my arraignment, so I could get released on bail. He&#x2019;d looked back and forth from the road to my reflection in the rearview mirror. I&#x2019;d met his eyes. It didn&#x2019;t take more than a glance to read his expression.</p> <p>He knew I had no chance for bail.</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need a lawyer,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t want bail.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Zoey, you&#x2019;re not thinking straight. Give it a little time. Believe me, you&#x2019;re going to need a lawyer. And if you could get out on bail, that would be the best thing for you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But it wouldn&#x2019;t be the best thing for Tulsa. No one is going to let a monster loose.&#x201d; My voice had sounded flat and emotionless, but inside I was screaming over and over and over.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not a monster,&#x201d; Marx had said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Did you see those two men I killed?&#x201d;</p> <p>He&#x2019;d glanced at me in the mirror again and nodded. I could see that his lips had pressed into a line, like he was trying to keep himself from saying something. For some reason his eyes were still kind. I couldn&#x2019;t meet them.</p> <p>Looking out the window, I&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;Then you know what I am. Whether you call it monster, or killer, or rogue fledgling vampyre&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all the same. I deserve to be locked up. I deserve what&#x2019;s going to happen to me.&#x201d;</p> <p>He&#x2019;d quit talking to me then, and I&#x2019;d been glad.</p> <p>A black iron fence surrounded the sheriff&#x2019;s department&#x2019;s parking lot, and Marx drove to a rear entrance where he had to wait to be identified before a massive gate opened. Then he stopped and led me, handcuffed, through a back door and a big, busy room that was sectioned off with cubical dividers. When we walked in, cops were talking and phones were ringing. As soon as they saw it was Marx and me, it was like an off switch had been thrown. The talking stopped and the gawking started.</p> <p>I stared straight ahead at a spot on the wall and concentrated on not letting the screaming that was going on inside me come out.</p> <p>We had to walk all the way through the room. Then we went through a door that led to one of those rooms that look like the ones you see on <i>Law &amp; Order: SVU</i> where awesome Mariska Hargitay interrogates the bad guys.</p> <p>It had given me a jolt to realize that what I had done had made <i>me</i> one of the bad guys.</p> <p>There was a door at the far end of the room that led to a little hallway. Marx turned left. He&#x2019;d paused to swipe his ID card, and a massively thick steel door opened. On the other side of the door, the hall dead-ended in just a few feet. There was another metal door on our right, which was open. The bottom was solid, but about shoulder high bars started. Thick, black bars. That was where Detective Marx stopped. I glanced inside. The room was a tomb. I suddenly had trouble breathing, and my eyes skittered away from the horrible place to find Marx&#x2019;s familiar face.</p> <p>&#x201c;With the power you have, I imagine you could break out of here.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d spoken quietly, as if he thought someone might be listening to us.</p> <p>&#x201c;I left the Seer Stone at the House of Night. That&#x2019;s what gave me the power to kill those two men.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So you didn&#x2019;t kill them by yourself?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I got mad and threw my anger at them. The Seer Stone just gave me a boost. Detective Marx, it was my fault. Period, the end.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d tried to sound tough and sure of myself, but my voice had gone all soft and shaky.</p> <p>&#x201c;Can you break out of here, Zoey?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I honestly don&#x2019;t know, but I promise I&#x2019;m not going to try.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d drawn a deep breath and let it out in a rush, telling him the absolute truth. &#x201c;Because of what I did, I belong here, and no matter what happens to me, I deserve it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, I promise you that no one can bother you here. You&#x2019;ll be safe,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said kindly. &#x201c;I made sure of that. So whatever is going to happen to you, it won&#x2019;t be because a lynch mob got to you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; My voice had broken, but I&#x2019;d gotten the words out.</p> <p>He took off my handcuffs.</p> <p>I hadn&#x2019;t been able to move.</p> <p>&#x201c;You have to go in the cell now.&#x201d;</p> <p>I&#x2019;d made my feet move. When I was inside, I turned, and just before he closed the door I&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to see anyone, especially not anyone from the House of Night.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You understand what you&#x2019;re saying, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>I&#x2019;d nodded. &#x201c;I know what happens to a fledgling who isn&#x2019;t around vampyres.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So basically, you&#x2019;re sentencing yourself.&#x201d;</p> <p>He hadn&#x2019;t phrased it as a question, but I&#x2019;d answered him anyway. &#x201c;What I&#x2019;m doing is taking responsibility for my actions.&#x201d;</p> <p>He&#x2019;d hesitated, and it seemed like he had something else he wanted to say, but Marx had ended up shrugging, sighing, and saying, &#x201c;Okay, then. Good luck, Zoey. I&#x2019;m sorry that it has come to this.&#x201d;</p> <p>The door closed as if sealing a coffin.</p> <p>There was no window, no outside light except for what peeked in from the hallway between the bars on the door. At the end of the cell there was a bed&#x2014;a thin mattress on a slab of something hard attached to the wall. There was an aluminum toilet sticking out of the middle of a parallel wall, not far from the bed. It didn&#x2019;t have any lid. The floor was black concrete. The walls were gray. The blanket on the bed was gray. Feeling like I was in a waking nightmare, I walked to the bed.</p> <p>Six steps. That&#x2019;s how long the cell was. Six steps.</p> <p>I went to the side wall and walked across the cell. Five steps. It was five steps across.</p> <p>I&#x2019;d been right. If you didn&#x2019;t count the distance to the ceiling, I was locked in a tomb the size of a coffin.</p> <p>I sat on the bed, drew my knees up to my chest, and hugged them. My body shook and shook and shook.</p> <p>I was going to die.</p> <p>I couldn&#x2019;t remember if Oklahoma was a death penalty state. Like I&#x2019;d actually paid attention in history class while Coach Fitz played movie after movie? But that didn&#x2019;t matter anyway. I had left the House of Night. Alone. With no vampyres. Even Detective Marx understood what that meant. It was only a matter of time before my body began rejecting the Change.</p> <p>Like I&#x2019;d hit a rewind button in my head, images of dying fledglings played against the screen of my closed eyes: Elliott, Stevie Rae, Stark, Erin&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>I squeezed my eyes shut even tighter.</p> <p><i>It happens fast. Really, really fast,</i> I promised myself.</p> <p>Then another death scene flashed through my memory. Two men&#x2014;homeless, obnoxious, but alive until I&#x2019;d lost control of my temper. I remembered how I&#x2019;d thrown my anger at them&nbsp;&#x2026; how they&#x2019;d crashed against the stone wall beside the little grotto at Woodward Park&nbsp;&#x2026; how they&#x2019;d lay there, crumpled, broken&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p><i>But they&#x2019;d been moving! I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d killed them! I hadn&#x2019;t meant to kill them! It really had just been a terrible accident!</i> My mind shouted.</p> <p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I spoke sharply to the selfish part of me that wanted to make excuses, wanted to run away from consequences. &#x201c;People convulse when they&#x2019;re dying. They are dead because I killed them. It won&#x2019;t make up for what I did, but I deserve to die.&#x201d;</p> <p>I curled up under the scratchy gray blanket and faced the wall. I ignored the dinner tray they slid through a slat in the door. I wasn&#x2019;t hungry anyway, but <i>whatever</i> that was on that tray definitely didn&#x2019;t tempt me.</p> <p>And for some reason, the bad food smell reminded me of the last most awesome food smell I&#x2019;d experienced&#x2014;psaghetti at the House of Night, surrounded by my friends.</p> <p>But I&#x2019;d been too stressed out by my Aurox/Heath/Stark problem. I hadn&#x2019;t appreciated the psaghetti, not really. Just like I hadn&#x2019;t appreciated my friends. Or Stark. Not really.</p> <p>I hadn&#x2019;t stopped to consider the fact that I was <i>lucky</i> to have two such amazing guys love me. Instead I&#x2019;d been pissed and frustrated.</p> <p>I thought about Aphrodite. I remembered how I&#x2019;d heard her talking to Shaylin about watching me. I remembered how I&#x2019;d stormed in and shoved Shaylin with the power of my anger focused through the Seer Stone.</p> <p>The memory made me cringe in shame.</p> <p>Aphrodite had been absolutely right. I had needed watching. It wasn&#x2019;t like she&#x2019;d been able to reason with me. Hell, when she&#x2019;d tried, I hadn&#x2019;t been anything close to reasonable.</p> <p>I cringed again as I remembered how close I&#x2019;d come to throwing my anger at Aphrodite.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ohmygoddess! If I had, I could have killed my friend.&#x201d; I spoke into my palms as I covered my face with my hands in shame.</p> <p>It didn&#x2019;t matter that the Seer Stone somehow, without me really asking it to, amplified my powers. I&#x2019;d had plenty of warning. All those times I was annoyed and the stone got hotter and hotter. Why hadn&#x2019;t I stopped and thought through what was going on? Why hadn&#x2019;t I asked someone for help? I&#x2019;d asked Lenobia for boyfriend advice. <i>Boyfriend advice! I should have been asking for an anger intervention!</i></p> <p>But I hadn&#x2019;t asked for any help with anything except what my tunnel vision had been focused on: <i>me.</i></p> <p>I&#x2019;d been a self-absorbed bitch.</p> <p>I deserved to be where I was. I deserved my consequences.</p> <p>The lights in the hallway went out. I had no idea what time it was. It seemed like years instead of months since I&#x2019;d been a human&#x2014;a normal teenager who had to go to bed too darn early on school nights.</p> <p>I wished, with everything inside me, that I could call Superman and have him fly backward around the earth until time turned back to yesterday. Then I&#x2019;d be home, at the House of Night, with my friends. I&#x2019;d run straight into Stark&#x2019;s arms and tell him how much I love and appreciate him. I&#x2019;d tell him I was sorry about the Aurox/Heath mess, and that we&#x2019;d figure it out&#x2014;all two point five of us&#x2014;but that I was going to appreciate the love that surrounded me no matter what. Then I&#x2019;d yank that damn Seer Stone off, find Aphrodite, and give it to her to keep it safe like she was my Frodo.</p> <p>But it was too late for wishes. Turning back time is only a fantasy. Superman isn&#x2019;t real.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t sleep. It was night, and night had become my day. Right now I should be at school with my friends, living my life, having what was (for me) a normal &#x201c;day.&#x201d; Instead I lay there, hugging myself. I should have been smarter. I should have been stronger. I should have been anything except a selfish brat.</p> <p>Hours later I heard the slot in the door open again, and when I turned over I saw that someone had taken away my untouched tray. Good. Maybe the smell would go away, too.</p> <p>I had to pee, but I didn&#x2019;t want to. Didn&#x2019;t want to use the bare toilet sticking out of the wall in the middle of the room. I stared at the corners of the walls where they met the ceiling. Cameras.</p> <p>Was it legal for wardens to watch prisoners pee?</p> <p>Did the regular rules even count with me? I mean, I&#x2019;d never heard of a fledgling or a vampyre being put on trial in human court, or going to human prison.</p> <p><i>I don&#x2019;t have to worry about that. I&#x2019;ll drown in my own blood way before I go to trial.</i></p> <p>Weirdly enough, that thought was a comfort, and as the light in the hallway came on, I fell into a restless, dreamless sleep.</p> <p>It seemed like ten seconds later when the slot in the door banged open and another aluminum tray sloshed into my cell. The noise jolted me awake, but I was still groggy, still trying to fall back to sleep&#x2014;until the scent of eggs and bacon had my mouth watering. How long had it been since I&#x2019;d eaten anything? Ugh, I felt terrible. Blearily, I got up and walked the six steps to the door, picking up the tray and carrying it carefully back to my rumpled bed.</p> <p>The eggs were scrambled and super runny. The bacon was beef jerky hard. There was coffee, a carton of milk, and dry toast.</p> <p>I would have given almost anything for one bowl of Count Chocula and a can of brown pop.</p> <p>I took a bite of the eggs, and they were so salty they almost made me choke.</p> <p>But instead of choking, I began to cough. Within that terrible cough I tasted something, something metallic and slick and warm and weirdly wonderful.</p> <p>It was my own blood.</p> <p>Fear rocketed through me, making me weak and dizzy and nauseous. <i>It&#x2019;s happening so soon? I&#x2019;m not ready! I&#x2019;m not ready!</i></p> <p>Trying to clear my throat, trying to breathe, I spit out the eggs, ignored the pink tinge in the runny yellow, put the tray on the floor, and curled up on the bed, wrapping my arms around myself and waiting for more coughing and more blood&#x2014;a lot more blood.

Judy is known for her spirited readings of the series. <br><br></p>Kindergarten-Grade 3-This is a wildly wonderful book about a hyperactive kitten, Skippyjon Jones, whose head and ears are too big for his body, and whose imagination is too intense for his mama. According to her, he needs to do some serious thinking about what it means to be a Siamese cat instead of a bird (Skippyjon always wakes up and eats worms with his feathered friends). She sends him to his room, where he imagines he is a Chihuahua ("My name is Skippito Friskito./I fear not a single bandito"). Chock-full of rhyming chants and Spanish expressions, the feline's adventure as a doggy Zorro ends in chaos. His frazzled mother gives him a hug anyway and says, "Say good night, Skippyjon Jones." "Buenas noches, mis amigos," says the kitten, as he bounces on his bed all ready for another adventure. The buoyant and colorful cartoon illustrations match the exuberant text perfectly. Spanish-speaking children will be especially delighted by the words and humor; others may be a little bewildered by all of the foreign phrases and will need some explanation, but the story definitely has the potential of a fun read-aloud. A good multicultural offering.<br><i>Judith Constantinides, formerly at East Baton Rouge Parish Main Library, LA</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jackie Mize--who was told it was impossible for her to have a baby and who is now the mother of four beautiful children--provides readers with a supernatural answer. Filled with powerful and intimate scriptural prayers, this little book gives readers a way to come before Father God in faith with issues from having a difficult time getting pregnant to joyfully cradling that precious gift from God in their arms.

If you come to Paris with Eloise you will always be glad you did. <br> <i>Eloise in Paris</i> was first published in 1957, the second of the Eloise quartet, and an immediate bestseller. Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight traveled to Paris to research the book, and the illustrations are dotted with the celebrities they knew there: Richard Avedon takes Eloise's passport photograph; Christian Dior prods her tummy, while his young assistant, Yves Saint Laurent, looks on; Lena Horne sits at an outdoor caf�. <br> All four Eloise books by the late Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight -- <i>Eloise: The Absolutely Essential Edition, Eloise in Paris, Eloise at Christmastime,</i> and <i>Eloise in Moscow --</i> are now being reissued by Simon &amp; Schuster.</p><p>Why is Eloise, 6-year-old resident of the Plaza Hotel in New York City, going to Paris? She and Nanny were summoned by a cablegram from Eloise's mother, and, as we all know, "If you are going to Paris France / you have to turn into French and absolutely go wild / and put adhesive tape on you / and fall down a lot and sklathe the window / and stretch into the curtain and..." Ahh, the deliciously mad logic of Eloise. She promptly gets on the phone to tell everyone--including room service--that she is Paris bound. There's so much to do--shots, passport pictures, packing ("Here's what else you have to take / Everything"), and of course the endless good-byes. Fortunately, "Sabena is the only airline / that will allow you to travel with a turtle" so Skipperdee comes along for the ride. At last, <i>ils arrivent</i>! <p> Hilary Knight captures familiar Parisian sights in his delicately hewn pen-and-ink illustrations of everything from the Arc de Triomphe to the Seine to the Champs �lys�es to outdoor caf�s. Children will study every detail of each <i>rawther</i> extraordinaire illustration, from Weenie's snout (such as it is) peeking out from under the hotel bed to the bandy-legged, bunchy-shirted Eloise with her necklace of champagne corks. Even if children don't understand half of the quirks and language directed toward precocious grownups ("Langoustines make very good fingernails"), they'll find more than enough to delight them down to their very toes. Adults, of course, will also revel in this fascinatingly eccentric romp. And if you know anyone who loves (or will love) Paris, this book is the perfect bon voyage gift. <i>Eloise in Paris</i> was first published in 1957, the sequel to the original <i>Eloise</i>, and is every bit as wondrous. If you're in search of more Eloise (and who isn't really?), don't miss <i>The Absolutely Essential Eloise</i>, the original <i>Eloise</i> book with an additional scrapbook that tells the whole story of this impish character and her devoted creators.

(Ages 5 to 105) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Kay Thompson (1909&#x2013;1998) was a singer, dancer, vocal arranger, and coach of many MGM musicals in the 1940s. The Eloise character grew out of the voice of a precocious six-year-old that Miss Thompson put on to amuse her friends. Collaborating with Hilary Knight on what was an immediate bestseller, Kay Thompson became a literary sensation when <i>Eloise</i> was published in 1955. The book has sold more than two million copies to date. Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight created four more Eloise books, <i>Eloise in Paris, Eloise at Christmas, Eloise in Moscow,</i> and <i>Eloise Takes a Bawth.</i><br><br>Hilary Knight, son of artist-writers Clayton Knight and Katharine Sturges, was educated at the Art Students League, where he studied with Reginald Marsh. Besides the Eloise books, Hilary Knight has illustrated more than fifty books for children, six of which he wrote himself.

In those days, preemies were put in an incubator and left alone. In my imagination, armed with what I've gleaned from years of therapy, I can return to those first days. What I see first looks like a tunnel with a clear roof. I am looking up through the incubator. A bright light shines all the time. The walls beyond are plain and white. I feel cut off from everyone and don't know who I belong to. The only time I am touched is to be cleaned.</p><p>Recently, I asked my mother how much she held me those weeks we were still in the hospital after my birth.</p><p>"Why, I held you all the time!" she said.</p><p>"How much?" I insisted. All the time was not my memory.</p><p>"Why, whenever they'd let me."</p><p>"How often was that?" I persisted.</p><p>"I held you every time they brought you to me to be fed" she said. "Twenty minutes, three times a day."</p><p>An hour a day my first three weeks of life. My baby self knew that wasn't nearly enough.</p><p>That touch deprivation continued. When I was six months old my father left my mother, so she left me with my grandparents and took off. My grandparents were not the most demonstrative people in the world. Maybe I saw them kiss each other once in all the years I lived with them. Me, they never touched.</p><p>When I was ten my mother remarried and decided she wanted me back. The second night I was in their house -- my mother worked nights -- my stepfather came into my room and got into bed with me.</p><p>After never being touched or held, I felt hands on my body. His touch made me feel sick inside. Something told me this wasn't right but nothing had ever told me that my feelings mattered or that I had a choice about anything. So I put up with it.</p><p>I remember the first time a boy touched me. I was thirteen, he was sixteen. We were at a teen dance and all I could think about was that I finally had a boyfriend. He danced with me and kept his arm around me all night. Was I jubilant? Was I thrilled? No, I was terrified. The only kind of touch I'd ever known disgusted me.</p><p>This was a nice boy who was completely proper and respectful, but when he put his arm across my shoulders I felt sick. My heart was beating so loudly from fear I could hear its pounding cadence in my ears. Far from enjoying my first healthy experience with a boy, my heart beat like that far into the night, hours after I was home alone. I avoided his calls. I wouldn't see him again.</p><p><b>Beth's Story</b></p><p>My mother was over 40 when I was born. My father, older still, was a military man. He commanded the household and everything in it, especially me. From preschool on he had long, serious discussions with every one of my teachers. He watched what I ate, directed my play, and as I got older interviewed my friends. It was he who taught me the neat way to dress, the proper way to sit and stand, and the meaning of duty, obedience, and loyalty.</p><p>When I had my first period, however, we were both shocked. Until then I had been perfect -- straight As, conducting myself with proper military bearing. I was the son he'd never had. But becoming a woman interrupted my perfection. He didn't have to tell me but I knew I'd failed him in a big way. So I stopped eating. Eventually I stopped looking like a woman and my period stopped. My mother was concerned but my father wasn't. And since she didn't have a lot of say in our house nothing happened. Eventually, however, I was so thin and had so much trouble concentrating that my mother insisted I see a doctor. The doctor put me in the hospital immediately.</p><p>My father didn't want me away from him, but my therapists said I was anorexic and needed treatment. They forced me to eat. When my therapy group upset me, I called my father and he told me not to listen to them. He called my counselor and argued with her that nothing was wrong with me. The more he talked to me, the more I realized that it was ridiculous for me to be in the hospital. Those people didn't know what they were talking about. I was just fine. Besides, I missed him. He needed me. Finally my father came to get me. He didn't even care that insurance would no longer cover the costs because I'd left against medical advice. He wanted me with him that much.</p><p><b>Boundaries -- What Are They?</b></p><p>Therapists and recovering people toss the word around easily. But what do they mean? Why have these stories been included? Do they say something about boundaries? Maybe not yet, but they will.</p><p>In this chapter we'll look at the big picture, boundaries from an eagle's point of view. Later we'll close in on the details. We'll swoop down on specific aspects of boundaries so that you'll recognize both the forest and the trees.</p><p>Exercises pepper the chapters. Enjoy them. Most are brief. Some involve other people. All let your body and heart in on the knowledge you're collecting with your mind -- in learning what boundaries are all about.</p><p><b>An Amoeba Is Not a Tulip</b></p><p>So what is a boundary? A boundary is a limit or edge that defines you as separate from others. A boundary is a limit that promotes integrity.</p><p>Your skin is a boundary. Everything within your skin is the physical you.</p><p>Each living organism is separated from every other living organism by a physical barrier. Amoebae, orange trees, frogs, leopards, bacteria, tulips, turtles, salmon -- all have physical limits that delineate them as unique from other organisms. This limit can be breached by injury or other organisms, if the breach is severe enough or if the invading organism is toxic or hostile, the host organism can die. An intact physical boundary preserves life.</p><p>Even an organism's physical components have boundaries. Your nerves are covered with a sheath or membrane. Your bones are distinct from your muscles. The physical world abounds with boundaries. Were it not so, when we sat down, we'd pass right through the chair (and the chair through us) and be sprawled on the floor. Except then we'd pass through the floor, too. And then the earth? Where would we stop?</p><p><b>We Are Surrounded by an Invisible Circle</b></p><p>Our skin marks the limit of our physical selves, but we have another boundary that extends beyond our skin. We become aware of this when someone stands too close. It's as if we are surrounded by an invisible circle, a comfort zone. This zone is fluid. A lover, say, can stand closer than most friends, and a friend can stand closer than a stranger. With someone who is hostile we might need a great deal of distance.</p><p>We have other boundaries as well -- emotional, spiritual, sexual, and relational. You have a limit to what is safe and appropriate. You have a border that separates you from others. Within this border is your <i>youness,</i> that which makes you an individual different and separate from others.</p><p>What is an emotional boundary? We have a set of feelings and reactions that are distinctly ours. We respond to the world uniquely based on our individual perceptions, our special histories, our values, goals, and concerns. We can find people who react similarly, but no one reacts precisely as we do.</p><p><b>My Size Is None of Your Business</b></p><p>When it comes to how others treat us emotionally, we have limits on what is safe and appropriate. I came out of a store in downtown Seattle and a stranger started screaming at me about a religious matter. I turned and walked away. I do not have to accept screaming from anyone. I will accept appropriate anger from my friends and loved ones, but even then, I determine how close I'm willing to be to an angry person.</p><p>When I was younger, my landlady routinely commented about my weight. "You're getting bigger, ain't cha."</p><p>I let her say those things to me because I didn't know any better. Now I know that no one has a right to comment on my body. If that happened today, I'd tell her, "My size is none of your business and I want you to keep those thoughts to yourself." If she persisted, I'd also persist. I might never again deal with her in person. I might even move, whatever it would take to protect my emotional boundaries.</p><p>I used to let my clients say anything they wanted to me. If their need to be angry is that urgent, I thought, let them learn anger with me. Now I sacrifice myself for no one. If a client says something that hurts, I set a limit. Clients can be angry with me, and they can tell me so, but meanness and hostility advance neither the relationship nor the individual. If I let someone abuse me verbally, I have done neither one of us a favor.</p><p>The same is true for you. When you let someone abuse you or hurt you verbally, the other person is not advanced. Protecting yourself sets a necessary limit for both of you. That limit advances the relationship.</p><p>We have spiritual boundaries. You are the only one who knows the right spiritual path for yourself. If someone tries to tell you he knows the only way you can believe, he's out of line. "You must work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." (Philippians 2:12, New EngliSh Bible) We can be assisted but not forced. Our spiritual development comes from our inner selves.</p><p>We have sexual boundaries, limits on what is safe and appropriate sexual behavior from others. We have a choice about who we interact with sexually and the extent of that interaction.</p><p>We have relational boundaries. The roles we play define the limits of appropriate interaction with others.</p><p>In later chapters, we'll explore and further define these kinds of boundaries. But why so much talk about boundaries? Why are they so important?.</p><p>Boundaries bring order to our lives. As we learn to strong then our boundaries, we gain a clearer sense of ourselves and our relationship to others. Boundaries empower us to determine bow we'll be treated by others, With good boundaries, we can have the wonderful assurance that comes from knowing we can and will protect ourselves from the ignorance, meanness, or thoughtlessness of others.</p><p><b>Touching Tells Us Where We Begin and End</b></p><p>How do we develop boundaries?

He heard nothing at first, then, again a <em>crunch</em>, <em>crunch</em>, like feet walking on straw. Then it stopped. He looked around the room in the dim light and saw that he was alone. <em>Maybe it was my imagination,</em> he thought and dozed off into a light sleep again. Then he heard the sound again and a light bumping noise. He looked slowly and silently around his room, first at the wall and the window, then, straining to see his door, he noted that it was still bolted. Nothing there. He looked at the back wall where the loom stood. He saw nothing unusual, yet there was the sound again. It was coming from the area of the room where the cubical stood that held his scrolls of Scripture. His eyes remained on the spot as the morning light slowly revealed the scene. The velvet covering had fallen to the floor. His scrolls were all in their place, except for one. It was pulled out a few centimeters and was being gnawed and eaten by a large rat. </p> <p>A low moan started in Saul's throat, and as the sound became audible, the rat stopped eating and raised its head, turning its black eyes upon Saul. Saul got up slowly. The rat didn't move. Saul reached down to the floor and picked up one of his sandals. He raised it over his head and with a grunt threw it at the rat. The rat leaped to the floor and disappeared. The sandal knocked another one of the scrolls to the floor. </p> <p>The rat was under the loom now, and Saul crept across the floor, pushed the loom over, and leaped with his bare feet down on the hard rock floor where the rat had been. He looked around the room, trying to decide where the rat had hidden. His cloak lay on the floor by the bed. He danced upon it, but the rat wasn't there. Embarrassed at himself, he turned again to survey the room. The vile rodent had to be near the basket and spindle. He slowly crept up and kicked the basket. The rat jumped out, but out with it came a mass of fibers its feet had become entangled in. The rat leaped left and right, sideways and upside down in a frenzy to free itself, but it only succeeded in entangling itself more. Saul watched it squirm as it bound itself in a web of cotton. He slipped on a sandal and pressed the rat down on the floor with his foot. The monster shrieked and clawed, trying to free itself. He looked down at his head with hatred, deciding just how to kill it. </p> <p>Just as he was about to take its life, he remembered. "The filthy thing has shreds of the sacred Scriptures in its stomach," Saul said aloud to himself. He paused.<em> It must die,</em> he thought, but still he couldn't crush it, thinking of the precious scroll. "What a horrible visitation upon me," he whispered, standing on one foot and holding the rat down with the other. "What, O Lord, is the meaning of this?" he moaned. "I spend all my waking hours on your holy Word, and a messenger of Satan, a . . . a veritable demon of hell steals in while I sleep." </p> <p>He stood thinking for a long time, then finally reached down and put his thumb and fingers firmly behind the rat's head. He picked it up and broke it and its wrapping free from the rest of the mass. He opened the door and flung the live rat, tied just as it was, far out into the street. He didn't watch to see if the rat escaped from its bondage; he just closed the door and bolted it. </p> <p>The room was a shambles. First Saul picked up the scroll that had fallen to the floor and examined it in the light under the window. It was the book of the prophet Isaiah. Unrolling its two rollers, he discovered that there was a bend and a small rip in the parchment where his sandal had hit it. <em>I could have it repaired by a Torah scribe,</em> he thought. He had copied the scrolls himself years ago, writing with a stylus on parchment. The ink he had made by mixing cypress with lamp black. If he had only remembered to use oil of wormwood in the ink mixture, the bitterness would have discouraged rodents and insects from eating the scrolls. </p> <p>He examined the other damaged scroll carefully and saw that the rodent had indeed eaten a part of it. He opened up the scroll of Chronicles and laid it across the table. Even though some of the text was missing, Saul knew the passage well. The words were a thousand years old--God's promise to Solomon--"If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and will heal their land." </p> <p>God made these promises to Israel during the Feast of Tabernacles at the dedication of the Temple Solomon had built, the first great Temple that had stood where the greater Temple now stood. Accompanying these promises was a warning: "If you observe my statutes and my judgments, I will establish the throne of your kingdom . . . But if you turn away . . . and serve other gods . . ." </p> <p>The rat had done more damage than he thought as he unrolled the scroll further, gently pushing the parchment across the table. "This house which I have sanctified for my name will I cast out of my sight. And it will be a proverb and a byword among all nations . . . Because they have forsaken the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt . . ." </p> <p>He moaned at the desecration of the Holy Scriptures, the horrid toothmarks on the scroll. </p> <p>"The holy Temple of the Most High shall never fall," he said. "His service and his house are my life, my daily portion, my daily service." </p> <p>He rolled the scroll back up and placed it carefully and lovingly back in the cubicle. It took awhile to put the loom, basket, and spindle back in order. Having done this, he went to the basin and washed himself all over, brushed his hair and his beard, and put on a clean loincloth and tunic. He faced in the direction of the Temple, where the sun rising over Mt. Nebo was beginning to bathe its pinnacles in a golden glow. Then he began his morning prayers. It was to be a long, troubled day. </p> <p> </p> <p>Jonathan ben Annas, the high priest, looked down at the young Pharisee who stood before him. He was a small man; his hair and short curly beard were auburn, but his dark eyes under heavy black eyebrows were alive and piercing. Saul of Tarsus had brought before the Sanhedrin another prisoner charged with blasphemy. Only forty-two members of the Sanhedrin were present. Many had excused themselves, claiming other business rather than hearing the case against and deciding the fate of yet another follower of the crucified Nazarene. </p> <p>Since the last days of Herod, the Temple at Jerusalem was watched over by what the Jews called "the evil eye in the sky"--the perpetual presence of Roman guards who stood watch atop the fortress Antonia at the northwest corner of the Temple complex. This fortress could barrack as many as a thousand soldiers. Adjacent to one side of the fortress were stables for the soldiers' Syrian horses. The Roman governor, Marcellus, was afforded every luxury that his office and position allowed. His hall of justice was on the main floor under the tower with business offices and chambers around it. Underneath the justice hall was the prison, a dark, musky, vile-smelling nightmare almost as large as the barracks itself. Into this dungeon were thrown the rabble of Jerusalem, the drunks, thieves, and rebels, anyone who wouldn't bow to Roman law, and captured Zealots, those awaiting trial for active organized resistance to Roman rule in Judea. </p> <p>On a balcony on the side of the great hall that touched the Temple wall were two huge iron doors at which ten Roman soldiers always stood guard. Beyond these doors was a hallway through the wall, a no-man's-land forty cubits long that led to another pair of huge iron doors that opened into the Temple area. The hall through the Temple wall was cut by Herod, and the pious spat in disgust at the sound of his name. They could never forget that the holy Temple of God was defiled on the northwest corner by the presence of the hated Romans. Their tower could even be seen from a portion of the open sacrificial court. Inside the second pair of iron doors was a large balcony from which seventy wide steps descended into the Court of the People and onto the Temple complex. </p> <p>On feast days and other holidays, this giant Temple rectangle accommodated enormous throngs of pilgrims. Its outside walls were eight hundred cubits long. Made of precision-cut white stone blocks, the walls were eighty cubits high and forty cubits thick. The Temple in Jerusalem was the center of worship and sacrifice, yet very few people were ever in the area of the steps that led up to the guarded doors. A Jew would consider himself unclean if he set foot on the pavement of the fortress Antonia. </p> <p>The Temple building nearest to these steps was the hall Gazith, the Palace of Hewn Stone, or the council chamber of the Sanhedrin. The Jews wanted to believe that the Sanhedrin was the highest court of all, but there was no denying that Roman officials had supreme power, even over routing Jewish affairs if they chose to become involved. The installation of a high priest as head of this council was automatically approved by the Roman governor if the man elected was willing to adhere to Roman military and civil policy. </p> <p>The Sanhedrin sat in session daily except on the Sabbath and holy days, governing the religious order of Jews; its decisions and pronouncements were adhered to not only by the Jews of Judea but by those dispersed throughout the empire as well. In this chamber the seventy-two members voted to, or not to, allocate funds from the Temple treasury for various projects and charities. Malefactors were judged before this body of men; suits were decided and judgment pronounced. </p> <p>Behind Saul stood a man called Stephen. He was barefoot, and apparently the only garment he had on was the rough goat-hair robe he wore. He stood perfectly still, and though his beardless chin was caked with dried blood and a large blue bruise was evident on his cheek, ...</p></p><h2>City of Glass (3) (The Mortal Instruments)</h2><p>Love is a mortal sin, and the secrets of the past are deadly.

The weather might have warmed up, but the wind off the East River could still be brutal. It carried with it a faint chemical smell, mixed with the Brooklyn smell of asphalt, gasoline, and burned sugar from the abandoned factory down the street.<br> <br>Simon was waiting for her on the front porch, sprawled in a broken-springed armchair. He had his DS balanced on his blue-jeaned knees and was poking away at it industriously with the stylus. &#x201c;Score,&#x201d; he said as she came up the steps. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m kicking butt at Mario Kart.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary pushed her hood back, shaking hair out of her eyes, and rummaged in her pocket for her keys. &#x201c;Where have you been? I&#x2019;ve been calling you all morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon got to his feet, shoving the blinking rectangle into his messenger bag. &#x201c;I was at Eric&#x2019;s. Band practice.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary stopped jiggling the key in the lock&#x2014;it always stuck&#x2014;long enough to frown at him. &#x201c;Band practice? You mean you&#x2019;re still&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the band? Why wouldn&#x2019;t I be?&#x201d; He reached around her. &#x201c;Here, let me do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary stood still while Simon expertly twisted the key with just the right amount of pressure, making the stubborn old lock spring open. His hand brushed hers; his skin was cool, the temperature of the air outside. She shivered a little. They&#x2019;d only called off their attempt at a romantic relationship last week, and she still felt confused whenever she saw him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; She took the key back without looking at him.<br> <br>It was hot in the living room. Clary hung her jacket up on the peg inside the front hall and headed to the spare bedroom, Simon trailing in her wake. She frowned. Her suitcase was open like a clamshell on the bed, her clothes and sketchbooks strewn everywhere.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you were just going to be in Idris a couple of days,&#x201d; Simon said, taking in the mess with a look of faint dismay.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am, but I can&#x2019;t figure out what to pack. I hardly own any dresses or skirts, but what if I can&#x2019;t wear pants there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t you be able to wear pants there? It&#x2019;s another country, not another century.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But the Shadowhunters are so old-fashioned, and Isabelle always wears dresses&#x2014;&#x201d; Clary broke off and sighed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing. I&#x2019;m just projecting all my anxiety about my mom onto my wardrobe. Let&#x2019;s talk about something else. How was practice? Still no band name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was fine.&#x201d; Simon hopped onto the desk, legs dangling over the side. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re considering a new motto. Something ironic, like &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve seen a million faces and rocked about eighty percent of them.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you told Eric and the rest of them that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That I&#x2019;m a vampire? No. It isn&#x2019;t the sort of thing you just drop into casual conversation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe not, but they&#x2019;re your friends. They should know. And besides, they&#x2019;ll just think it makes you more of a rock god, like that vampire Lester.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lestat,&#x201d; Simon said. &#x201c;That would be the vampire Lestat. And he&#x2019;s fictional. Anyway, I don&#x2019;t see you running to tell all your friends that you&#x2019;re a Shadowhunter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What friends? You&#x2019;re my friend.&#x201d; She threw herself down onto the bed and looked up at Simon. &#x201c;And I told you, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because you had no choice.&#x201d; Simon put his head to the side, studying her; the bedside light reflected off his eyes, turning them silver. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss you while you&#x2019;re gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss you, too,&#x201d; Clary said, although her skin was prickling all over with a nervous anticipation that made it hard to concentrate. I&#x2019;m going to Idris! her mind sang. I&#x2019;ll see the Shadow-hunter home country, the City of Glass. I&#x2019;ll save my mother.<br> <br>And I&#x2019;ll be with Jace.<br> <br>Simon&#x2019;s eyes flashed as if he could hear her thoughts, but his voice was soft. &#x201c;Tell me again&#x2014;why do you have to go to Idris? Why can&#x2019;t Madeleine and Luke take care of this without you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My mom got the spell that put her in this state from a warlock&#x2014;Ragnor Fell. Madeleine says we need to track him down if we want to know how to reverse the spell. But he doesn&#x2019;t know Madeleine. He knew my mom, and Madeleine thinks he&#x2019;ll trust me because I look so much like her. And Luke can&#x2019;t come with me. He could come to Idris, but apparently he can&#x2019;t get into Alicante without permission from the Clave, and they won&#x2019;t give it. And don&#x2019;t say anything about it to him, please&#x2014;he&#x2019;s really not happy about not going with me. If he hadn&#x2019;t known Madeleine before, I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d let me go at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But the Lightwoods will be there too. And Jace. They&#x2019;ll be helping you. I mean, Jace did say he&#x2019;d help you, didn&#x2019;t he? He doesn&#x2019;t mind you coming along?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, he&#x2019;ll help me,&#x201d; Clary said. &#x201c;And of course he doesn&#x2019;t mind. He&#x2019;s fine with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>But that, she knew, was a lie.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Clary had gone straight to the Institute after she&#x2019;d talked to Madeleine at the hospital. Jace had been the first one she&#x2019;d told her mother&#x2019;s secret to, before even Luke. And he&#x2019;d stood there and stared at her, getting paler and paler as she spoke, as if she weren&#x2019;t so much telling him how she could save her mother as draining the blood out of him with cruel slowness.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going,&#x201d; he said as soon as she&#x2019;d finished. &#x201c;If I have to tie you up and sit on you until this insane whim of yours passes, you are not going to Idris.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary felt as if he&#x2019;d slapped her. She had thought he&#x2019;d be pleased. She&#x2019;d run all the way from the hospital to the Institute to tell him, and here he was standing in the entryway glaring at her with a look of grim death. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re going.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, we&#x2019;re going. We have to go. The Clave&#x2019;s called every active Clave member who can be spared back to Idris for a massive Council meeting. They&#x2019;re going to vote on what to do about Valentine, and since we&#x2019;re the last people who&#x2019;ve seen him&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary brushed this aside. &#x201c;So if you&#x2019;re going, why can&#x2019;t I go with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>The straightforwardness of the question seemed to make him even angrier. &#x201c;Because it isn&#x2019;t safe for you there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, and it&#x2019;s so safe here? I&#x2019;ve nearly been killed a dozen times in the past month, and every time it&#x2019;s been right here in New York.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because Valentine&#x2019;s been concentrating on the two Mortal Instruments that were here.&#x201d; Jace spoke through gritted teeth. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to shift his focus to Idris now, we all know it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re hardly as certain of anything as all that,&#x201d; said Maryse Lightwood. She had been standing in the shadow of the corridor doorway, unseen by either of them; she moved forward now, into the harsh entryway lights. They illuminated the lines of exhaustion that seemed to draw her face down. Her husband, Robert Lightwood, had been injured by demon poison during the battle last week and had needed constant nursing since; Clary could only imagine how tired she must be. &#x201c;And the Clave wants to meet Clarissa. You know that, Jace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Clave can screw itself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jace,&#x201d; Maryse said, sounding genuinely parental for a change. &#x201c;Language.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Clave wants a lot of things,&#x201d; Jace amended. &#x201c;It shouldn&#x2019;t necessarily get them all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maryse shot him a look, as if she knew exactly what he was talking about and didn&#x2019;t appreciate it. &#x201c;The Clave is often right, Jace. It&#x2019;s not unreasonable for them to want to talk to Clary, after what she&#x2019;s been through. What she could tell them&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell them whatever they want to know,&#x201d; Jace said.<br> <br>Maryse sighed and turned her blue eyes on Clary. &#x201c;So you want to go to Idris, I take it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just for a few days. I won&#x2019;t be any trouble,&#x201d; Clary said, gazing entreatingly past Jace&#x2019;s white-hot glare at Maryse. &#x201c;I swear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The question isn&#x2019;t whether you&#x2019;ll be any trouble; the question is whether you&#x2019;ll be willing to meet with the Clave while you&#x2019;re there. They want to talk to you. If you say no, I doubt we can get the authorization to bring you with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No&#x2014;,&#x201d; Jace began.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll meet with the Clave,&#x201d; Clary interrupted, though the thought sent a ripple of cold down her spine. The only emissary of the Clave she&#x2019;d known so far was the Inquisitor, who hadn&#x2019;t exactly been pleasant to be around.<br> <br>Maryse rubbed at her temples with her fingertips. &#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s settled.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t sound settled, though; she sounded as tense and fragile as an overtightened violin string. &#x201c;Jace, show Clary out and then come see me in the library. I need to talk to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She disappeared back into the shadows without even a word of farewell. Clary stared after her, feeling as if she&#x2019;d just been drenched with ice water. Alec and Isabelle seemed genuinely fond of their mother, and she was sure Maryse wasn&#x2019;t a bad person, really, but she wasn&#x2019;t exactly warm.<br> <br>Jace&#x2019;s mouth was a hard line. &#x201c;Now look what you&#x2019;ve done.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I need to go to Idris, even if you can&#x2019;t understand why,&#x201d; Clary said. &#x201c;I need to do this for my mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maryse trusts the Clave too much,&#x201d; said Jace. &#x201c;She has to believe they&#x2019;re perfect, and I can&#x2019;t tell her they aren&#x2019;t, because&#x2014;&#x201d; He stopped abruptly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s something Valentine would say.&#x201d;<br> <br>She expected an explosion, but &#x201c;No one is perfect&#x201d; was all he said. He reached out and stabbed at the elevator button with his index finger. &#x201c;Not even the Clave.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary crossed her arms over her chest. &#x201c;Is that really why you don&#x2019;t want me to come? Because it isn&#x2019;t safe?&#x201d;<br> <br>A flicker of surprise crossed his face. &#x201c;What do you mean? Why else wouldn&#x2019;t I want you to come?&#x201d;<br> <br>She swallowed. &#x201c;Because&#x2014;&#x201d; Because you told me you don&#x2019;t have feelings for me anymore, and you see, that&#x2019;s very awkward, because I still have them for you. And I bet you know it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I don&#x2019;t want my little sister following me everywhere?&#x201d; There was a sharp note in his voice, half mockery, half something else.<br> <br>The elevator arrived with a clatter. Pushing the gate aside, Clary stepped into it and turned to face Jace. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going because you&#x2019;ll be there. I&#x2019;m going because I want to help my mother. Our mother. I have to help her. Don&#x2019;t you get it? If I don&#x2019;t do this, she might never wake up. You could at least pretend you care a little bit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace put his hands on her shoulders, his fingertips brushing the bare skin at the edge of her collar, sending pointless, helpless shivers through her nerves. There were shadows below his eyes, Clary noticed without wanting to, and dark hollows under his cheekbones. The black sweater he was wearing only made his bruise-marked skin stand out more, and the dark lashes, too; he was a study in contrasts, something to be painted in shades of black, white, and gray, with splashes of gold here and there, like his eyes, for an accent color&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me do it.&#x201d; His voice was soft, urgent. &#x201c;I can help her for you. Tell me where to go, who to ask. I&#x2019;ll get what you need.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Madeleine told the warlock I&#x2019;d be the one coming. He&#x2019;ll be expecting Jocelyn&#x2019;s daughter, not Jocelyn&#x2019;s son.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace&#x2019;s hands tightened on her shoulders. &#x201c;So tell her there was a change of plans. I&#x2019;ll be going, not you. Not you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jace&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do whatever,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Whatever you want, if you promise to stay here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>He let go of her, as if she&#x2019;d pushed him away. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;she&#x2019;s my mother, Jace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And mine.&#x201d; His voice was cold. &#x201c;In fact, why didn&#x2019;t Madeleine approach both of us about this? Why just you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know why.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; he said, and this time he sounded even colder, &#x201c;to her you&#x2019;re Jocelyn&#x2019;s daughter. But I&#x2019;ll always be Valentine&#x2019;s son.&#x201d;<br> <br>He slammed the gate shut between them. For a moment she stared at him through it&#x2014;the mesh of the gate divided up his face into a series of diamond shapes, outlined in metal. A single golden eye stared at her through one diamond, furious anger flickering in its depths.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jace&#x2014;,&#x201d; she began.<br> <br>But with a jerk and a clatter, the elevator was already moving, carrying her down into the dark silence of the cathedral.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>&#x201c;Earth to Clary.&#x201d; Simon waved his hands at her. &#x201c;You awake?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, sorry.&#x201d; She sat up, shaking her head to clear it of cobwebs. That had been the last time she&#x2019;d seen Jace. He hadn&#x2019;t picked up the phone when she&#x2019;d called him afterward, so she&#x2019;d made all her plans to travel to Idris with the Lightwoods using Alec as reluctant and embarrassed point person. Poor Alec, stuck between Jace and his mother, always trying to do the right thing. &#x201c;Did you say something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just that I think Luke is back,&#x201d; Simon said, and jumped off the desk just as the bedroom door opened. &#x201c;And he is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Simon.&#x201d; Luke sounded calm, maybe a little tired&#x2014;he was wearing a battered denim jacket, a flannel shirt, and old cords tucked into boots that looked like they&#x2019;d seen their best days ten years ago. His glasses were pushed up into his brown hair, which seemed flecked with more gray now than Clary remembered. There was a square package under his arm, tied with a length of green ribbon. He held it out to Clary. &#x201c;I got you something for your trip.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to do that!&#x201d; Clary protested. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve done so much. . . .&#x201d; She thought of the clothes he&#x2019;d bought her after everything she owned had been destroyed. He&#x2019;d given her a new phone, new art supplies, without ever having to be asked. Almost everything she owned now was a gift from Luke. And you don&#x2019;t even approve of the fact that I&#x2019;m going. That last thought hung unspoken between them.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know. But I saw it, and I thought of you.&#x201d; He handed over the box.<br> <br>The object inside was swathed in layers of tissue paper. Clary tore through it, her hand seizing on something soft as kitten&#x2019;s fur. She gave a little gasp. It was a bottle-green velvet coat, old-fashioned, with a gold silk lining, brass buttons, and a wide hood. She drew it onto her lap, smoothing her hands lovingly down the soft material. &#x201c;It looks like something Isabelle would wear,&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;Like a Shadowhunter traveling cloak.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly. Now you&#x2019;ll be dressed more like one of them,&#x201d; Luke said. &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re in Idris.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked up at him. &#x201c;Do you want me to look like one of them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Clary, you are one of them.&#x201d; His smile was tinged with sadness. &#x201c;Besides, you know how they treat outsiders. Anything you can do to fit in . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon made an odd noise, and Clary looked guiltily at him&#x2014;she&#x2019;d almost forgotten he was there. He was looking studiously at his watch. &#x201c;I should go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you just got here!&#x201d; Clary protested. &#x201c;I thought we could hang out, watch a movie or something&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You need to pack.&#x201d; Simon smiled, bright as sunshine after rain. She could almost believe there was nothing bothering him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come by later to say good-bye before you go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on,&#x201d; Clary protested. &#x201c;Stay&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; His tone was final. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m meeting Maia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. Great,&#x201d; Clary said. Maia, she told herself, was nice. She was smart. She was pretty. She was also a werewolf. A werewolf with a crush on Simon. But maybe that was as it should be. Maybe his new friend should be a Downworlder. After all, he was a Downworlder himself now. Technically, he shouldn&#x2019;t even be spending time with Shadowhunters like Clary. &#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;d better go, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;d better.&#x201d; Simon&#x2019;s dark eyes were unreadable. This was new&#x2014;she&#x2019;d always been able to read Sim...</p><h2>Tease Monster: A Book About Teasing vs. Bullying (Building Relationships)</h2><p>When One-of-a-Kind&#x201d;is laughed at by Purple for being weird and Green playfully calls One a klutz after tripping on the stairs, is the Tease Monster to blame?

This the newest book in the Building Relationships series by Julia Cook.</p><p>Julia Cook, a former teacher and school counselor, writes books for children that let them laugh while learning to solve their own problems, use better behavior, and develop healthy relationships. She has authored more than 30 books for children and teachers. She has received the Association for Educational Publishers Distinguished Achievement Award, and her books have been honored by The National Parenting Center and Mom&#39;s Choice Awards.Author Julia Cook has a phenomenal gift of writing books for children! Her books teach important life skills and are written through a child&#39;s view of the world. As an Elementary School Counselor, I have incorporated many of Julia&#39;s books into my curriculum and must say Tease Monster is a powerful relationship-building tool. Children will quickly learn the power of words, how people hear things in different ways, and the importance of laughing with someone not at them. Tease Monster should certainly find its way onto your bookshelf if you&#39;re a parent, school counselor, teacher, social worker, psychologist, or pediatrician. --Erin E.

Finally. And, according to the entire real estate industry, not a moment too soon.</p><p>For the past decade, since the Great Recession forced so many Americans to put their lives on hold, the world of real estate has been praying for the arrival of Millennials on the home buying scene to begin buying, selling, fixing up, and financing property. It&#x2019;s been quite the waiting game: when I first started writing about real estate, the average age of a first-time&nbsp;home buyer was 26. Today, it&#x2019;s nearly 34.</p><p>There are a lot of explanations for the delay: Millennials who graduated from college in 2008 to 2012 found a weak job market. Many of them moved home instead of moving out with a friend (or by themselves) and renting their own place, typically a precursor to home buying. Roughly a third of them are still living at home. Older Millennials watched as parents lost jobs, tapped their 401(k)s to survive, and took jobs that paid less (and often didn&#x2019;t offer benefits), and their families struggled to make ends meet. Millions of homeowners couldn&#x2019;t sell when they needed to and lost their homes to foreclosure, destroying credit histories and confidence in the process. When you lose confidence in yourself and your ability to pay the bills, it&#x2019;s awfully hard to make the commitment to buying something as large and as permanent as a house.</p><p>But Millennials also have cash flow issues, thanks to their student loan problem. About 44 million Americans are paying off student loans these days, to the tune of $1.4 trillion total. The average amount of student loan debt has tripled over the past twenty years, and most 2017 graduates were carrying about $36,000 worth of student loans as they made their way out of college and into their adult lives. Here are some facts about Millennials and student loan debt that make the real estate industry very nervous:</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Some 58 percent of college graduates&#x2020; reported having student loans; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;44 percent don&#x2019;t know the difference between private and federal loans; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;45 percent don&#x2019;t know what percentage of their budget goes toward paying down student loans;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;37 percent don&#x2019;t know what interest rate their loans carry; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;15 percent don&#x2019;t even know how much they owe; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Default rates are running between 7 and just over 11 percent, depending on the type of loan and whether the school was private or public, according to the Department of Education.<br><br>For those Millennials who are making their payments, paying off student loans can delay home buying because monthly debt service payments are deducted from the amount someone has available to repay debts. That, as we&#x2019;ll discuss later in the financing section of the book, leaves you less income to qualify under the government&#x2019;s Ability to Repay rules.<p>Finally, one of the great drivers of homeownership is the next generation. Along with everything else, Millennials have time-shifted marriage and children. They&#x2019;re marrying later than any generation and having kids when they&#x2019;re older. If you&#x2019;re single, or even if you&#x2019;re in a long-term relationship but without kids, you&#x2019;re probably not looking for a house in the suburbs with a good school district. And, because you&#x2019;re changing jobs fairly frequently, having a longer-term commitment to real estate isn&#x2019;t particularly high on the list.</p><p>But times they are a-changing. According to the latest figures from the National Association of Realtors, Millennials accounted for 34 percent of home buyers in 2016, the latest year for which data is available. And almost all of them were buying homes for the first time.</p><p><b>Who Are Millennial Home Buyers?</b></p><p>According to the Pew Research Center, Millennials (81 million of them) are those individuals born in 1981 and later, up until today. But other researchers cap the era of Millennials at those born between 1981 or 1982 and 1994 or 1995, which would put the youngest Millennials at around age 22 or 23 (as I write this), up until about age 36 or 37. That makes sense to me, since I see Generation Z (the generation younger than the Millennials) as a next-gen group that some are already calling Digital Natives. (I tend to refer to them as &#x201c;the generation born with a chip built into their brain.&#x201d;) In short, the oldest Millennials will remember life before Google and what a telephone&#x2019;s busy signal sounded like. Gen Z (including my own kids) won&#x2019;t.</p><p>Around the world, Millennials are considered one of the most consistent generations. Much of this has to do with the Internet; this cohort is the most tech-savvy, and technology has flattened much of the world. Information flows freely, is adapted to life seamlessly, and has profoundly (and quickly) changed life for them and their parents. It&#x2019;s certainly changed how people shop for, buy, sell, finance, and invest in real estate.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, according to the 2016 Survey of Home Buyers and Sellers, an annual report published by the National Association of Realtors, first-time buyers fall directly into the Millennial sweet spot:</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;They&#x2019;re a median 32 years old. (All home buyers lumped together are a median 44 years old.) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Their median income is $72,000. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;The median price of a first-time buyer&#x2019;s home purchase is $182,500, although that ranges from just about $161,000 for unmarried couples to $208,500 for married first-time buyers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;72 percent are married, or an unmarried couple. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;6 percent is the median down payment. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;60 percent have no children. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;95 percent either rent or live with their parents before buying their first home. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;1 percent purchase the home they had previously rented. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;87 percent were born in the USA.<p>Is this you? Then you might be ready to buy your first home (even if you don&#x2019;t realize it yet).</p><p>One of the last things I did as I was sending the first edition of this book off to press in 1993 was get an AOL email. I think AOL had fewer than 100,000 people who were signed up for email at that time, but almost as soon as this book was published in 1994, I started receiving messages from readers. We were the &#x201c;early adopters&#x201d; of our generation. Then, no one would have thought to look for a house online (the early photos were black-and-white shots of the front of houses, basically reused from listing books that were typically published every two weeks, and jealously protected by real estate companies), much less buy without ever seeing it in person. There was no Google, no Zillow, no Trulia, no agent websites to speak of. (What did happen, in 1993, is that mortgage interest rates dropped below 7 percent for the first time since World War II, and basically haven&#x2019;t gone back above 6 percent for more than a few months since.)</p><p>How far we&#x2019;ve come. Today&#x2019;s Millennial home buyers have demanded tremendous and continuous technological change from Realtors, lenders, and others in the real estate community. You can do just about everything you need to do to shop for, buy, and close on a home with your phone, including download and read a digital copy of this book (and link to ThinkGlink.com/first-time- buyer for updates). That&#x2019;s still tough for your Baby</p><p>Boomer brokers to get their heads around. The tech world has delivered, and made billions of dollars in the process.</p><p>So, it&#x2019;s never been easier to find, buy, and finance the right house: as long as you have great credit, sizable savings, little or no debt, and plenty of income. And that&#x2019;s where first-time buyers typically fall short. Since the Great Recession, millions of homes have been swooped up by investors. Prices have risen 41 percent in 5 years (2011&#x2013;16), while incomes have only risen 11 percent. Interest rates seem poised to rise above 4 percent for a thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage (and were briefly above that at the beginning of 2017, before falling back). Affordability is worse.</p><p>With these changes come new (and important) questions you should be asking as you set out to explore the world of homeownership: Should you buy a home now or rent? Should you buy with someone or on your own? Is your job (and income) stable over the next five to ten years? Should I spend every last dollar the mortgage lender says I can?</p><p>To borrow a phrase from Oprah, here are some things about the residential I know for sure:</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Over the past 25 years, homes have appreciated in value. Not every home, and not everywhere, but for the vast majority of Americans in much of the United States. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Twenty-five years from now, the real estate market as a whole will be worth substantially more than it is today. Buy smart and you&#x2019;ll not only have a better quality of life, but you&#x2019;ll enrich yourself and your family. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;That&#x2019;s because a home continues to be the centerpiece of a family net worth. Every mortgage payment you make is like enforced savings. (When you rent, you&#x2019;re paying the mortgage of the investor.) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;And finally, the younger you are when you buy your first home, the wealthier you&#x2019;ll be later in life.<p>Let&#x2019;s get started.</p></p><h2>Cancer Secrets: An Integrative Oncologist Reveals How You Can Defeat Cancer Using the Best of Modern Medicine and Alternative Therapies</h2><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, and will soon overtake heart disease as the #1 killer. This year alone in the United States, there will be 1.7 million new cancer cases, and over 600,000 cancer deaths. The lifetime risk of developing cancer is now 1 in 3 people, and is quickly approaching 1 in 2. Despite billions of dollars devoted to cancer research, we are no closer to a cure. Sadly, we are losing the war on cancer. Patients diagnosed with cancer, as well as their family and friends, are left with a difficult decision: do I follow the standard of care, consisting of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, or do I seek alternative treatments on my own? Do I listen to my doctor, or do I follow advice from the internet? Who do I listen to? Who can I trust? Until now, cancer patients and their families did not have a reliable resource for optimally treating cancer. In this breakthrough book, Cancer Secrets, you will learn critical information about what cancer is (and is not) and how to best treat it using the best that both modern medicine and alternative medicine have to offer. Integrative oncologist, Jonathan Stegall, MD, provides a long-awaited and much-needed remedy for our cancer problem.

In Colors, some spreads incorporate a single object such as an apple or flower, while others use the same shape to depict two different objects. For example, an orange sunset on the left and an orange slice on the right are both created out of the same semicircle. However, it should be noted that the shade of orange used is not easily distinguished from the red on the preceding page. Typical couplings such as "Outside/Inside," "Night/Day," and "Small/Big" are included in Opposites, along with more peculiar pairings such as "Caged/Free," showing a tearful lion behind bars on one side and the bars lifted on the other. Some of the opposites that might not come naturally to young children include "Heavy [an elephant]/Light [a cloud]." The motto of these French imports is "to touch is to experience; to experience is to learn." Children will certainly be drawn to the bright, appealing, and touchable illustrations, but the flaws in the execution of the concepts make the books additional purchases.-Rachel Kamin, North Suburban Synagogue Beth El, Highland Park, IL&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Two hours I sat there on the sand&#x2014;no Malley. In the beginning it was just annoying, but after a while I began to worry that something was wrong.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>My cousin, in spite of her issues, is a punctual person.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I kept calling her cell phone but it went straight to her voice mail, which was Malley chortling in a British accent: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the loo. Ring you back later!&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t leave a message, and I didn&#x2019;t text, either.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In case somebody else had her phone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Somebody like her dad, who&#x2019;s my uncle. He takes away Malley&#x2019;s cell like twice a week as punishment for acting up, acting out, whatever. Still, even when she&#x2019;s in trouble at home, she always finds a way to sneak out to the beach.<br>&nbsp;<br>A few turtle people were scouting the shoreline, waggling their flashlights. I walked north, as Malley and I usu- ally did. We&#x2019;d never seen a turtle actually laying her eggs, but we&#x2019;d found several nests. The first thing you notice is the flipper tracks leading up from the water&#x2019;s edge. Loggerheads, hawksbills and green turtles leave trenches like a mini&#x2013;dune buggy when they drag their heavy shells across the sand.<br>&nbsp;<br>After the mother turtle finishes depositing her eggs, she covers them with a loose, churned mound. Every time that Malley and I came across one, we&#x2019;d call the state wildlife office and they would send an officer to mark it.<br>&nbsp;<br>First, wooden stakes are tapped into the sand to create a rectangular perimeter outside the mound; then hot-pink ribbons are strung from one stake to the next. You can go to jail for messing with a turtle nest, so the officers put up a warning sign. Still, every so often some random idiot gets caught stealing the eggs, which are sold as a romantic ingredient in certain places.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pathetic but true.<br>The phone chirped, but it wasn&#x2019;t a text from Malley; it was my mom asking where the heck I was. I texted her that I was still down by the water, and that no savage criminals had tried to snatch me. Afterwards I tried Malley&#x2019;s number once more, but she didn&#x2019;t pick up.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I walked on alone until I came to a marked nest that I didn&#x2019;t remember seeing the last time Malley and I were there. The dig was new and soft. I picked a spot outside the warning ribbon and sat down holding my baseball bat, which Mom makes me carry for protection whenever I go to the beach after dark. It&#x2019;s an Easton aluminum model left over from when I played Little League. I feel dorky carrying it, but Mom won&#x2019;t let me out of the house if I don&#x2019;t. Too many creeps in the world, she says.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The slanted moonlight made the waves look like curls of pink gold. I lay back, folded my arms behind my head and closed my eyes. The wind was easing, and I heard a train blow its horn to the west, on the mainland.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That wasn&#x2019;t all. I heard the sound of breathing, too, and it wasn&#x2019;t my own.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>At first I thought:&nbsp;<i>Turtle</i>. The breaths were damp and shallow, like air being forced through a broken whistle.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I sat up and looked around: No sign of tracks. Maybe it was an old bobcat, watching me from the dunes. Or a raccoon&#x2014;they like to dig up loggerhead nests and chow down the eggs. I slapped the Easton in the palm of my left hand, which stung. The noise was sharp enough to scare off most critters, but it didn&#x2019;t frighten whatever was breathing nearby.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Leaving seemed like a smart idea, but I got only fifty yards before I turned and went back. Whatever I&#x2019;d heard couldn&#x2019;t be very large because otherwise I would have spotted it; there was really no place to hide on an empty beach under a full moon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Approaching the turtle nest again, I put down the Easton and cupped my ears to muffle the sound of the waves. The mysterious breathing seemed to be coming from inside the rectangle of pink ribbons.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Could it be a crab?</i>&nbsp;I wondered. A&nbsp;<i>crab with asthma?&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Because new turtle eggs don&#x2019;t make a peep. That I knew for a fact.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Carefully I stepped over the border of ribbons and crouched on top of the nest. In and out went the raspy noise, slow and even. I leaned closer and saw a striped soda straw sticking out of the sand. Through the exposed end I could feel a puff of warm air whenever the underground creature exhaled.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>No more than three inches of the straw was exposed, but that was enough to pinch between my fingers. When I pulled it out of the mound, the in-and-out noise stopped.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I stood dead still on my heels, waiting for a reaction. Honestly I wasn&#x2019;t trying to suffocate the critter; I just wanted to make it crawl out so I could see what the heck it was. My thought was to take a picture with my phone and text it to Malley.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The world&#x2019;s sneakiest crab, right?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But then, as I was peering at the spot where the soda straw had been, the turtle nest basically exploded. A full-grown man shot upright in a spray of sand, and my heart must have stopped beating for ten seconds.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Built like a grizzly, he was coughing and swearing and spitting through a long, caked beard. On his chiseled block of a head he wore (I swear) a flowered plastic shower cap. Even weirder, his left eye and right eye were pointed in totally different directions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I vaulted back over the ribbon and snatched up my baseball bat.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He said, &#x201c;Get serious, boy.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>After catching my breath, I asked, &#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Gagging, thanks to you.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I tried to apologize but I couldn&#x2019;t put the words together. I was too freaked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have your name,&#x201d; the man said.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;R-R-Richard.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They call you Rick?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ricky? Richie?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Just Richard.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Outstanding,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I like your parents already.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Dude, you can&#x2019;t sleep in a turtle nest!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d you do with my straw?&#x201d; He brushed himself off. I&#x2019;m guessing he stood six four, six five. Large, like I said. He wore a moldy old army jacket and camo pants, and he was clutching a dirty duffel bag.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll put you in jail,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; He wheeled in a full circle, kicking violently at the sand with his boots. I covered my eyes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;See, Richard,&#x201d; he said when he was done, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s not a real turtle nest.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>One by one he yanked up the stakes and tied them together with the pink ribbons. He crammed the whole bundle into his duffel and said, &#x201c;I was waiting on a man.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;While you&#x2019;re buried on a beach?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s meant to be a surprise. His name is Dodge Olney. Digs up turtle eggs and sells them on the black market for two bucks a pop. One night he&#x2019;s gonna dig up me.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Then what?&#x201d; I asked.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He and I will have a chat.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you just call the law?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Olney&#x2019;s been arrested three times for robbing loggerhead nests,&#x201d; the man explained. &#x201c;The jailhouse experience has failed to rehabilitate him. I&#x2019;ll be taking a different approach.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There was no anger in his voice, but the slow way he said the words made me seriously glad not to be Mr. Olney.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Tell me this, Richard. What are you doing out here?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#x2019;t have much experience with homeless persons, so I was sort of sketched out. But he was an old dude, probably the same age as my grandpa, and I decided there was no way he could catch me if I ran.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Looking up and down the shore, I saw that I was on my own. The nearest flashlight beams were a couple hundred yards away&#x2014;more turtle people. There was a row of private houses on the other side of the dunes, so I figured I could take off in that direction, if necessary. Pound on somebody&#x2019;s door and yell for help.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve gotta get going,&#x201d; I said to the stranger.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Excellent idea.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If you see a girl out here about my age? That&#x2019;s my cousin.&#x201d; I wanted him to know, in case he got any crazy ideas. He was aware that in the moonlight I had a good look at his face, those weird eyeballs that didn&#x2019;t match.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You want me to have her call you?&#x201d; he asked.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk to her, please. She&#x2019;ll get scared.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Understandably.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Maybe you should find somewhere else to crash,&#x201d; I said.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He grinned&#x2014;and I mean these were the whitest, brightest, straightest teeth I ever saw. Not what you expect on a grungy old guy who&#x2019;d just popped out of a hole.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Son, I&#x2019;ve walked the whole way from Lauderdale on this hunt, sleeping every night on the beach. That&#x2019;s a hundred and thirty&#x2013;odd miles, and you&#x2019;re the first person to make it an issue.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not an issue,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Just, you know, a suggestion.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, I got one for you: Go home.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; I asked.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So you can give it to the cops? No thanks.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I promised not to call the police, which was true for the moment. The man wasn&#x2019;t breaking any laws, sleeping underground with a straw for a breathing tube. Really he wasn&#x2019;t bothering a soul, and then I came along and riled him up.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The name&#x2019;s Clint Tyree,&#x201d; he told me, &#x201c;although I haven&#x2019;t answered to it in years. Good night, now.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He walked away, along the water&#x2019;s edge. I sat down beside the remains of his fake turtle nest, took out my cell and Googled the name he&#x2019;d given me, just to make sure he wasn&#x2019;t listed on some child-predator site. He wasn&#x2019;t.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He was, however, famous for something else.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When I caught up to him, half a mile down the beach, I told him that Wikipedia said he was dead.</p><h2>Questioning Evangelism: Engaging People&#39;s Hearts the Way Jesus Did</h2><p><b>You don't need to memorize evangelical formulas or answers.

Over the centuries much ink has been spilled on the subject of grace. Yet perhaps nothing is as hard to <i>explain </i>as God's grace. <i>It doesn't make sense. It's not fair.

Right where you are, whoever you are: Newly diagnosed and in shock, praying there&#x2019;s been some mistake. Facing surgery, hoping the doctor can get it all. Holding the hand of a loved one, trying to be strong. Trudging through chemotherapy and radiation, hoping they work. Undergoing tests, longing for good news.<br><br><i>When God &amp; Cancer Meet</i> is a book of powerful stories about cancer patients and their families who have been touched by God in miraculous ways.</p><p>In a seventh-grade journalism class, <b>Lynn Eib</b> decided she wanted to grow up to be a newspaper reporter. Two years later she applied to be the sports editor of her school's weekly paper even though the administration said only boys could have that job. She finally convinced them she knew sports and would stay out of the boys' locker room and got the job. Her love for newspaper reporting never waned and she majored in journalism at the Ohio State University, where she also met the love of her life on her first and last blind date. They married eight months later in 1973 and her husband, Ralph, recently retired after 32 years in pastoral ministry.Lynn has captured the essence of hope in this book; captured hope in ways that I have always taught in my professional world as well as in my spiritual community. This book is a treasure to those who struggle with the fears of cancer and I want to keep it close at hand for those reasons. (Judy Lentz, RN, MSN, OCN, NHA; Executive Director, Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association)<br><br>I co-lead a cancer support group at my church, and we have been looking for &#x201c;just the right book&#x201d; to study and discuss. Guess what?! Lyn wrote it! I was truly touched by all the stories; of course being a cancer-survivor myself, I saw myself in one of the stories, as if Lyn were writing my own personal story. I was truly impressed with the way she incorporated scripture, and God&#x2019;s viewpoint into every story. I think that is of utmost importance for anyone facing this disease. Lyn&#x2019;s book is &#x201c;Real-Life&#x201d;; some quickly are healed of the cancer, some deal with it over a prolonged period, some deal with recurrences, some, mercifully, die rather quickly. I share Lyn&#x2019;s belief that GOD sometimes chooses to heal in different ways: physically, emotionally and spiritually. In the process of surviving a primary brain tumor, surgery, Chemo, and radiation, I gave my life to Christ, realizing that my physical health was not GOD&#x2019;s main concern, my Spiritual health was the biggest victim of a disease that needed attention and this was the way He FINALLY got my attention. Lyn&#x2019;s book alludes to this fact in every one of her stories. In this day and age that we are living, where it is against the rules to even mention GOD (unless we mention His name in vain) it is refreshing to have a book written, praising Him for His care and concern for us; written by a woman who has experienced the disease firsthand, and continues to minister to others with cancer, and to work for a Doctor! who isn&#x2019;t ashamed of his Faith! WOW!! Obviously, Lyn&#x2019;s book has my highest recommendation, and my support group will be purchasing multiple copies, and we plan to invite Lyn to speak with us. Lyn is a wonderful person, and I thank God for allowing our paths to cross. I&#x2019;m sure this book will touch many lives, and give many a new perspective and hope with their cancer.

"They want to be part of something, even when they can't identify that longing as a need. They show up. Feed them. It isn't much more complicated than that."

She's having a party, her mama is making a big cake, and she has a good feeling about a certain wrapped box. Turning ten years old is a big deal to Armani. It means she's older, wiser, more responsible. But when Hurricane Katrina hits the Lower Nines of New Orleans and tears her world apart, Armani realizes that being ten means being brave, watching loved ones die, and mustering all her strength to help her family weather the storm. A gripping story of courage and survival, <em>Upside Down in the Middle of Nowhere</em> celebrates the power of hope and love in the face of the unthinkable.</p><p>Julie T. Lamana lives in Greenwell Springs, Louisiana, and worked in an after-school program for children displaced by Hurricane Katrina, gaining a unique insight into their experiences surviving the storm. This book is a reflection of those experiences.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;Ten-year-old Armani is crushed to learn that her long-anticipated birthday party will be cancelled due to Hurricane Katrina's imminent approach. Her disappointment quickly transforms into terror as the storm hits, separating her from her parents. She must look after her two younger sisters on a journey that takes her first to the Superdome, then to a shelter, and finally back home to the ravaged Lower Ninth Ward. This is a story that will grab avid and reluctant readers alike because of the intensity of its drama. The plot is well constructed, and the cliff-hanger endings of many chapters will ensure rapid page turning. Armani is a fully realized protagonist, and her narrative effectively conveys the novel's mood, offering a sense of foreboding that grows into palpable fear. A well-defined setting, with evocative descriptions of the neighborhood and storm, enhances the story. Lamana handles the gritty details and macabre imagery quite gracefully, and never does the account seem sensationalized. Toward the novel's end, occasional hiccups in flow mar the narrative. The portrayal of some events seems far-fetched and conveniently coincidental. Likewise, the conclusion, though satisfactorily resolved, comes about somewhat awkwardly. However, these flaws are not so grievous as to distract in a meaningful way from the story at hand. Overall, this novel gives readers a realistic and vivid sense of what it may have been like to experience the disaster firsthand.&#x2014;Julie Hanson, Chicago Public Library</p><h2>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The IDW Collection Volume 4 (TMNT IDW Collection)</h2><p><b>Presenting the complete TMNT stories in recommended reading order, including one-shots, crossovers, and event series.

But, fear not, this is not another book that will pile on the guilt, simply saying pray better and more often. Instead, Michael Reeves shows us not only why prayer is so essential, but also how we can enjoy it too. <p></p> <p>Taking his cue from Calvin's definition that 'prayer is the chief exercise of faith,' Reeves helps us understand that prayer should be a natural expression of our faith. Just as faith is awakened as we grasp the wonders of the gospel, so prayer follows as our hearts respond to these glorious truths. Enjoy your prayer life is a delightful read; and as you turn the pages, it'll show you that prayer doesn't have to be a duty to be performed, but is rather a gift to be enjoyed.</p></p><p>Dr. Michael Reeves is Theologian at Large at Wales Evangelical School of Theology (WEST).Let Michael Reeves nourish and encourage your prayer life!

So too shall journalist and blogger Josh Scherer change the course of late-night, often-insane, sometimes-smart-but-always-monstrous munchie food that puts your MSG packet garbage to shame. You'll find more than seventy creations broken into the ten "brossential" food groups like: Beer, Fried Things, Tacos, and Struggle Snacks (because money is hard). Josh's recipes range from indulgent eats like Beer-Poached Bratwurst Party Subs and Mac 'n' Cheese Nachos to hella-classy dishes like Broccolini with Burnt Lemon Hollandaise and Pork Belly Tacos with Fish Sauce Caramel. Sprinkled in are the unholy commandments for bro cooking, such as "bagged wine is the only wine you need," and Josh's expert advice on how to beat a hangover (it's mostly just pastrami and emotionally purging movies). <i>The Culinary Bro-Down Cookbook</i> is full of irreverent essays and anecdotes, but running throughout is a deep sense of soul and self that strives to answer the question: Why can't the deep-fried nonsense you eat with your bros at 2 a.m. have the same emotional gravitas as an intimate family dinner?

You cannot get to the holy without going through the human, Rob tells us. When considering a passage, we shouldn&#x2019;t ask "Why did God say . . .?" To get to the heart of the Bible&#x2019;s meaning, we should be asking: "What&#x2019;s the story that&#x2019;s unfolding here and why did people find it important to tell it? What was it that moved them to record these words? What was happening in the world at that time? What does this passage/story/poem/verse/book tell us about how people understood who they were and who God was at that time?" In asking these questions, Rob goes beyond the one-dimensional question of "is it true?" to reveal the Bible&#x2019;s authentic transformative power.</p><p>Rob addresses the concerns of all those who see the Bible as God&#x2019;s Word but are troubled by the ethical dilemmas, errors, and inconsistencies in Scripture.

When she was not found, the family, the wardens, and the Navy personnel who searched for her were devastated. The Maine Warden Service continued to follow leads for more than a year. They never completely gave up the search. Two years after her disappearance, her bones and scattered possessions were found by chance by two surveyors. She was on the U.S. Navy&#x2019;s SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape) School land, about 2,100 feet from the Appalachian Trail.<br><br></p><p>This book tells the story of events preceding Geraldine Largay&#x2019;s vanishing in July 2013, while hiking the Appalachian Trail in Maine, what caused her to go astray, and the massive search and rescue operation that followed. Her disappearance sparked the largest lost-person search in Maine history, which culminated in her being presumed dead. She was never again seen alive. The author was one of the hundreds of volunteers who searched for her. Gerry&#x2019;s story is one of heartbreak, most assuredly, but is also one of perseverance, determination, and faith. For her family and the searchers, especially the Maine Warden Service, it is also a story of grave sorrow.<br><br></p><p>Marrying the joys and hardship of life in the outdoors, as well as exploring the search &amp; rescue community, When You Find My Body examines dying with grace and dignity.

Wright offers a radical look at the apostle Paul, illuminating the humanity and remarkable achievements of this intellectual who invented Christian theology&#x2014;transforming a faith and changing the world.</p><p>For centuries, Paul, the apostle who "saw the light on the Road to Damascus" and made a miraculous conversion from zealous Pharisee persecutor to devoted follower of Christ, has been one of the church&#x2019;s most widely cited saints. While his influence on Christianity has been profound, N. T. Wright argues that Bible scholars and pastors have focused so much attention on Paul&#x2019;s letters and theology that they have too often overlooked the essence of the man&#x2019;s life and the extreme unlikelihood of what he achieved.</p><p>To Wright, "The problem is that Paul is central to any understanding of earliest Christianity, yet Paul was a Jew; for many generations Christians of all kinds have struggled to put this together." Wright contends that our knowledge of Paul and appreciation for his legacy cannot be complete without an understanding of his Jewish heritage. Giving us a thoughtful, in-depth exploration of the human and intellectual drama that shaped Paul, Wright provides greater clarity of the apostle&#x2019;s writings, thoughts, and ideas and helps us see them in a fresh, innovative way.</p><p><em>Paul</em> is a compelling modern biography that reveals the apostle&#x2019;s greater role in Christian history&#x2014;as an inventor of new paradigms for how we understand Jesus and what he accomplished&#x2014;and celebrates his stature as one of the most effective and influential intellectuals in human history.</p></p><p><p>For centuries, Paul, the apostle who &#x201c;saw the light on the Road to Damascus&#x201d; and changed dramatically from zealous Pharisee persecutor to devoted follower of Jesus, has been one of the church&#x2019;s most widely cited early teachers. Yet for leading New Testament scholar and Anglican bishop N. T. Wright, most Bible scholars and pastors have not fully grasped what Paul was actually doing and why.</p><p>In focusing on Paul&#x2019;s letters and theology, Wright argues, they have, in short, overlooked the essence of the man&#x2019;s life and the extreme unlikelihood of what he achieved. In response, Wright offers a new way of understanding one of the most famous Christian figures. Wright draws attention to Paul the man&#x2014;the man who survived assassination attempts, imprisonments, and shipwrecks all while inventing new language and concepts for faithfully translating Jesus&#x2019;s story for the Gentile world.&nbsp;</p><p>In this pioneering new account, Wright celebrates Paul&#x2019;s humanity, arguing that this is the best context for understanding him and ultimately for appreciating how he invented new paradigms for how we understand Jesus. &#x201c;The problem,&#x201d; Wright explains, &#x201c;is that while Paul is central to any understanding of early Christianity, we cannot understand him without taking full account of the pre-Christian Jewish beliefs and hopes that he believed had been fulfilled in Jesus.&#x201d; Only when we consider Paul in this manner can we move on to understanding how he led the way for Christianity to conquer the Roman world.&nbsp;</p><p>N.

You cannot change the <br>circumstances, the seasons, or the <br>wind, but you can change yourself. <br>&#x2015; Jim Rohn<br>Self-made millionaire, success coach, and philosopher</p> <p><br>It's going around like a bad flu. It's infecting innocent people and restricting their potential. What is it? The shocking myth that we are simply entitled to a great life. <br>How could this happen? Well, many of us today believe that somehow, somewhere, someone (certainly not us) is responsible for filling our lives with continual happiness, exciting career options, entertainment, money, amazing friendships, and relation�ships because . . . well . . . we exist. Isn't that enough? We wish! <br>If you're reading this book, we're sure you are aware that the answer is 'no.' Unfortunately, life doesn't work that way. There is one major defining factor that separates those who hope for a better life and those who have a better life. This determining factor is also the one lesson that this entire book is based on. Here it is: </p> <p>The only person <br>responsible for the <br>quality of your life is ... <br>YOU.</p> <p>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Straight Facts</p> <p>If you want to be successful, retire early, gain the respect of others, and just have more fun, then you need to take 100% responsibility for everything that you do and experience in life. This includes the level of your achievements, the quality of your relationships, your emotions, the results you produce in and out of school, and the state of your health&#x2015;yes, everything! <br><br>But let's get one thing straight: This is not always easy.<br><br>In fact, most of us have been conditioned to blame something outside ourselves for the parts of our life that we don't like. We blame our parents, teachers, friends, MTV, the weather, or even the star-sign forecasts! It's crazy! Most of the time we don't even know we're doing it. The truth is, the real problems or challenges we face usually have little to do with our 'outside world.' We're often scared to look at the source of it all . . . ourselves. <br><br>Sure, we will all experience our own unique challenges that happen out of our control, but taking responsibility means that we don't dwell on the problem, ignore it, complain about it, or blame someone or something else for what we're experiencing. Instead, it means that we take control of our thoughts and our actions, and do whatever we can to improve the situation. <br><br>Sure, life's challenges come in all shapes and sizes, but there is always something that we can do differently to change what we are currently experiencing. And we must first believe this before we will find any new solutions. <br><br>Whether someone is super-successful or struggling to survive, the quality of their life depends on their thoughts, actions, and beliefs. Do you notice a trend here? These three things all have to do with the individual&#x2015;not the teacher, the weather, or outside circumstances. The truth is, success starts with one person . . . </p> <p>That person is you.</p> <p>1. 2 When I First Met Jack</p> <p><br><br>Nathan, 18 (Indianapolis, IN): I didn't meet Jack Canfield under the best circumstances, but looking back, I'm glad we crossed paths.<br>Jack was at my school working with a group of teachers when he heard me arguing with one of my teachers outside the staff room. He left his meeting, walked over to me, and asked me to explain the situation. I told him (in a loud voice) that I had just been suspended from the baseball team and that this wasn't fair. They couldn't do this to me. Not now!<br><br>'What's not fair? And why not now?' asked Jack.<br>I said, 'We're about to go to the state championships next week, and there will be all kinds of scouts for college teams there, and if they see me pitch, I can get a scholarship to college. I can't afford to go to college without a baseball scholarship. This is my only chance. It's not fair!' <br>I expected some sympathy, but instead, Jack said, 'Let me ask you a question.'<br><br>'Okay.'<br><br>'When did you first learn that school was not fair? Really . . . tell me the truth.'<br><br>'When I was in grade school,' I told him.<br><br>'Okay, so why are you standing there pretending to act like you don't know that school is not fair? Every teacher has a different set of rules. Some teachers enforce some rules and not others. Sometimes good kids get bad breaks, and kids who don't play by the rules get away with breaking them. Isn't that true?' asked Jack.<br><br>'Yes.'<br><br>'So it's not about whether school is fair or not. The real question is 'What did you do to get yourself suspended?' I doubt they just randomly picked your name out of a hat. So how did you create this situation&#x2015;getting yourself suspended?'<br><br>'I was late to school.'<br><br>'Just once?'<br><br>'No, several times.'<br><br>'How many times?'<br><br>'I'm not sure. Maybe six or seven times.'<br><br>Jack then turned to my principal who was now watching our conversation and asked, 'What's the rule here? How many times do you have to be late without a legitimate reason before you get suspended from an athletic team?'<br><br>'Three times,' my principal said. <br><br>Jack turned back to me and asked, 'Were you aware of this rule?'<br><br>'Yes.' <br><br>'Then why did you break it so many times?'<br><br>'Well, after the third time nothing happened, so I didn't think they were serious.'<br><br>Jack turned back to the principal and said, 'So this is where the school participated in creating this situation. By not consistently enforcing the rules, you helped him believe there were no rules. This is why he claims it's unfair.' <br><br>Jack turned back to me and said, 'But that doesn't let you off the hook. You did know the rule, and you chose to ignore it. So, what did you make more important than playing baseball and getting a scholarship to college?'<br><br>I looked Jack straight in the eyes and said, 'Nothing's more important than playing baseball. It's the most important thing in my life.'<br><br>Jack responded by saying, 'Not true.'<br><br>As you can imagine, this made me angry. He continued, 'You made something else more important than getting to school on time so you could play baseball. <br><br>What was it?'<br><br>I could feel the pressure, and there was no way to back out. I thought about his question for a moment and then said, 'You mean sleeping in?'<br><br>'I don't know. You tell me,' Jack responded.<br><br>'I guess that would be it.'<br><br>'Is sleeping in really more important to you than playing baseball?'<br><br>'No. No way!'<br><br>'Then why didn't you get up?'<br><br>'Well, when the alarm goes off, I hit the snooze button&#x2015;sometimes more than once&#x2015;and then I end up being late.'<br><br>We talked for a little longer, and then Jack convinced my principal to give me one more shot now that I was more aware the situation and was accepting full responsibility. But, we all agreed, if I was late one more time, I would be suspended with no rights to complain or fight about it.<br><br>There was one last problem to solve. I needed a new strategy to make sure I would get up on time. Hitting the snooze couldn't be an option. We brainstormed and came up with several strategies. First, I had to put my clock on the other side of the room so I would have to get out of bed to turn it off. And, second, if I wasn't up by a certain time, I had to pay my mom a dollar to pour ice water on me. I knew my mom would be very happy to do that!<br><br>I was not late anymore. Jack helped me realize what it really meant to take 100% responsibility. The rest of my baseball season went well&#x2015;even my coach commented on my change of attitude. Now, I'm attending college on a baseball scholarship. It's a good feeling to know that I was able to take control and make it happen.</p> <p><br>1. 3 Inside Out</p> <p><br>Night has fallen, and the city has become dark. A man is on his hands and knees searching for something under a streetlamp when a young woman passing by asks the man what he is doing. He explains that he lost a key and is desperately looking for it. The young woman offers to help him search for the key. <br>An hour later, the woman says in a confused tone, 'We've looked everywhere for it, and we haven't found it. Are you sure you lost the key here?' The man replies, 'No, I lost it in my house, but there is more light out here under the streetlamp.'<br><br>This is a great example of how we look outside of ourselves for the solution to our problems because it's easier than searching for the real cause, which is inside us. We are the source of our problems, and we need to face that fact because until we do, we can't change anything. We need to look life straight in the eyes and face the facts&#x2015;no matter how uncomfortable it may be. <br><br>Of course, we all want things to get 'better,' but it simply won't happen if we refuse to see things as they are right now. Change can only begin once we acknow�ledge that there is something we need to change. You might be happy with the way things are in your life&#x2015;and that's fantastic&#x2015;but every successful person knows there is always room for improvement. <br><br>The very first step to achieving major success and enjoying the things that are most important to you is to take 100% responsibility for your life. Anything short of that won't get you what you really want. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1. 4 Excuses or Excellence? <br>You Choose</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ninety-nine percent of all failures <br>come from people who have a habit of making excuses.<br>&#x2015;George Washington Carver<br>American agricultural researcher and educator</p> <p>Like opposite forces of a magnet, success and excuses just refuse to work together. They simply cannot co-exist. <br>It's either one or the other.<br>Taking responsibility means more than just taking initiative and owning up to mistakes. It also requires that we stop making excuses. <br>As long as there are excuses, there will be no positive results. Think about it: Every excuse is like pushing the ejection button on an airplane. The minute you push it, you've committed to exit the plane. In that instant you're heading in a completely new direction, leaving the opportunity for success behind. Excuses allow us to give up mentally and justify why something can't be done or why we're not good enough&#x2015;and once that happens . . . game over. <br><br>Kent: Truly successful people know that even the best excuses don't help anything. It doesn't even matter if the excuses are truthful and accurate. A few years ago, my brother and I learned this lesson the hard way while we were writing our first book. <br><br>When we started the project, we were in school, playing sports, working, and trying to write the book as well. There were many times we barely had enough energy or time to finish our homework, let alone work on our book. <br><br>'How's the book coming along?' people would ask us. We'd tell them the truth, 'Well, we just haven't had the time lately. By the time we finally get home from �morning practice, school, and afternoon practice, we are exhausted. Then we have homework. So we haven't been able to work on the book.' <br>It was almost as though people expected to hear this response. They listened to our explanation (which was really an excuse) and responded with a simple, 'Huh, okay.' That was it. Nothing more. <br><br>The truth was, we really were tired, and we were short on time, but believing that we couldn't do anything to change the circumstances meant we weren't really taking full responsibility. Taking 100% responsibility means that we are committed to finding a solution to the challenges we face. <br><br>Here's what we learned: No matter how truthful your excuses are, people don't want to hear them. All excuses do is slow us down, and nobody benefits from them. The only way my brother and I were able to finish our book was when we stopped making excuses, stopped complaining, and just got to work.<br><br>So, what's step number one? Believing that we have the power to make things better and produce the results we really want. We all make excuses for different reasons, but it really doesn't matter what those reasons are. All that matters is that from this point forward we choose&#x2015;that's right, it's a choice&#x2015;to act as if we are 100% responsible for everything that does or doesn't happen to us. In short, YOU must decide to be in control.<br><br>A lot of people roll their eyes when they hear the word 'responsibility.' They say, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah . . . I've heard all of that before!' (And, yes, we were two of 'those people.') But there is a big difference between 'knowing' about something and 'acting' on something. <br><br>Jack: When I wrote the original The Success Principles book, taking responsibility was also the very first principle&#x2015;and that book was designed for adults! Sometimes we just need to be reminded of what we already know so we can put the ideas into practice. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1. 5 The Blame and <br>Complain Game</p> <p>All blame is a waste of time.<br>No matter how much fault you find with another,<br>and regardless of how much you blame him,<br>it will not change you.<br>&#x2015;Wayne Dyer<br>Bestselling author and inspirational speaker</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Question: What are the two easiest things to do when we don't get the results we want?</p> <p>Answers: <br>1) Place the blame on someone or something else<br>2) Complain about it<br>How do we know this? Because we've been guilty of both these things. Believe us, we know how easy this is. Anyone bold enough to admit it would also say that they, too, have fallen into this trap. But just because it's easy doesn't mean it's right.</p> <p>Let's take a look at the first trap: blaming.</p> <p>Taking responsibility means that you don't blame other people or things outside of yourself. If you think about it, blaming is really just another form of excuse-making. It's a way for us to come up with a reason why we didn't perform. And, you guessed it, all it does is slow us down.<br><br>Blair, age 22 (Salt Lake City, UT): I wanted good grades; I wanted to be MVP on my volleyball team; and I wanted to be fit and healthy . . . but I guess that wasn't enough. <br><br>My intentions were good, but achieving all of this was a much bigger commitment than I thought. When I didn't get the grade I hoped for or I didn't make a good serve on the volleyball court, I immediately looked for things that other people weren't doing right. I refused to admit that I was probably the cause.<br>I blamed my teachers for not teaching well enough. I blamed my teammates for not trying hard enough. And I blamed my piles of homework for the reason I �couldn't exercise enough. This made me feel good in the moment because, after all, 'It wasn't my fault.' Nothing was my fault . . . and that's where I ran into trouble.<br><br>Blaming became a habit that I wasn't even aware of. I didn't see it at the time, but my blaming made me a 'good' complainer as well. Finally, someone challenged me. He said, 'What are you going to do to change things?' I quickly responded by saying, 'I can't do anything. It's out of my control.' My friend then said, 'So, are you saying that other people control your life, your results, and your happiness?' <br><br>Wow! I was taken by surprise. I never looked at the situation like that before. I noticed that the reason I never achieved my goals was because I was letting the world walk all over me. I realized that I do have the power to change things. I'm now twenty-two, and I have accomplished more of my goals in the last year than in the previous twenty-one years of my life. For me, the power of responsibility was life-changing.<br>TIP: Instead of pointing the finger at other people, use it to identify a new s...</p></p><h2>Siblings: You're Stuck with Each Other, So Stick Together (Laugh &amp; Learn�)</h2><p>Brothers and sisters: they can make great friends, and it&#x2019;s nice to have someone who&#x2019;ll love you no matter what.

Through stories, tests, and experiences in the wild, the sage challenges Millman to examine 12 core principles that underlie human existence: balance, choice, process, presence, compassion, faith, expectation, integrity, action, cycles, surrender, and unity. The book shows how these keys at the heart of every religion, culture, and moral system can lead to a deeper sense of meaning, connection, and harmony with the world. It also shows readers how these principles can transform relationships, careers, finance, and health. Quotations and reminders from across the centuries inform and inspire readers as they accompany Millman on his journey.</p><p>While hiking in the mountains, Millman encounters a mysterious woman sage who invites him on &#34;a mission of great importance&#34;. Over the course of several days and nights, she uses the mountain wilderness as a means to reveal the &#34;laws that make life work&#34;. The Law of Spirit represents Millman&#39;s most accessible and far-reaching vision of spiritual growth to date.To our readers: The books we publish are our contribution to an emerging world based on cooperation rather than on competition, on affirmation of the human spirit rather than on self-doubt, and on the certainty that all humanity is connected.

The twig bent, but held. Horseman rocked back on his heels and surveyed the deadfall. He should have put a little more blood on the twig, he thought, but it might be enough. He had placed this one just right, with the twig at the edge of the kangaroo rat's trail. The least nibble and the stone would fall. He reached into his shirt front, pulled out a leather pouch, extracted an odd-shaped lump of turquoise, and placed it on the ground in front of him. Then he started to sing: </p><p><i>"The Sky it talks about it.<br> The Talking God One he tells about it.<br> The Darkness to Be One knows about it.<br> The Talking God is with me.<br> With the Talking God I kill the male game."</i></p><p>There was another part of the song, but Horseman couldn't remember it. He sat very still, thinking. Something about the Black God, but he couldn't think how it went. The Black God didn't have anything to do with game, but his uncle had said you have to put it in about him to make the chant come out right. He stared at the turquoise bear. It said nothing. He glanced at his watch. It, was almost six. By the time he got back to the rimrock it would be late enough to make a little fire, dark enough to hide the smoke. Now he must finish this. </p><p><i>"The dark horn of the bica,<br>No matter who would do evil to me,<br>The evil shall not harm me.<br>The dark horn is a shield of beaten buckskin."</i></p><p>Horseman chanted in a barely audible voice, just loud enough to be heard in the minds of the animals. </p><p><i>"That evil which the Ye-i turned toward me<br>cannot reach me through the dark horn,<br>through the shield the bica carries.<br>It brings me harmony with the male game.<br>It makes the male game hear my heartbeat.<br> From four directions they trot toward me.<br> They step and turn their sides toward me.<br><br> So my arrow misses bone when I shoot.<br>The death of male game comes toward me.<br>The blood of male game will wash my body.<br> The male game will obey my thoughts."</i></p><p>He replaced the turquoise bear in the medicine pouch and rose stiffly to his feet. He was pretty sure that wasn't the right song. It was for deer, he thought. To make the deer come out where you could shoot them. But maybe the kangaroo rats would hear it, too. He looked carefully across the plateau, searching the foreground first, then the mid-distance, finally the great green slopes of the Lukachukai Mountains, which rose to the east. Then he moved away from the shelter of the stunted juniper and walked rapidly northwestward, moving silently and keeping to the bottom of the shallow arroyos when he could. He walked gracefully and silently. Suddenly he stopped. The corner of his eye had caught motion on the floor of the Kam Bimghi Valley. Far below him and a dozen miles to the west, a puff of dust was suddenly visible against a formation of weathered red rocks. It might be a dust devil, kicked up by one of the Hard Flint Boys playing their tricks on the Wind Children. But it was windless now. The stillness of late afternoon had settled over the eroded waste below him. </p><p>Must have been a truck, Horseman thought, and the feeling of dread returned. He moved cautiously out of the wash behind a screen of pi�ons and stood motionless, examining the landscape below him. Far to the west, Bearer of the Sun had moved down the sky and was outlining in brilliant white the form of a thunderhead over Hoskininie Mesa. The plateau where Horseman stood was in its shadow but the slanting sunlight still lit the expanse of the Kam Bimghi. There was no dust by the red rocks now, and Horseman wondered if his eyes had tricked him. Then he saw it again. A puff of dust moving slowly across the valley floor. A truck, Horseman thought, or a car. It would be on that track that came across the slick rocks and branched out toward Horse Fell and Many Ruins Canyon, and now to Tall Poles Butte where the radar station was. It must be a truck, or a jeep. That track wasn't much even in good weather. Horseman watched intently. In a minute he could tell. </p><p>And if it turned toward Many Ruins Canyon, he would move cast across the plateau and up into the Lukachukais. And that would mean being hungry. </p><p>The dust disappeared as the vehicle dropped into one of the mazes of arroyos which cut the valley into a crazy quilt of erosion. Then he saw it again and promptly lost it where the track wound to the west of Natani Tso, the great flat-topped lava butte which dominated the north end of the valley. Almost five minutes passed before he saw the dust again. </p><p>"Ho," Horseman said, and relaxed. The truck had turned toward Tall Poles. It would be the Army people who watched the radar place. He moved away from the tree, trotting now. He was hungry and there was a porcupine to singe, clean, and roast before he would eat. </p><p>Luis Horseman had chosen this camp with care. Here the plateau was cut by one of the hundred nameless canyons which drained into the depth of Many Ruins Canyon. Along the rim, the plateau's granite cap, its sandstone support eroded away, had fractured under its own weight. Some of these great blocks of stone had crashed into the canyon bottom, leaving behind room-sized gaps in the rimrock. Others had merely tilted and slid. Behind one of these, Horseman knelt over his fire. It was a small fire, built in the extreme corner of the natural enclosure.</p></p><h2>Practical Botany for Gardeners: Over 3,000 Botanical Terms Explained and Explored</h2><p>Gardening can be frustratingly shrouded in secrecy. Fickle plants make seemingly spontaneous decisions to bloom or bust, seeds sprout magically in the blink of an eye, and deep-rooted mysteries unfold underground and out of sight. Understanding basic botany is like unlocking a horticultural code; fortunately learning a little science can reveal the secrets of the botanical universe and shed some light on what&#x2019;s really going on in your garden.<br><br><i>Practical Botany for Gardeners</i> provides an elegant and accessible introduction to the world of botany. It presents the essentials that every gardener needs to know, connecting explanations of scientific facts with useful gardening tips. Flip to the roots section and you&#x2019;ll not only learn how different types of roots support a plant but also find that adding fungi to soil aids growth. The pruning section both defines &#x201c;lateral buds&#x201d; and explains how far back on a shoot to cut in order to propagate them.<br><br>The book breaks down key areas and terminology with easy-to-navigate chapters arranged by theme, such as plant types, plant parts, inner workings, and external factors. &#x201c;Great Botanists&#x201d; and &#x201c;Botany in Action&#x201d; boxes delve deeper into the fascinating byways of plant science. This multifaceted book also includes two hundred botanical illustrations and basic diagrams that hearken to the classic roots of botany.<br><br>Part handbook, part reference, <i>Practical Botany for Gardeners</i> is a beautifully captivating read. It&#x2019;s a must for garden lovers and backyard botanists who want to grow and nurture their own plant knowledge.<br></p><p><b>Geoff Hodge </b>is a gardening and horticultural writer living in Peterborough, UK, and the former gardening editor for <i>Gardening News</i>.

You&#x2019;ll be better equipped to take on the challenge after reading the chapter on pruning in <i>Practical Botany for Gardeners</i>. . . . Botanical illustrations on almost every page add a decorative touch, and profiles of botanical artists pay tribute to those who make plants come alive on the page."

Perhaps best-known for the modern hymn, &#x201c;In Christ Alone&#x201d; (written by Keith with Stuart Townend), the Gettys have helped reinvent the traditional hymn form, creating a catalog of songs teaching Christian doctrine and crossing musical genres, and invigorate the interest of a whole new generation of people in hymns. Their <i>Sing!</i> campaign is part of a movement to encourage church congregations in their singing. Keith and Kristyn live between Northern Ireland and Nashville with their daughters, Eliza, Charlotte, and Grace.</p>&#x201c;The beauty of this book is how consistent it is with who and what the Gettys have been to the Church over the past decade. Their contribution is not significant because of the extraordinary but the ordinary. They are ordinary Christians who have made an extraordinary impact, not because of their musical or theological credentials, but because of their desire and willingness to devote themselves to the ordinary things. <i>S</i><i>i</i><i>n</i><i>g! </i>is an exposition of those ordinary things that have allowed the Gettys to be used by the Lord to bless, encourage, and provoke so many of us not only to &#x2018;sing to the Lord a new song,&#x2019; but also to love and appreciate the old ones.

From the Native Americans, the migrating white men and women, the cowboys, and the foreigners, it is a story of trappers, traders, homesteaders, gold seekers, ranchers, and hunters--all caught up in the dramatic events and violent conflicts that shaped the destiny of our legendary West.<b>James A. Michener</b> was one of the world&#x2019;s most popular writers, the author of more than forty books of fiction and nonfiction, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Tales of the South Pacific, </i>the bestselling novels <i>The Source, Hawaii, Alaska, Chesapeake, Centennial, Texas, Caribbean, </i>and <i>Caravans, </i>and the memoir <i>The World Is My Home</i>. Michener served on the advisory council to NASA and the International Broadcast Board, which oversees the Voice of America.

Remember his face!" </i><br> <br>Ben Richards is a desperate man. With no job, no money, no way out, and a young daughter in need of proper medical attention, he must turn to the only possibility of striking it rich in this near-future dystopian America: participating in the ultra-violent TV programming of the government-sanctioned Games Network. Ben soon finds himself selected as a contestant on the biggest and the best that the Games Network has to offer: &#x201c;The Running Man,&#x201d; a no-holds-barred thirty-day struggle to stay alive as public enemy number one, relentlessly hunted by an elite strike force bent on killing him as quickly as possible in front of an audience all-too eager to see that happen. It means a billion dollars in prize money if he can live for the next month. No one has ever survived longer than eight days. But desperation can push a person do things they never thought possible&#x2014;and Ben Richards is willing to go the distance in this ultimate game of life and death....</p><p>Stephen King (writing as Richard Bachman) crafted <i>The Running Man</i> early in his career, though after such mega-hits as <i>Carrie</i> and <i>The Shining</i>. A bit of a departure from the supernatural horror that is most frequently associated with his work, the novel describes a science fiction dystopia where market capitalism and television game shows have spiraled out of control, and the separation between the haves and the have-nots has been formalized with separate currencies. King establishes characters quickly, creating sympathy in the first few pages for Ben Richards--whose 18-month-old baby girl is suffering from a horrible cough, perhaps pneumonia. Not able to afford medicine, Richards enters himself in the last-chance money-making scheme of the Free-Vee games. The games include <i>Treadmill to Bucks</i>, in which heart-attack prone contestants struggle to outlast a progressively demanding treadmill, or the accurately named <i>Swim the Crocodiles</i>. After a rigorous battery of physical and mental examinations, Richards is assigned "Elevator Six"--the path of a chosen few--that leads to <i>The Running Man</i> game. In this game, the stakes and the prizes are raised. Success means a life of luxury. Failure means death. Unfortunately, few ever win the game; in fact, as the producer tells Richards, in six years no one has survived.<p> <i>The Running Man</i> is a short book, tightly written to be read and enjoyed quickly. The future world it depicts is vividly captured with a few essential details. The action is also fast paced and, though the novel differs from much of King's other work, the sardonic social commentary reveals a pleasing glimmer of King's characteristically twisted sense of humor. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

Dav was so disruptive in class that his teachers made him sit out in the hall every day. Luckily, Dav loved to draw and make up stories, so he spent his time in the hallway creating his own original comic books. In the second grade, Dav Pilkey created a comic book about a superhero named Captain Underpants. His teacher ripped it up and told him he couldn&#x2019;t spend the rest of his life making silly books. Fortunately, Dav was not a very good listener. Dav has gone on to create award-winning and bestselling books for children.

Why is the 0% tax bracket so important? Because if tax rates double, as some experts predict, two times zero is still zero! He also showed how, in many cases, it&#x2019;s impossible to get to the 0% tax bracket without using a Life Insurance Retirement Plan (LIRP).In this follow-up book, Look Before Your LIRP, he makes the case that, while a variety of LIRPs may help get you to the 0% tax bracket, not all will do so with the same efficiency or effectiveness. In fact, finding the right LIRP for your tax-free retirement plan can be just like finding the ideal spouse. Just as you likely had a list of qualities you were looking for in a life-long partner, you should have certain attributes and provisions in mind when looking for the ideal LIRP. Look Before Your LIRP spells out exactly what you&#x2019;ll need to build a successful LIRP relationship and reveals the one LIRP best suited to get you to the 0% tax bracket.</p><p>David McKnight graduated from Brigham Young University with Honors in 1997. Over the past 20 years David has helped put thousands of Americans on the road to the zero percent tax bracket.

In Part I, Jennings describes the effects of trauma on body and mind, and how to recognize them in students' behavior. In Part II, she introduces the trauma-sensitive practices she has implemented in her work with schools. And in Part III, she connects the dots between mindfulness, compassion, and resilience. Each chapter contains easy-to-use, practical activities to hone the skills needed to create a compassionate learning environment.</p></p><p><strong>Patricia A.

Cast</b></p><p></p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Why vampyres? What was intriguing to you about them? (Also, why "y"?)</p><p> <strong>P.C. Cast:</strong> Actually, the idea for the series originated with my fabulous agent, Meredith Bernstein. We were at RWA [Romance Writers of America] Nationals in Reno several years ago and Meredith said she had an idea for a series she'd like to see me write. Then she said the three magic words: vampire finishing school. I instantly thought of YA because I'd been reading the <em>Hawksong</em> books by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes--so my head was already in YA. Also, I've been teaching high school English since 1993 (I'm from a family of teachers) so I definitely knew my audience. Basically, it sounded like fun to write, so I jumped in even though I'd only written fantasy and paranormal romance up until then.</p><p> Oh, and the spelling is just my choice 'cause I like the way it looks!</p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> I don't want to draw too many comparisons between your series and <em>Twilight</em>, because they are completely different types of stories. However, I am curious if the popularity of that series has changed the way you see your genre, or do you even see it being the same genre?</p><p> <strong>PC:</strong> I see my genre as YA, and to me that encompasses everyone from Rowling to Laurie Halse Anderson to Janice Erlbaum. So, yes, <em>Twilight</em> fits in the same genre. And while I enjoy Ms. Meyer's books very much, I think the genre has been growing and changing and gaining popularity steadily over the past decade--mostly thanks to Ms. Rowling! As a high school English teacher I certainly noticed the increase in sophistication and popularity of the genre some time ago. Today's YA has an incredible range and depth, and it deals with real coming of age issues in varied and interesting ways. I'm proud to be a member of the ranks of YA authors!</p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Can you talk a little bit about the role that religion plays in the novels? The whole series revolves around the worship of Nyx, the Goddess of Night, and <em>Hunted</em> really digs into questions of faith and free will (often related to what guy Zoey will be drawn to next...very clever to make that her weakness!). At various points in the series you also have People of Faith, Catholic nuns, and Cherokee legend. How do you see all these elements working together?</p><p> <strong>PC:</strong> Very clever of you to recognize the ramifications of Zoey's weakness!</p><p> It's easy for me to weave the different religious elements of the world together because it's not really "religion" I'm dealing with when I create the conflicts and faith foundations in the House of Night. Instead I see it as a way to illuminate coming of age issues, which often deal with conformity and obsession and trying to learn boundaries. I chose to give my heroine a belief system in which to live that is matriarchal because my purpose is to empower young women, and by allowing Zoey to join a world where women are valued as leaders and really have no glass ceiling, except the ones they create for themselves, as exemplified by Neferet, I have a springboard for a lot of girl power.</p><p> <strong>Amazon.com: </strong>What were some of your influences for the House of Night school?</p><p> <strong>PC:</strong> South Intermediate High School in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma! I just looked around me and wrote what I saw. I also write what I wish I could see, as in the amazing HoN facility and their very cool classes. I'd love to teach a Vampyre Sociology class!</p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> How has Kristin being in school affected the series as it's progressed? The scenes with friends hanging out and geeking out on movies in the dorm seem pretty familiar...</p><p> <strong>PC:</strong> When the series started Kristin was nineteen and was still living at home her first semester in college. And then when she did move out it certainly wasn't into a dorm that looked as cool as the House of Night dorms! But she does DEFINITELY geek out with her friends. (She's going to kill me for that...)</p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> When did the two of you decide to write a book together? How does your writing process work?</p><p> <strong>PC:</strong> I brought Kristin in while I was writing the first three chapters of <em>Marked</em>. I kept stumbling over silly little things, like specific slang that I thought I knew, but found out once I started writing about teenagers that MY deeply buried inner teen from the 70's kept trying to resurface and butt in with her slang! Kristin keeps me straight about that. She also says she keeps Zoey from "sounding like a 40-something disgruntled school teacher." Sigh.</p><p> We're on book six of the series, and we have the process down. We do some brainstorming, then I write the first draft, often asking Kristin questions right in the manuscript or leaving blanks for her to fill in. Then I send the entire thing to her, and she goes through it, answering questions, filling in blanks, and asking me questions/making comments of her own. She sends it back to me and I go through it again. Then it's ready to go to St. Martin's and our lovely editor, Jennifer Weis. It sounds like a tedious process, but it's really very freeing for me. I can write whatever and know Kristin has my back.</p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Zoey has a few mother-daughter-like relationships--with her mom, her grandma, Neferet, Nyx. How much does your mother-daughter relationship inform your writing? Is it ever awkward?</p><p> <strong>PC:</strong> Hmm...that's a good question. Kristin and I have a unique writing relationship. Actually, I probably wouldn't even consider writing with anyone else--it's unusually easy with my daughter (perhaps because I can beat her?). She and I have always been close, and we have a very honest relationship. Talking with each other has never been a problem, so we're used to communicating. That helps a lot in a co-author situation.</p><p> Regarding the mother-daughter relationships in the book: clearly Zoey's relationship with her own mom is nothing like Kristin and mine. Sadly, both of us have met many Linda Heffers here in Oklahoma, which is why she is so easy--and disturbing--for us to write. When I write Nyx's words I often think about how I feel about Kristin, and then try to expand that to how this goddess would view the vampyres, especially Zoey, as her children.</p><p> We get the awkward question often because of the sexual tension in the books. Kristin and I do discuss the temperature of the books and the specific situations a lot. It doesn't feel awkward between us because we're used to communicating, and because we don't just stick sex in our series to be gratuitous. The sexual issues are there because they're realistic to teenagers. Yes, Zoey has several boyfriends--often at the same time. But in six books she has had sex once, and that was because she was manipulated and used by a charismatic adult. It wasn't awkward writing those parts with my daughter--we believe in the reality of the books and the points we make about mistakes and consequences.</p><p> <strong>Amazon.com: </strong>Each of the books sort of has its own personality. <em>Chosen</em>, for example, was more focused on the friends and the guys, and <em>Untamed</em> was much more deeply focused on folklore and goddess rituals. Do you think that's influenced by each of your interests, with Kristin having more influence on one book and P.C. showing up more in another? Or is that just the natural arc of the story?</p><p> <strong>PC:</strong> I think the shifting emphasis is because of the natural arc of the story. Think about your own life. Doesn't your focus shift from time to time? I know mine does. Actually, sometimes it feels like events happen in waves: lots of guy, no guys, friend stres, no friend stress, crazy stuff at school, kinda calm school, etc. So I guess fiction is just mimicking the patterns I see in life.</p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Even though it has a satisfying ending (no spoilers!) <em>Hunted</em> certainly doesn't seem like the end of Zoey's story.

Seriously, now that the dark influences that have been lurking on the periphery of Zoey's world have been brought out into the open, it's time to deal with them. Of course that's a lot harder than "Okay, Z, kick their butts and save the world now!" sounds.

The shifts in your metabolism that block hunger and prevent weight loss plateaus after surgery can be obtained by focusing your diet on nutrient rich foods like fruits and vegetables. The style of eating outlined shows you how to use food to control hunger, eliminate cravings and prevent a slow down in your metabolism that plagues typical starvation diets.A Pound of Cure is a step by step guide that shows you how to change your style of eating sensibly, over time. Each of the 12 changes, or &#x201c;stations&#x201d; outlined in the program brings you closer to gaining control over the hunger and food cravings that have sabotaged your previous efforts. It is designed to be a lifelong change and nothing less and does not buy into the madness of starvation or fad diets. If you are tired of the fad diets and the commercial diet industry that peddles artificial, synthetic diet foods as healthy choices, the Pound of Cure plan will show you how to eat sensibly, control your hunger and lose the weight for the rest of your life.</p><p>Matthew Weiner, MD is a weight loss surgeon who lives and practices in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan.

In Q, the true meaning of the "kingdom of God" is the fulfillment of a just society through the transformation of the human relationships within it.</p><p>Though this document has never been found, John Kloppenborg offers a succinct account of why scholars maintain it existed in the first place and demonstrates how they have been able to reconstruct its contents and wording from the two later Gospels that used it as a source: Matthew and Luke.

That is the important thesis demonstrated in Christianity Before Christ. The least important features, as well as the most important components, were all well developed in cultures that flourished before the time that Christ is alleged to have walked the parched paths of Roman Palestine. The information presented in this book is absolutely crucial if Atheists and other free thinkers are to understand the nature of the beast that threatens not only their liberties and rights as citizens in a secular republic, but also threatens to return world civilization itself back to the prescientific levels of the ancient cultures from which Christianity derived all its odd details. Every Atheist needs to know what is in this book!JOHN G. JACKSON was an educator, lecturer, author, and man of principle. He was born on April 1, 1907, into a family of Methodists. In old age, he averred he had been an Atheist since he became old enough to think. The family minister once asked him when he was small, "Who made you?" After some thought he replied from his own realization, "I don't know." He lived for nearly fifty years in New York City, lecturing at the "Ingersoll Forum" of the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism (1930-1955). During a parallel period he wrote articles for the Truth Seeker magazine. From 1932 to 1972 he was a writer and associate of the Rationalist Press Association in London, England. <p>A pioneer in the field of African and Afro-American studies, he taught such courses from 1971 to 1980 at Rutgers University, New York University, and in Illinois.

"This vibrant and moving award-winning novel has heart to spare."*</strong></p><p>Eleven-year-old Delphine is like a mother to her two younger sisters, Vonetta and Fern. She's had to be, ever since their mother, Cecile, left them seven years ago for a radical new life in California. But when the sisters&nbsp;arrive from Brooklyn to spend the summer with their mother, Cecile is nothing like they imagined.</p><p>While the girls hope to go to Disneyland and meet Tinker Bell, their mother sends them to a day camp run by the Black Panthers. Unexpectedly, Delphine, Vonetta, and Fern learn much about their family, their country, and themselves during one truly crazy summer.</p><p>This moving, funny novel won the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction and the Coretta Scott King Award and was a National Book Award Finalist.

And even though Delphine will have to take care of her sisters, as usual, and learn the truth about the missing pieces of the past. </p><p>When the girls arrive in Oakland in the summer of 1968, Cecile wants nothing to do with them. She makes them eat Chinese takeout dinners, forbids them to enter her kitchen, and never explains the strange visitors with Afros and black berets who knock on her door. Rather than spend time with them, Cecile sends Delphine, Vonetta, and Fern to a summer camp sponsored by a revolutionary group, the Black Panthers, where the girls get a radical new education. </p><p>Set during one of the most tumultuous years in recent American history, one crazy summer is the heartbreaking, funny tale of three girls in search of the mother who abandoned them&#x2014;an unforgettable story told by a distinguished author of books for children and teens, Rita Williams-Garcia. </p><p>Rita Williams-Garcia's Newbery Honor-winning novel, <em>One Crazy Summer</em>, was a winner of the Coretta Scott King Award, a National Book Award finalist, the recipient of the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, and a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller.

But one stormy August day, furious flood water carry him off and dump him on an uninhabited island. Despite his determination and stubborn resourcefulness&#x2015;he tried crossing the river with boats and ropes and even on stepping-stones&#x2015;Abel can't find a way to get back home.</p><p> Days, then weeks and months, pass. Slowly, his soft habits disappear as he forages for food, fashions a warm nest in a hollow log, models clay statues of his family for company, and continues to brood on the problem of how to get across the river&#x2015;and home.</p><p> Abel's time on the island brings him a new understanding of the world he's separated from. Faced with the daily adventure of survival in his solitary, somewhat hostile domain, he is moved to reexamine the easy way of life he had always accepted and discovers skills and talents in himself that hold promise of a more meaningful life, if and when he should finally return to Mossville and his dear Amanda again.</p><br><p><i>Abel's Island</i> is a 1976 New York Times Book Review Notable Children's Book of the Year and Outstanding Book of the Year, and a 1977 Newbery Honor Book.</p></p><p>One summer day, newlywed mice Abel and Amanda are out for a picnic in the woods when they are caught in a sudden storm--a "full-fledged, screaming hurricane" to be precise. As they take refuge in a cave, a wind scoops up Amanda's scarf, and Abel foolishly lunges from safety to retrieve it. So begins William Steig's Newbery Honor Book <i>Abel's Island</i>, the ensuing adventures of this rather foppish mouse as he comes head to head with nature. Amazingly, Abel is swept up in a stream, then a river, then eventually marooned on an island (about 12,000 tails long). He is sure that his rescue is imminent: "It's certainly gotten around that Abelard Hassam di Chirico Flint, of the Mossville Flints, is missing," the society mouse speculates. But he is not so lucky. What will this intelligent, imaginative rodent do to get off the island and back to his beloved Amanda? He busies himself with finding ways to get to shore (including bridges, boats, catapults, stepping stones, and gliders); figuring out what he should eat (everything from mulberries to roasted seeds); and investigating where he should take shelter (in a rotten log). As the weeks and months go by, he misses his books, his paintings, his comfortable stuffed chair, his stylish clothes (now damp, torn, and lumpy), but above all his precious wife Amanda, whom he thinks about constantly. As the mouse faces his new life Robinson Crusoe-style, Abel discovers what it's like to be in tune with the natural world as well as his true nature, and what it's like to return, fortified, to his real home and to the arms of the one he loves. Along the way, readers can't help but rediscover the joys of being alive.

With all four books of the Latin Picatrix complete in one volume, translated &amp; annotated by the noted scholars, magicians and astrologers John Michael Greer &amp; Christopher Warnock, Picatrix takes its rightful place as an essential occult text. Picatrix is an encyclopedic work with over 300 pages of Hermetic magical philosophy, ritual, talismanic and natural magic. Greer &amp; Warnock's complete translation is lucid and well annotated. Renaissance Astrology &amp; Adocentyn Press have released the complete Picatrix in a variety of different editions, including the Liber Atratus, Liber Rubeus and Liber Viridis-Green Magic editions. All editions contain the same basic text, but add additional variant passages, either from the Arabic Picatrix or authors cited, but not found in the Latin Picatrix. The Liber Atratus edition adds a passage on poisons from Ibn Washiyya's Book of Poisons. The Liber Atratus is also available in two Kindle editions with the first volume containing Picatrix Books 1 &amp; 2 and the second volume containing Picatrix Books 3 &amp; 4.</p><p>I was first introduced to Picatrix in 1998 by my magical teacher, Robert Zoller. At that time it was only available in Latin. What Latin I now have, I learned from working with Picatrix. John Greer and I worked together for over two years on this translation, and now finally, a complete and usable English translation of Picatrix is available.<br><br>This translation is indeed complete, including all four books of Picatrix, the most famous grimoire of astrological magic. We used the Pingree's Latin critical edition, so this translation is authoritative, relying on multiple manuscripts, rather than on a single variant. Why translate from the Latin? Well, firstly John Greer, my co-translator, is an excellent Latinist, but neither of us has a sufficient grasp of medieval Arabic. However, what I do have is a mastery of traditional astrology. Picatrix is so heavily astrological that the non-expert is completely lost when it comes to making an intelligible translation. Some other translations, despite ostensibly being from Arabic, have suffered greatly from an almost complete lack of astrological knowledge, leaving large sections incoherent and incomprehensible.<br><br>By contrast, our translation of the Picatrix reveals its true sweep and splendor as Picatrix is both an exhaustive manual of practical astrological magic as well as an expansive treatise on the Hermetic philosophy of astrology, alchemy and magic. This translation includes an extensive introduction and copious annotations, over 450 footnotes for 309 pages of text!<br><br>Like Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy which relies heavily on it, Picatrix represents the distillation of many earlier works. Written circa AD 1000 in Moorish Spain and translated into Latin in 1256 at the court of the Castilian king Alphonso the Wise, Picatrix is an authentic ancient work. The author says he consulted over 200 books of magic, astrology and alchemy. Picatrix was and still remains the premier grimoire of astrological magic, the highest of high magic, combining, as it does, ceremonial magic with the precise timing of traditional astrology. Picatrix explains how to create hundreds of different types of astrological talismans, including planetary, Mansions of the Moon, decan/face and house based talismans. Picatrix includes extensive planetary invocations and ritual from the pagan Sabians of Harran, renowned medieval magicians and astrologers. Sublime Neoplatonic and Hermetic philosophy bumps shoulders with "confections" of the brain of a black dove or blood sacrifice.<br><br>We have been very careful to produce an authoritative translation of the Latin Picatrix, which will satisfy both scholarly interest as well as be of use to the contemporary practitioner. The various editions of the Picatrix, for example, this edition, the Liber Atratus, available through Amazon, or other editions, including the Liber Rubeus and Liber Viridis Green Magic edition, available through the Renaissance Astrology website, all have the same authoritative, complete translation of Picatrix, newly revised from our earlier versions. The separate editions have different formatting and fonts, and add to the complete translation, additional useful and interesting material.<br><br>Despite its popularity among mages, Picatrix was never published until the modern era. Finally, a complete, lucid and clear English translation is available!</p><h2>The Walking Dead: The Official Cookbook and Survival Guide</h2><p>Based on the hit AMC television series, this cookbook is packed with life-saving tips and unique recipes inspired by <i>The Walking Dead</i>. &nbsp;<br><br><i>The Walking Dead: The Official Cookbook and Survival Guide</i>&nbsp;details the skills and recipes you need to survive (while avoiding being eaten) during a walker apocalypse.

His parents named him Jacques. As he grew, Jacques fell in love with the sea. He dreamed of breathing beneath the waves and swimming as gracefully as a fish. In fact, he longed to become a manfish. Jacques Cousteau grew up to become a champion of the seas and one of the best-known oceanographers in the world. In this lovely biography, now in paperback, poetic text and gorgeous paintings come together to create a portrait of Cousteau that is as magical as it is inspiring.</p><p>Jennifer Berne is the author of the acclaimed <em>On a Beam of Light</em>.

And water made him wonder. He wondered why ships floated. Why he floated.&#x201d; Puybaret&#x2019;s smooth-looking&nbsp;acrylic paintings extend the words&#x2019; elegant simplicity and beautifully convey the sense of infinite, underwater space; and an inventive format further reinforces the text: a bisected scene shows a diver&#x2019;s waterline view above and below the surface; a series of panels depicts Cousteau and his friends learning to dive progressively deeper; and a gatefold dramatically suggests deep-sea depth. A closing scene, coated in sooty grays, describes how human activity has damaged sea life;&nbsp;and in a final, inspiring message, Berne&nbsp;calls for young people to become caring stewards of the earth.

At Yardbird in Hong Kong, Canadian chef Matt Abergel has put yakitori on the global culinary map. Here, in vivid style, with strong visual references to Abergel's passion for skateboarding, he reveals the magic behind the restaurant's signature recipes, together with detailed explanations of how they source, butcher, skewer, and cook the birds with no need for special equipment. Fire up the grill, and enjoy. The first comprehensive book about yakitori to be published in English, this book will appeal to home cooks and professional chefs alike.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Matt Abergel, an authority on yakitori chicken, is the head chef of Hong Kong-based restaurants Yardbird and Ronin. Having worked at Masayoshi Takayama's Masa in New York and at Hong Kong's Zuma, Abergel opened Yardbird in Hong Kong in 2011. He plans to open a yakitori restaurant in Los Angeles in 2019.</p><p>"Since it opened in 2011, there's no question that Yardbird has earned itself a cult following not just in Hong Kong, but around the world. It's not hard to see why. The vibe is good, the drinks are always flowing, the food is deliciously simple and always prepared with respect - for both the ingredients and for the art of yakitori, the time-honoured Japanese cooking technique in which chicken skewers are grilled over binchotan charcoal and enjoyed with an ice cold beer, sake or cocktail... <i>Chicken and Charcoal</i>, the first ever book about Yardbird (Hong Kong)[...] delves into the restaurant's journey from humble beginnings to the culinary phenomenon it is today. It includes everything from a step-by-step guide to Abergel's grilling techniques, recipes for their signature cocktails, as well as chapters that explain the art of sourcing and butchering... With high praise coming from all corners [...] the restaurant's influence is undeniable, and <i>Chicken and Charcoal</i> perfectly captures the soul of this buzzing Hong Kong hotspot."&#x2014;<i>AsiaTatler.com</i></p><p>"Matt Abergel, of Hong Kong restaurant Yardbird, has joined the ranks of chef-authors Ferran Adri�, Ren� Redzepi, Andre Chiang and Magnus Nilsson with the publication of his first book of recipes by Phaidon.

With its own unique style and strong visual references by artist Evan Hecox, the book reveals the magic behind the restaurant's food and drinks as well as the story of where Yardbird, Hong Kong started, how it grew, and where it is today."&#x2014;<i>The Nation online (Thailand)</i></p><p>"Matt Abergel has always loved chicken. The Vancouverite skateboarder-turned 'anti-cool' co-founder of Yardbird (Hong Kong's hottest chicken joint) has an almost spiritual connection with the humble bird... A new cookbook published by Phaidon documents Abergel's rise to cross-continental finger-lickin' fame, and treats us to behind-the-scenes workings, recipes and charcoal cookery tricks... The tome is a sensory joy. Complete with functional, graphic depictions of butchery, alongside elegant food photography of Yardbird (Hong Kong)'s modern classics, and notes from the 'under-designed' restaurant interiors, we discover hidden depths to the Yakitori cookery technique Abergel specialises in... The equally flavourful graphic identity is the work of longtime Yardbird collaborator (and fellow skateboard enthusiast) Evan Hecox. His understated, tattoo-like sketches and diagrams are imbued with youth-cultural motifs, and his collages of Hong Kong (Hong Kong) help to make <i>Chicken and Charcoal</i> more than just a recipe book, but a snapshot of a culinary moment, that defies cultures, backgrounds and tastes.

Japanese food is a favorite of diners around the world. Not only is sushi as much a part of the Western culinary scene as burgers, bagels and burritos, but some Japanese chefs have become household names. Japanese flavors, ingredients and textures have been fused into dishes from a wide variety of other cuisines. What hasn&#x2019;t changed over the years, however, are the foundations of Japanese cooking. When he originally wrote <i>Japanese Cooking</i>: A Simple Art, Shizuo Tsuji, a scholar who trained under famous European chefs, was so careful and precise in his descriptions of the cuisine and its vital philosophies, and so thoughtful in his choice of dishes and recipes, that his words&#x2014;and the dishes they help produce&#x2014;are as fresh today as when they were first written.<br>The 25th Anniversary edition celebrates Tsuji&#x2019;s classic work. Building on M. F. K. Fisher&#x2019;s eloquent introduction, the volume now includes a thought-provoking new Foreword by Gourmet Editor-in-Chief Ruth Reichl and a new Preface by the author&#x2019;s son and Tsuji Culinary Institute Director, Yoshiki Tsuji. Beautifully illustrated with eight pages of new color photos and over 500 drawings, and containing 230 traditional recipes as well as detailed explanations of ingredients, kitchen utensils, techniques and cultural aspects of Japanese cuisine, this edition continues the Tsuji legacy of bringing the Japanese kitchen within the reach of Western cooks.</p><p><b>SHIZUO TSUJI</b> (1935-1993) was the former head of the prestigious Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka, the largest school training professional chefs in Japan. The author of over 30 books on gastronomy, travel and music, he was a leading figure in the international culinary community. <i>Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art</i> was instrumental in popularizing Japanese cuisine in the West. Tsuji was also the author of Kodansha&#x2019;s bestselling <i>Practical Japanese Cooking</i>.Easily the most comprehensive and exhaustive look at Japanese cuisine available, this groundbreaking classic marks its quarter-century anniversary in a revised edition with a new foreword by <i>Gourmet</i> editor-in-chief Ruth Reichl and a new preface by the late Tsuji's son, Yoshiki Tsuji. Part cookbook, part philosophical treatise, this highly acclaimed collection offers a wealth of insight for amateurs and experts alike. Every technique associated with Japanese food is described step by step in great detail, along with illustrations to guide the reader through everything from filleting fish or cleaning an octopus to rolling omelets. Sections on the Japanese meal, ingredients and selecting and cutting fish, chicken and vegetables offer great insight into the culture as well as the food. The recipe section of the book is divided by cooking method rather than food type, including grilled and pan-fried, steamed, simmered and deep-fried. Dishes range from the simple, Pan-Broiled Salmon, to the more complex, Nagasaki-Style Braised Pork, and many dishes are vegetarian. Sushi and sashimi are covered in depth, as are knives, the proper way to slice the fish, and decorative presentations. A complete guide to Japanese cooking, this collection is must-have for anyone interested in Japanese food or culture. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is the author of the Prey novels, the Kidd novels, the Virgil Flowers novels, <i>The Night Crew</i>, and <i>Dead Watch. </i>He lives in New Mexico.<b>1</b>The wind whistled down the frozen run of ShastaCreek, between the blacker-than-black walls of pine. Thethin naked swamp alders and slight new birches bentbefore it. Needle-point ice crystals rode it, like sandpapergrit, carving arabesque whorls in the drifting snow. <p>The Iceman followed the creek down to the lake, navigatingas much by feel, and by time, as by sight. At six minuteson the luminous dial of his dive watch, he began tolook for the dead pine. Twenty seconds later, its weather-bleachedtrunk appeared in the snowmobile headlights,hung there for a moment, then slipped away like a hitchhikingghost. </p><p>Now. Six hundred yards, compass bearing 270 degrees. . .</p><p><i>Time time time </i> . . . </p><p>He almost hit the lake&#x2019;s west bank as it came down fromthe house, white-on-white, rising in front of him. Heswerved, slowed, followed it. The artificial blue of a yardlight burrowed through the falling snow, and he eased thesled up onto the bank and cut the engine. </p><p>The Iceman pushed his faceplate up, sat and listened.He heard nothing but the pat of the snow off his suit andhelmet, the ticking of the cooling engine, his own breathing,and the wind. He was wearing a full-face woolen skimask with holes for his eyes and mouth. The snow caughton the soft wool, and after a moment, meltwater begantrickling from the eye holes down his face beside his nose.He was dressed for the weather and the ride: the snowmobilesuit was windproof and insulated, the legs fitting intohis heavyweight pac boots, the wrists overlapped by expeditionski mitts. A heavyweight polypropylene turtleneckoverlapped the face mask, and the collar of the suitsnapped directly to the black helmet. He was virtually encapsulatedin nylon and wool, and still the cold pried at thecracks and thinner spots, took away his breath . . . </p><p>A set of Bearpaw snowshoes was strapped behindthe seat, on the sled&#x2019;s carry-rack, along with a corn-knifewrapped in newspaper. He swiveled to a sidesaddle position,keeping his weight on the machine, fumbled a miniaturemilled-aluminum flashlight out of his parka pocket,and pointed it at the carry-rack. His mittens were too thickto work with, and he pulled them off, letting them danglefrom his cuff-clips. </p><p>The wind was an ice pick, hacking at his exposed fingersas he pulled the snowshoes free. He dropped them onto thesnow, stepped into the quick-release bindings, snapped thebindings and thrust his hands back into the mittens. They&#x2019;dbeen exposed for less than a minute, and already felt stiff. </p><p>With his mittens on, he stood up, testing the snow. Thelatest fall was soft, but the bitter cold had solidified the layersbeneath it. He sank no more than two or three inches.Good. </p><p>The chimes sounded in his mind again: Time. </p><p>He paused, calmed himself. The whole intricate clockworkof his existence was in danger. He&#x2019;d killed once already,but that had been almost accidental. He&#x2019;d had toimprovise a suicide scene around the corpse. </p><p>And it had almost worked. </p><p><i>Had </i> worked well enough to eliminate any chance thatthey might catch him. That experience changed him, gavehim a taste of blood, a taste of <i>real </i> power. </p><p>The Iceman tipped his head back like a dog testing forscent. The house was a hundred feet farther along the lakeshore. He couldn&#x2019;t see it; except for the distant glow of theyard light, he was in a bowl of darkness. He pulled the cornknife free of the carry-rack and started up the slope. Thecorn-knife was a simple instrument, but perfect for an ambushon a snowy night, if the chance should present itself. </p><p>In a storm, and especially at night, Claudia LaCourt&#x2019;shouse seemed to slide out to the edge of the world. As thesnow grew heavier, the lights across the frozen lake slowlyfaded and then, one by one, blinked out. </p><p>At the same time, the forest pressed in: the pine andspruce tiptoed closer, to bend over the house with an unbearableweight. The arbor vitae would paw at the windows,the bare birch branches would scratch at the eaves.All together they sounded like the maundering approachof something wicked, a beast with claws and fangs that rattledon the clapboard siding, searching for a grip. A beastthat might pry the house apart. </p><p>When she was home alone, or alone with Lisa, Claudiaplayed her old Tammy Wynette albums or listened to thetelevision game shows. But the storm would always comethrough, with a thump or a screech. Or a line would godown somewhere: the lights would stutter and go out, themusic would stop, everybody would hold their breath . . .and the storm would be there, clawing. Candlelight made itworse; hurricane lanterns didn&#x2019;t help much. For the kinds ofwickedness created by the imagination during a nighttimeblizzard, only modern science could fight: satellite-dish television,radio, compact disks, telephones, computer games.Power drills. Things that made machine noise. Things thatbanished the dark-age claws that pried at the house. </p><p>Claudia stood at the sink, rinsing coffee cups and stackingthem to dry. Her image was reflected in the windowover the sink, as in a mirror, but darker in the eyes, darkerin the lines that framed her face, like an old daguerreotype. </p><p>From outside, she&#x2019;d be a madonna in a painting, the onlysign of light and life in the blizzard; but she never thoughtof herself as a madonna. She was a Mom with a still-shapelybutt and hair done with a red rinse, an easy sense of humor,and a taste for beer. She could run a fishing boat and swinga softball bat and once or twice a winter, with Lisa stayingover at a friend&#x2019;s, she and Frank would drive into Grant andcheck into the Holiday Inn. The rooms had floor-to-ceilingmirrors on the closet doors next to the bed. She <i>did </i> like tosit on his hips and watch herself fuck, her head thrown backand her breasts a burning pink. </p><p>Claudia scraped the last of the burnt crust from the cupcaketin, rinsed it and dumped it in the dish rack to air-dry.</p><p>A branch scraped against the window. She looked out,but without the chill: she was humming to herself, somethingold, something high school. Tonight, at least, sheand Lisa weren&#x2019;t alone. Frank was here. In fact, he was onthe stairs, coming up, and he was humming to <i>himself</i>.They did that frequently, the same things at the same time. </p><p> &#x201c;Um,&#x201d; he said, and she turned. His thinning black hairfell over his dark eyes. He looked like a cowboy, shethought, with his high cheekbones and the battered TonyLamas poking out of his boot-cut jeans. He was wearing atattered denim shop apron over a T-shirt and held a paintbrushslashed with blood-red lacquer. </p><p> &#x201c;Um, what?&#x201d; Claudia asked. This was the second marriagefor each of them. They were both a little beat-up andthey liked each other a lot. </p><p> &#x201c;I just got started on the bookcase and I rememberedthat I let the woodstove go,&#x201d; he said ruefully. He waggledthe paintbrush at her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s gonna take me another hour tofinish the bookcase. I really can&#x2019;t stop with this lacquer.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Goddammit, Frank . . .&#x201d; She rolled her eyes. </p><p> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; Moderately penitent, in a charming cowboyway. </p><p> &#x201c;How about the sheriff?&#x201d; she asked. New topic. &#x201c;Areyou still gonna do it?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see him tomorrow,&#x201d; he said. He turned his head, refusingto meet her eyes. </p><p> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing but trouble,&#x201d; she said. The argument hadbeen simmering between them. She stepped away from thesink and bent backwards, to look down the hall towardLisa&#x2019;s room. The girl&#x2019;s door was closed and the faint soundsof Guns &#x2019;N Roses leaked out around the edges. Claudia&#x2019;svoice grew sharper, worried. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d just shut up . . . It&#x2019;s<i>not </i> your responsibility, Frank. You <i>told </i> Harper about it. Jimwas <i>his </i> boy. <i>If </i> it&#x2019;s Jim.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Jim, all right. And I told you how Harper acted.&#x201d;Frank&#x2019;s mouth closed in a narrow, tight line. Claudiarecognized the expression, knew he wouldn&#x2019;t change hismind. Like what&#x2019;s-his-name, in <i>High Noon</i>. Gary Cooper. </p><p> &#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d never seen the picture,&#x201d; she said, droppingher head. Her right hand went to her temple, rubbing it.Lisa had taken her back to her bedroom to give it to her.Didn&#x2019;t want Frank to see it. </p><p> &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t just let it lay,&#x201d; Frank insisted. &#x201c;I told Harperthat.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be trouble, Frank,&#x201d; Claudia said. </p><p> &#x201c;And the law can handle it. It don&#x2019;t have nothing to dowith us,&#x201d; he said. After a moment he asked, &#x201c;Will you getthe stove?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Yeah, yeah. I&#x2019;ll get the stove.&#x201d; </p><p>Claudia looked out the window toward the mercury-vaporyard light down by the garage. The snow seemed tocome from a point just below the light, as though it werebeing poured through a funnel, straight into the window,straight into her eyes. Small pellets, like birdshot. &#x201c;It lookslike it might be slowing down.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t supposed to snow at all,&#x201d; Frank said. &#x201c;Assholes.&#x201d; </p><p>He meant television weathermen. The weathermen saidit would be clear and cold in Ojibway County, and herethey were, snowing to beat the band. </p><p> &#x201c;Think about letting it go.&#x201d; She was pleading now.&#x201c;Just think about it.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it,&#x201d; he said, and he turned and wentback down to the basement. </p><p>He might think about it, but he wouldn&#x2019;t change hismind. Claudia, turning the picture in her mind, put on asweatshirt and walked out to the mudroom. Frank hadgotten his driving gloves wet and had draped them overthe furnace vent; the room smelled of heat-dried wool.She pulled on her parka and a stocking cap, picked up hergloves, turned on the porch lights from the switch insidethe mudroom and stepped out into the storm. </p><p>The picture. The people might have been anybody,from Los Angeles or Miami, where they did these things.They weren&#x2019;t. </p><p>They were from Lincoln County. The printing was badand the paper was so cheap it almost crumbled in your fingers.But it was the Harper boy, all right. If you lookedclose, you could see the stub of the finger on the left hand,the one he&#x2019;d caught in a log splitter; and you could seethe loop earring. He was naked on a bed, his hips toward thecamera, a dulled, wondering look on his face. He had thethickening face of an adolescent, but she could still seethe shadow of a little boy she&#x2019;d known, working at hisfather&#x2019;s gas station. </p><p>In the foreground of the picture was the torso of anadult man, hairy-chested, gross. The image came tooquickly to Claudia&#x2019;s mind; she was familiar enough withmen and their physical mechanisms, but there was somethingabout this, something so bad . . . the boy&#x2019;s eyes,caught in a flash, were black points. When she&#x2019;d lookedclosely, it seemed that somebody at the magazine had putthe pupils in with a felt-tipped pen. </p>She shivered, not from the cold, and hurried downthe snow-blown trench that led out to the garage andwoodshed. There were four inches of new snow in thetrench: she&#x2019;d have to blow it out again in the morning. <p></p><p>The trench ended at the garage door. She shoved thedoor open, stepped inside, snapped on the lights andstomped her feet without thinking. The garage was insulatedand heated with a woodstove. Four good chunksof oak would burn slowly enough, and throw off enoughheat, to keep the inside temperature above the freezingpoint on even the coldest nights. Warm enough to start thecars, anyway. Out here, in the Chequamegon, getting thecars to start could be a matter of life and death. </p><p>The stove was still hot. Down to coals, but Frank hadcleaned it out the night before&#x2014;she wouldn&#x2019;t have to dothat, anyway. She looked back toward the door, at thewoodpile. Enough for the night, but no more. She tossed afew wrist-thin splits of sap-heavy pine onto the fire, to getsome flame going, then four solid chunks of oak. Thatwould do it. </p><p>She looked at the space where the woodpile should havebeen, sighed, and decided she might as well bring in a fewchunks now&#x2014;give it a chance to thaw before morning. Shewent back outside, pulling the door shut, but not latched,walked along the side of the garage to the lean-to that coveredthe woodpile. She picked up four more chunks of oak,staggered back to the garage door, pushed the door openwith her foot and dropped the oak next to the stove. Onemore trip, she thought; Frank could do his share tomorrow.</p><p>She went back out to the side of the garage, into thedark of the woodshed, picked up two more pieces of oak. </p><p>And felt the short hairs rise on the back of her neck. </p><p><i>Somebody was here with her . . .</i></p><p>Claudia dropped the oak splits, one gloved hand goingto her throat. The woodlot was dark beyond the back ofthe garage. She could feel it, but not see it, could hear herheart pounding in her ears, and the snow hitting her hoodwith a delicate pit-put-pit. Nothing else: but still . . . </p><p>She backed away. Nothing but the snow and the bluecircle of the yard light. At the snow-blown trench, shepaused, straining into the dark . . . and ran.Up to the house, still with the sense of someone behindher, his hand almost there, reaching for her. She pawed atthe door handle, smashed it down, hit the door with theheel of her hand, followed it into the heat and light of themudroom. </p><p> &#x201c;Claudia?&#x201d; </p><p>She screamed.Frank stood there, with a paint rag, eyes wide,startled. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;My God,&#x201d; she said. She pulled down the zip on thesnowmobile suit, struggled with the hood snaps, hermouth working, nothing coming out until: &#x201c;My God,Frank, there&#x2019;s somebody out there by the garage.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; He frowned and went to the kitchen window,looked out. &#x201c;Did you see him?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;No, but I swear to God, Frank, there&#x2019;s somebody outthere. I could feel him,&#x201d; she said, catching his arm, lookingpast him through the window. &#x201c;Call nine-one-one.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything,&#x201d; Frank said. He went through thekitchen, bent over the sink, looked out toward the yardlight. </p><p> &#x201c;You <i>can&#x2019;t </i> see anything,&#x201d; Claudia said. She flipped thelock on the door, then stepped into the kitchen. &#x201c;Frank, Iswear to God there&#x2019;s somebody . . .&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he said. He took her seriously: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go look.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we call . . . ?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take a look,&#x201d; he said again. Then: &#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;tsend a cop out here, in this storm. Not if you didn&#x2019;t evensee anybody.&#x201d; </p><p>He was right. Claudia followed him into the mudroom,heard herself babbling: &#x201c;I loaded up the stove, then I wentaround to the side to bring some wood in for tomorrowmorning . . .&#x201d; and she thought, <i>I&#x2019;m not like this</i>. </p><p>Frank sat on the mudroom bench and pulled off theTony Lamas, stepped into his snowmobile suit, sat down,pulled on his pacs, laced them, then zipped the suit andpicked up his gloves. &#x201c;Back in a minute,&#x201d; he said. Hesounded exasperated; but he knew her. She wasn&#x2019;t one topanic. </p><p> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come,&#x201d; she blurted. </p><p> &#x201c;Nah, you wait,&#x201d; he said. </p><p> &#x201c;Frank: take the gun.&#x201d; She hurried over to the serviceisland, jerked open the drawer. Way at the back, a fullyloaded Smith and Wesson .357 Magnum snuggled behinda divider. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s Harper. Maybe . . .&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; he said, shaking his head. He grinned at herruefully, and he was out the door, pulling on his ski gloves. </p><p>On the stoop, the snow pecked his face, mean little hardpellets. He half-turned against it. As long as he wasn&#x2019;tlooking directly into the wind, the snowmobile suit kepthim comfortable. But he couldn&#x2019;t see much, or hear anythingbut the sound of th...</p></p><h2>The Complete Chi&#39;s Sweet Home 4</h2><p><b>Fur the Well!<br><br></b>After six years in North America the Chi's Sweet Home saga has finally come to an end!

Niceness keeps the peace, wins friends, gains influence, and serves our reputations well, but it also takes the teeth out of our witness and the power out of our faith.

But joy often gave way to sorrow as she invested her heart fully in walking alongside people in the grip of poverty, addiction, desperation, and disease.<br> &nbsp;<br> After unexpected tragedy shook her family, for the first time Katie began to wonder, <i>Is God really good? Does He really love us? </i>When she turned to Him with her questions, God spoke truth to her heart and drew her even deeper into relationship with Him. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Daring to Hope</i> is an invitation to cling to the God of the impossible&#x2014;the God who whispers His love to us in the quiet, in the mundane, when our prayers are not answered the way we want or the miracle doesn&#x2019;t come. It&#x2019;s about a mother discovering the extraordinary strength it takes to be ordinary. It&#x2019;s about choosing faith no matter the circumstance and about encountering God&#x2019;s goodness in the least expected places. <br> &nbsp;<br> Though your heartaches and dreams may take a different shape, you will find your own questions echoed in these pages. You&#x2019;ll be reminded of the gifts of joy in the midst of sorrow. And you&#x2019;ll hear God&#x2019;s whisper:<i> Hold on to hope. I will meet you here.</i></p><p>Katie Davis Majors moved to Uganda over a decade ago with no idea that this would be the place that God chose to build her home and her family. Today, she is a wife to Benji and mom to her fourteen favorite people.

She is also the founder of Amazima Ministries, an organization that cares for vulnerable children and families in Uganda and the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Kisses from Katie.</i><p>1</p><p>An Invitation to Hope</p><p>My kitchen is painted yellow. Because yellow is the color of sunshine and of joy and because yellow is my favorite.</p><p>It&#x2019;s never quite as clean as I want it to be in here. As I stand in the after-bedtime quiet, my eyes follow a trail of red-dirt footprints across this floor that is supposed to be white, and tears of gratitude begin to well. My mind fills with beloved memories, so many memories that are held here.</p><p>This kitchen, this is where I serve. Many days, this kitchen is where I live. The window above the sink looks out over the backyard, all the way to the garden, where the corn climbs high and children hide among sunflowers and sugar cane stalks. It looks out at the mango tree that my girls often hang from, all happy and limbs flailing as I pretend I am not worried that they will fall. I have a baker&#x2019;s dozen I call my own, little girls who are turning into young women more rapidly than I would like, each one knit into our family by the impossibly beautiful, impossibly hard miracle of adoption.</p><p>I stand at this window, sometimes for what feels like the majority of the day, and wash dishes and rinse vegetables for dinner and sing worship. The back door is next to the sink, and children trail in and out, their endless questions and loud laughter and muddy footprints filling our home with joy. It sounds rather magical, doesn&#x2019;t it? It can be.</p><p>And sometimes it isn&#x2019;t. Children bicker and this mama loses her temper and the bread burns in the oven and things can unravel quite quickly.</p><p>These counters, nicked and crumb covered, the sink, one side piled high with drying dishes, they could tell some stories. They&#x2019;ve seen my joy as I gaze out the window at my laughing brood and raise my soapy hands high in praise. They&#x2019;ve seen tears fall in defeat over seemingly helpless situations as I peel a pile of potatoes and recite psalms to calm my heart. They&#x2019;ve heard my tongue zing words of exasperation as another child yells playfully through the house and my whispered repentance later as I beg God to make me into the mother I long to be. These yellow walls have held late-night laughter with dear friends and early-morning remorse over broken dreams. They&#x2019;ve witnessed confessions and achievements and the prayers of so many aching hearts, including mine.</p><p>This kitchen is where I returned in defeat the night I came home without the four-year-old foster daughter I had fought for. Sweet friends gathered around my daughters and me to make supper, and their silent labors meant more than words. I remember our first Thanksgiving prepared in this kitchen, my mom pulling the stuffing out of the oven, kids dancing happy, and people&#x2014;oh so many people&#x2014;spilling joy to fill this small space. Here we&#x2019;ve played too-loud music and danced as we washed piles upon piles of dishes. Here I&#x2019;ve set foster babies on counters next to casseroles for neighbors. Here in this same kitchen, I&#x2019;ve stood exhausted in the wee-morning hours to whisk high-calorie milk for people clinging to life, and I&#x2019;ve cried out for Jesus to save them.</p><p>I stand here and let the memories flood my heart. In my mind&#x2019;s eye, I see little ones sitting on counters, watching me bake and eagerly waiting to stick their fingers into whatever it is I&#x2019;m concocting. I hear the pitter-patter of little feet over the bubbling of the coffeepot and the excited voice of my littlest as she announces that the chicks have &#x201c;popped&#x201d; in the first light of the morning, and I feel the way God&#x2019;s mercy has washed over me in this place. I see hundreds of cooking lessons, little bodies crowded around a big pot, eager for their chance to measure, to pour, to stir. I see birthday cakes&#x2014;so many birthday cakes&#x2014;frosted and decorated with butterflies and flowers. I smell whole-wheat bread, warm and rising in this oven, daily, and I marvel at how He has been our daily bread.</p><p>I think of people, all the people who have filled this place over the years. Through the conversations and prayer and comfort of this kitchen, homeless mothers have found their ways to better lives, children have been healed and become whole, friends have found rest, and people I have loved have loved me right back. People have known the Lord in this place. I have known the Lord in this place.</p><p>I run my fingers over knife-worn counters, and time runs too fast. People are sent out from here. People heading home and people heading off to new futures. One day these girls, too, will head into their own futures. It&#x2019;s almost too much, this passing of time, the dying of dreams and the budding of new ones, this growing of babies into children and children into women and hearts to maturity. And I cry because I want to hold it all forever, the Lord&#x2019;s goodness in this place.</p><p>I have laughed here, I have wept here, I have created here, and oh, I have prayed here. And in this place, I have known Him more. I haven&#x2019;t always done it right, and some days I feel that I haven&#x2019;t been enough, but I know that He has. He has.</p><p>Directly above the oven are painted these words of Acts: &#x201c;They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts.... And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.&#x201d;1 This is my deep desire. I know it like I know my own breath: time passes, and these people will go, heading off to new places and new futures, and only He will remain. I serve meals in this kitchen, but I want to serve what really counts. I want to offer all who pass through this place the Living Bread, the only food that truly fills.</p><p>My eyes find the trail of footprints leading to the door, and through bated breath I ask it, beg it, &#x201c;Lord, if I could have just one thing, could I serve them You?&#x201d;</p><p>***</p><p>Ten years ago I moved across the ocean, from Tennessee to Uganda, full of something that I thought was hope but in reality was more like naive optimism. If you had asked me then how the Lord might most deepen my relationship with Him, I would have had all kinds of answers. At the old and wise age of nineteen, I thought I knew some things. I was going to give my life away for Jesus. I was going to change lives by teaching people the Gospel of Christ and helping provide for their basic needs. God was going to use me. I was going to be the answer.</p><p>I did not know the beauty that would find me in a life poured out for Him, the joy of calling little ones &#x201c;daughter&#x201d; and pressing into Him to learn what that really meant, the exhilaration of true and undefiled worship in a sea of people who did not speak the same language but worshipped the same God, the thrill of witnessing a life changed due to basic and simple provision of such things as medical care and nutritional assistance.</p><p>I did not know the pain that awaited me on the other side of the ocean, on the other side of humility, where I would recognize just how little I had to offer. I did not know that a baby girl would call me &#x201c;Mommy&#x201d; for years and then I would have to give her up. I did not know that I would carry the responsibility of looking into a mother&#x2019;s face and telling her that her child was not going to live. I did not know that I would forge deep friendships with people imprisoned by addiction I could not help them fight no matter how I tried. I did not know that I would provide care, for months at a time, for people living with HIV, desperately begging God to spare their lives, only to later find myself holding their hands as they slipped into eternity with Him on the other side.</p><p>And I did not know that in the middle of much pain and grief and loss, I would experience a joy and a peace that far surpassed human understanding. Reality would shatter my optimism, but I would realize that my positivity was only a cheap substitute for true hope anyway. The Lord would take the darkness and make it my secret place, the place where I knew Him more intimately and deeply than I had ever fathomed possible. In the middle of the hurricane that surrounded me, I would experience a true Comfort so deep, so clear, that it simply could not be denied. It was Jesus. He was near.</p><p>In our pain, He is near.</p><p>During sleepless nights and the death of friends and the breaking of families, Christ is all that remains constant and He is the only One who is sufficient. He holds my hands. He cups my face. He is near, and He whispers of a day when the pain is gone and I can fall on my face and worship Him forever.</p><p>Over the years, my packaged faith of all the right and wrong answers has been enveloped in a personal touch from the living God. My grief was His grief and my joy was His joy. In my darkness, I knew Him and He knew me. In the midst of pain I would not have chosen, He was real and undeniable and true. When life was not what I expected, where hope was not what I thought, He carved a space in my heart for Him.</p><p>This didn&#x2019;t make the pain easy. Some days, prayers seemed to go unanswered and loss overwhelmed our lives. I still laid prostrate on the bathroom floor and beat my hands against the hard tile and begged the Lord that I would not have to bury yet another friend. I still cried tears that threatened to take my breath away as I realized the depth of the suffering of the people around me, grief that would never end, not until Jesus comes back.</p><p>No, He didn&#x2019;t make the pain easy. But He made it beautiful. He held me close and whispered secrets to me and revealed things about Himself that I had not yet known. He scooped me into His big loving arms and held me in tenderness unlike any I had ever experienced.</p><p>I did not find all the answers to my questions. In fact, I might have more questions now than I did before. But I have found deep intimacy with the One who formed me and knows my heart. He has taught me His secrets in the darkness. He has taught me true and unwavering hope in Him.</p><p>***</p><p>Truly, this life is a far cry from the picture-perfect one I once imagined, with a few kids and a white picket fence. Our house isn&#x2019;t nearly as organized as I would like, and dinner is often late. We make a ruckus in the grocery store, and we don&#x2019;t get through all the schoolwork I intended for this week, ever. We are late to church and sometimes we get there and one doesn&#x2019;t have shoes and one forgot to comb her hair. We can be a bit of a mess, but we have a God who makes up for all we lack, a God who promises beauty for our ashes and streams in the desert and grace for today.</p><p>And I feel as though He has given me this promise: these days are sacred. God is good to us here and now, working all for our good, and He is daily peeling back the scales, opening my eyes to see. It&#x2019;s not what I once imagined; it&#x2019;s better.</p><p>Our house is always full, but it never really feels too small. Over the years we have made a habit, a lifestyle really, of opening the doors wide even when we feel like we can&#x2019;t possibly stretch any more, of making ourselves available to those God brings into our lives and seeing His goodness as we open our arms to Him and to others.</p><p>He always brings them. People flock here, for a glass of water, for a friendly smile, for a story of redemption, for a place to belong. He has filled our lives and our home with beautiful, broken people, and He has shown Himself to be God who mends the broken and uses the cracks to reveal His glory.</p><p>The stories I tell in these pages are not my own. They are the stories of many more faithful than I who have also known these things to be true. They are stories of those God has entrusted my heart with, and I pray my feeble words could honor them. They are stories full of truths that are not unique to me but are true for anyone who has known Jesus in the darkness and known even the dark season to be a gift.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a daunting task, to write it all down, to beg God for words that would truly point to only Him, to invite you in to see all of it, the good and the ugly, the joy and the pain, my heart bled out here on paper. But on the other side of this daunting task, on the other side of the risk of sharing my vulnerable heart with the whole crazy world, is the chance that you might see Jesus here, in our kitchen, here in our lives. And maybe you would see Jesus in our mess and in our brokenness and you would be encouraged that there is grace and purpose in your mess and brokenness as well.</p><p>And maybe you could read these words and know a real and true and enduring hope that can be found only in Jesus. A hope that met me in the places that I didn&#x2019;t expect, the places that I would not have chosen to walk through. A hope that was birthed amid pain and wreckage.</p><p>And so I invite you in to join us, dear one. Not because we have any answers, but because I know the One who does. The kitchen isn&#x2019;t big, but we will make room. Come on in. For a glass of cold water, for a friendly smile, for a story of redemption, for a place to belong. My most daring prayer is that you would find the Lord here, in the pages of our stories and, more so, in the pages of your own. He has been my companion in the most devastating trials and greatest joys. His deepest desire is to be yours, too.</p></p><h2>The Vanity Fair Diaries: Power, Wealth, Celebrity, and Dreams: My Years at the Magazine That Defined a Decade</h2><p><p><b>Named one of the best books of 2017 by <i>Time, </i><i>People, Amazon.com,</i><i> The Guardian, Paste Magazine, </i>&amp;<i> Vogue</i></b></p><p><b>Tina Brown kept delicious daily diaries throughout her eight spectacular years as editor-in-chief of <i>Vanity Fair</i>.

Summoned from London in hopes that she can save Cond� Nast's troubled new flagship <i>Vanity Fair</i>, Tina Brown is immediately plunged into the maelstrom of the competitive New York media world and the backstabbing rivalries at the court of the planet's slickest, most glamour-focused magazine company. She survives the politics, the intrigue, and the attempts to derail her by a simple stratagem: succeeding. In the face of rampant skepticism, she triumphantly reinvents a failing magazine.</p><p>Here are the inside stories of <i>Vanity Fair</i> scoops and covers that sold millions&#x2015;the Reagan kiss, the meltdown of Princess Diana's marriage to Prince Charles, the sensational Annie Leibovitz cover of a gloriously pregnant, naked Demi Moore. In the diary's cinematic pages, the drama, the comedy, and the struggle of running an "it" magazine come to life. Brown's <i>Vanity Fair Diaries</i> is also a woman's journey, of making a home in a new country and of the deep bonds with her husband, their prematurely born son, and their daughter.</p><p>Astute, open-hearted, often riotously funny, Tina Brown's <i>The Vanity Fair Diaries</i> is a compulsively fascinating and intimate chronicle of a woman's life in a glittering era.</p></p><p><b>TINA BROWN</b> is an award-winning writer and editor and founder of the Women in the World Summit. Between 1979 and 2001 she was the editor of <i>Tatler, Vanity Fair</i>, and <i>The New Yorker. </i>Her 2007 biography of the Princess of Wales, <i>The Diana Chronicles</i>, topped the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list. In 2008 she founded <i>The Daily Beast</i>, which won the Webby Award for Best News Site in 2012 and 2013.

Brown is a waspish, reliably slick writer&#x2015;her witty skewerings are first-class.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>The Times</i> (London)</b></p><p>&#x201c;A revelation . . . Brown is a woman of wondrous drive and ambition, arcing through the world as if fired from a cannon . . . There&#x2019;s swing in Brown&#x2019;s voice and vinegar in her pen . . . For legacy-media freaks, <i>The </i>Vanity Fair<i> Diaries</i> is a bound volume of crack.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Jennifer Senior, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The</i> Vanity Fair <i>Diaries</i> is the perfect stocking filler for any social x-ray who yearns to wallow in nostalgia. But even students of our own time will find the prescience of Brown&#x2019;s observations a source of amusement. The decade&#x2019;s greatest symbol, she observes, turned out to be not a person but a building: Trump Tower, &#x2018;the very definition of ersatz with its fool&#x2019;s gold fa�ade, its flashy internal waterfall, its dodgy financing.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Fiammetta Rocco, <i>The Economist</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;One of the pleasures of <i>The</i> Vanity Fair <i>Diaries</i>&#x2015;Tina Brown&#x2019;s wickedly sharp account of her years as editor of the magazine&#x2015;is her writing, the way she captures people with a few slashes of the pen.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Tina Jordan, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Her narrative is juicy in the mold less of a chophouse steak than of a summer peach: a little tart, a little sweet, mostly refreshing. It&#x2019;s pretty irresistible . . . She has a novelist&#x2019;s sense of pacing and a perverse genius for description . . . Her gift is to feel the big story emerging in the small, human detail.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Nathan Heller, <i>The New Yorker</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Brave, self-revealing real time-history . . . the kind of specific reporting that made Tina&#x2019;s <i>Vanity Fair</i> so juicy . . . Journalists will feast on it, but so too will anyone interested in media&#x2015;especially magazines and how they came and went. If you liked Tina Brown&#x2019;s <i>Vanity Fair</i> in the &#x2019;80s, her diary pages will sweep you back and even if you could get a little fed up with Tina back then, you will miss her now.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Terry McDonell, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Her eye gets its glinting acuity from her status as an outsider&#x2015;&#x2018;a cultural misfit,&#x2019; an expat both repelled and entranced by hyperbolic America.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Peter Conrad, <i>The Guardian</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The</i> Vanity Fair <i>Diaries</i> is a bound volume of crack. Brown may have been a complicated feminist figure.

Her most intimate observations&#x2015;about her marriage to fellow Brit editor Harry Evans; her concerns over their premature son, Georgie; the agony of watching talented young men die from AIDS&#x2015;elevate these Diaries beyond a mere New Gilded Age chronicle. As a well-educated Englishwoman in New York, Brown shows a novelistic flair in her descriptions of people, especially those she encounters at endless dinner parties, among them Manhattan&#x2019;s richest Trophy Wives. <b>&#x2015;Jocelyn McClurg, <i>USA Today</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Tina&#x2019;s singular voice immediately swept me up into the intoxicating, pulse-pounding energy of New York media culture in the &#x2018;80s&#x2015;the glittering social landscape, the thrill of creative rebirth and the relentless quest for success . . . Her diaries form a riveting, at-times-prophetic portrait of the opulent decade that shaped our modern media, told through the eyes of a woman who entered this world as an outsider but nevertheless smashed through professional barriers left and right.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Bruna Papandrea, <i>Shelf Awareness</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;A dishy tell-all . . .

Now, she finally has a friend. But the big, bad robots are coming to collect the little guy for nefarious purposes, and it's all up to a five-year-old armed only with a wrench and a fierce loyalty to her mechanical friend to save the day!</p><p>In the Eisner-winning graphic novel, <i>Little Robot</i>, <i>New York Times</i> Bestselling author Ben Hatke brings his signature sweetness to a simple, moving story about friendship and overcoming fears that will appeal to readers of all ages.</p></p><p><p><b>Ben Hatke</b> is the author and illustrator of the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling <i>Zita the Spacegirl </i>graphic novel trilogy and the picture book <i>Julia's House for Lost Creatures. </i>He lives and works in the Shenandoah Valley with his wife and their boisterous pack of daughters. His latest book is <i>Little Robot</i>.</p>Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;Once again Hatke delivers a delightful graphic novel with a positive female role-model, fun non-humans, and a message of friendship. When a brown-skinned cherubic girl chances upon a robot that looks like a trash can, she finds a friend worth protecting. Each day they explore the junkyard and the surrounding forest, with the little girl acting as a guide to new sights and concepts. Both love playing together, but when the robot wants to leave, things go downhill. It is up to this resourceful girl to save him from the bad bots of the factory. With her trusty wrench in hand, she repairs parts, builds traps, and fixes hearts. Like the characters in the movie Wall-E, these robots have a limited range of facial expressions, so they "speak" and emote in sound effects. Changes in font size, punctuation, and position play just as large a role in comprehension as body language and composition. It's Hatke's skill in communicating the narrative and emotional complexities through visual cues that makes this such a strong offering. Though the girl and her bot start their journeys separately and in silence, by the end, music and friends surround them. Young readers, and those new to graphica, will find the easy-to-follow illustrations, large borderless panels, and steady pace welcoming. VERDICT A pleasantly colorful adventure of discovery and friendship. Highly recommended.&#x2014;Rachel Forbes, Oakville Public Library, Ontario, Canada</p><h2>Stuck in Neutral (Stuck in Neutral, 1)</h2><p><p>Shawn McDaniel's life is not what it may seem to anyone looking at him. He is glued to his wheelchair, unable to voluntarily move a muscle&#x2014;he can't even move his eyes. For all Shawn's father knows, his son may be suffering. Shawn may want a release. And as long as he is unable to communicate his true feelings to his father, Shawn's life is in danger.</p><p>To the world, Shawn's senses seem dead. Within these pages, however, we meet a side of him that no one else has seen&#x2014;a spirit that is rich beyond imagining, breathing life.</p><p>The paperback features an Extras section, giving readers even more insight into Shawn's life, and includes a Q&amp;A with Terry Trueman, as well as a sneak peek at the sequel to <em>Stuck in Neutral</em>, <em>Life Happens Next</em>.</p><p>Supports the Common Core State Standards</p></p><p>Fourteen-year-old Shawn McDaniel loves the taste of smoked oysters and his mother's gentle hugs. Unfortunately, it's impossible for Shawn to feed himself or to hug his mom back. Shawn has cerebral palsy, a condition he has had since birth that has robbed him of all muscle control. He can't walk, talk, or even focus his eyes on his own. But despite all these handicaps, despite the frustration of not being able to communicate, Shawn is still happy to be alive: "Somehow all the things I think about and remember turn to joy... favorite movies... pinecones... chocolate pudding... the scent of Comet in a stainless steel sink.... Life can be great, even for me. Even for me." That is why he panics when he begins to suspect that his father is thinking of killing him. Shawn knows that his father is trying to be kind; he imagines that his son's life is an endless torment. His dad has no idea of the rich life that Shawn lives inside his head. And Shawn, helpless and mute, has no way of telling him.<p> <i>Stuck in Neutral</i> is a truly unique journey into the mind of a truly unique character. Shawn McDaniel, who is literally trapped in his own body, will serve as a powerful metaphor for teens who feel cornered by circumstances or their own physical shortcomings. Terry Trueman's first-person portrayal of Shawn is made all the more poignant by the fact that Trueman's own son, Henry, also suffers from cerebral palsy. This is an original and moving debut.

For the young Native American girl in Paul Goble's 1979 Caldecott-winning masterpiece, <i>The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses</i>, it is a blessing. Although she loves her people, this girl has a much deeper, almost sacred connection to her equine friends. The storm gives her the opportunity to fulfill her dream--to live in a beautiful land among the wild horses she loves.<p> With brilliant, stylized illustrations and simple text, Paul Goble tells the story of a young woman who follows her heart, and the family that respects and accepts her uniqueness. Considering how difficult it is for some communities to allow friendships to grow between people of different cultures, this village's support for the girl's companions of choice is admirable. Goble's bold paintings reflect this noble open-mindedness. The young horse fanatic of the house will joyfully add this book to his or her collection. Children are passionate people; they will relate.

She began to experience God mystically before she turned seven. Frequent visions of Christ, Mary, angels and saints inspired her holy, austere lifestyle and prompted her to take the habit of the Dominican Tertiaries at age 16, despite her parents' wish for her to marry and the untimely death of two of her sisters.<br><br> Enabled by a miracle to read and write, the formerly illiterate St. Catherine authored <i>The Dialogue of St. Catherine of Siena</i> and hundreds of letters asking for peace with the Papal States and the return of the Pope from Avignon to Rome. Her passionate yet humble pleas persuaded the Pope to return to Rome, where she herself died at the age of 33. She was canonized by Pope Pius II in 1461, and her feast is celebrated on April 29.</p><h2>Roomies</h2><p><b>From subway to Broadway to happily ever after.

I note how I have to shimmy with effort across the tacky seat, how there are millions of neglected fingerprints and unidentifiable smudges clouding the windows and Plexiglas barrier&#x2014;and how the floor of a cab is a really terrible place for a baby to meet the world.<br> <br>I slam the taxi door behind me to block out the howling Brooklyn wind. &#x201c;Fiftieth Street station, Manhattan.&#x201d;<br> <br>The driver&#x2019;s eyes meet mine in the rearview mirror and I can imagine what he&#x2019;s thinking: You want to take a cab to the subway in Manhattan? Lady, you could take the C train all the way there for three bucks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eighth Ave. and Forty-Ninth Street,&#x201d; I add, ignoring the clawing flush of awareness that I am absurd. Instead of taking the cab all the way home, I&#x2019;m having the driver take me from Park Slope to a subway stop in Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen, roughly two blocks from my building. It&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m particularly safety minded and don&#x2019;t want this cabbie to know where I live.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s that it&#x2019;s Monday, approximately eleven thirty, and Jack will be there.<br> <br>At least, he should be. Since I first saw him busking at the Fiftieth Street station nearly six months ago, he&#x2019;s been there every Monday night, along with Wednesday and Thursday mornings before work, and Friday at lunchtime. Tuesday he&#x2019;s gone, and I&#x2019;ve never seen him there on the weekend.<br> <br>Mondays are my favorite, though, because there&#x2019;s an intensity in the way he crouches over his guitar, cradling it, seducing it. Music that seems to have been trapped inside all weekend long is freed, broken only by the occasional metallic tumble of pocket change dropped into the open guitar case at his feet, or the roar of an approaching train.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know what he does in the hours he&#x2019;s not there. I&#x2019;m also fairly certain his name isn&#x2019;t Jack, but I needed to call him something other than &#x201c;the busker,&#x201d; and giving him a name made my obsession seem less pathetic.<br> <br>Sort of.<br> <br>The cabbie is quiet; he isn&#x2019;t even listening to talk radio or any of the other cacophonous car-filler every New Yorker gets used to. I blink away from my phone and the Instagram feed full of books and makeup tutorials, to the mess of sleet and slush on the roads. My cocktail buzz doesn&#x2019;t seem to be evaporating as quickly as I&#x2019;d hoped, and by the time we pull up to the curb and I pay the fare, I still have its giddy effervescence simmering in my blood.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve never come to see Jack while drunk before, and it&#x2019;s either a terrible or a fantastic idea. I guess we&#x2019;re about to find out which.<br> <br>Hitting the bottom of the stairs, I catch him tuning his guitar and stop a few feet away, studying him. With his head bowed, and in the beam of the streetlight shooting down the stairs, his light brown hair seems almost silver.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s suitably scruffy for our generation, but he looks clean, so I like to think he has a nice apartment and a regular, well-paying job, and does this because he loves it. He has the type of hair I can&#x2019;t resist, neat and trimmed along the sides but wild and untamed on top. It looks soft, too, shiny under the lights and the kind of hair you want to curl a fist around. I don&#x2019;t know what color his eyes are because he never looks up at anyone while he plays, but I like to imagine they&#x2019;re brown or dark green, a color deep enough to get lost in.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve never seen him arrive or leave, because I always walk past him, drop a dollar bill in his case, and keep moving. Then, covertly from the platform, I look over&#x2014;as do many of us&#x2014;to where he sits on his stool near the base of the stairs, his fingers flying up and down the neck of the instrument. His left hand pulls out the notes as if it&#x2019;s as simple as breathing.<br> <br>Breathing. As an aspiring writer, it&#x2019;s my least favorite clich�, but it&#x2019;s the only one that suits. I&#x2019;ve never seen someone&#x2019;s fingers move like that, as if he doesn&#x2019;t even have to think about it. In some ways, it seems like he gives the guitar an actual human voice.<br> <br>He looks up as I drop a bill into his case, squinting at me, and gives me a quiet &#x201c;Thanks very much.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;s never done that before&#x2014;looked up when someone dropped money in his case&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m caught completely off guard when our eyes meet.<br> <br>Green, his are green. And he doesn&#x2019;t immediately look away. The hold of his gaze is mesmerizing.<br> <br>So instead of saying, &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Sure&#x201d;&#x2014;or nothing at all, like any other New Yorker would&#x2014;I blurt, &#x201c;Iloveyourmusicsomuch.&#x201d; A string of words breathlessly said as one.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m gifted with the humblest flicker of a smile, and my tipsy brain nearly shorts out. He does this thing where he chews on his bottom lip for a second before saying, &#x201c;Do you reckon so? Well, you&#x2019;re very kind. I love to play it.&#x201d;<br> <br>His accent is heavily Irish, and the sound of it makes my fingers tingle.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>Three mortifying seconds pass before he answers with a surprised grin. &#x201c;Calvin. And yours?&#x201d;<br> <br>This is a conversation. Holy shit, I&#x2019;m having a conversation with the stranger I&#x2019;ve had a crush on for months.<br> <br>&#x201c;Holland,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Like the province in the Netherlands. Everyone thinks it&#x2019;s synonymous with the Netherlands, but it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Oof.<br> <br>Tonight, I&#x2019;ve concluded two things about gin: it tastes like pinecones and is clearly the devil&#x2019;s sauce.<br> <br>Calvin smiles up at me, saying cheekily, &#x201c;Holland. A province and a scholar,&#x201d; before he adds something quietly under his breath that I don&#x2019;t quite make out. I can&#x2019;t tell if the amused light in his eyes is because I&#x2019;m an entertaining idiot, or because there&#x2019;s a person directly behind me doing something awesome.<br> <br>Having not been on a date in what feels like a millennium, I also don&#x2019;t know where a conversation should go after this, so I bolt, practically sprinting the twenty feet to the platform. When I come to a halt, I dig in my purse with the practiced urgency of a woman who is used to pretending she has something critical she must obtain immediately.<br> <br>The word he whispered&#x2014;lovely&#x2014;registers about thirty seconds too late.<br> <br>He meant my name, I&#x2019;m sure. I&#x2019;m not saying that in a false-modesty kind of way. My best friend, Lulu, and I agree that, objectively, we&#x2019;re middle-of-the-pack women in Manhattan&#x2014;which is pretty great as soon as we leave New York. But Jack&#x2014;Calvin&#x2014;gets ogled by every manner of man and woman passing through the station&#x2014;from the Madison Avenue trustafarians slumming it on the subway to the scrappy students from Bay Ridge; honestly, he could have his pick of bed partners if he ever took the time to look up at our faces.<br> <br>To confirm my theory, a quick glance in my compact mirror reveals the clownish bleed of my mascara below my eyes and a particularly ghoulish lack of color in the bottom half of my face. I reach up and attempt to smooth the tangle of brown strands that every other moment of my life are straight and lifeless, but have presently escaped the confines of my ponytail and defy gravity around my head.<br> <br>Lovely, at present, I am not.<br> <br>Calvin&#x2019;s music returns, and it fills the quiet station in this echoing, haunting way that actually makes me feel even drunker than I thought I was. Why did I come here tonight? Why did I speak to him? Now I have to realign all these things in my brain, like his name not being Jack and his eyes having a defined color. The knowledge that he is Irish just about makes me feel crazy enough to go climb on his lap.<br> <br>Ugh. Crushes are the worst, but in hindsight a crush from afar seems so much easier than this. I should stick to making up stories in my head and watching from a distance like a reasonable creeper. Now I&#x2019;ve broken the fourth wall and if he&#x2019;s as friendly as his eyes tell me he is, he may notice me when I drop money in his case the next time, and I will be forced to interact smoothly or run in the opposite direction. I may be middle-of-the-pack when my mouth is closed, but as soon as I start talking to men, Lulu calls me Appalland, for how appallingly unappealing I become. Obviously, she&#x2019;s not wrong. And now I&#x2019;m sweating under my pink wool coat, my face is melting, and I&#x2019;m hit with an almost uncontrollable urge to hike my tights up to my armpits because they have slowly crept down beneath my skirt and are starting to feel like form-fitting harem pants.<br> <br>I should really go for it and just shimmy them up my waist, because other than one comatose gentleman sleeping on a nearby bench, it&#x2019;s just me and Calvin down here, and he&#x2019;s not paying attention to me anymore.<br> <br>But then the sleeping gentleman rises, zombielike, and takes one shuffling step toward me. Subway stations are awful when they&#x2019;re empty like this. They&#x2019;re caves for the leches, the harassers, the flashers. It isn&#x2019;t that late&#x2014;not even midnight on a Monday&#x2014;but I&#x2019;ve clearly just missed a train.<br> <br>I move to my left, farther down the platform, and pull out my phone to look busy. Alas, I should know that drunk and persistent men are often not swayed by the industrious presence of an iPhone, and the zombie comes closer.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s the tiny spike of fear in my chest or a draft passing through the station, but I&#x2019;m hit with the cloying, briny smell of mucus; the sour rot of spilled soda sitting for months at the bottom of a trash bin.<br> <br>He lifts a hand, pointing. &#x201c;You have my phone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Turning, I give him a wide berth as I circle back toward the stairs and Calvin. My thumb hovers over Robert&#x2019;s phone number.<br> <br>He follows. &#x201c;You. Come here. You have my phone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Without bothering to look up, I say as calmly as possible, &#x201c;Get the hell away from me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I push Robert&#x2019;s name and hold the phone to my ear. It rings hollowly, one ring for every five of my pounding heartbeats.<br> <br>Calvin&#x2019;s music swells, aggressively now. Does he not see this person following me around the station? I have the absurd thought that it really is remarkable how deeply he gets in the zone while playing.<br> <br>The man starts this shuffling, lurching run in my direction and the notes tearing out of Calvin&#x2019;s guitar become a soundtrack for the lunatic chasing me down the platform. My tights keep me from running with any amount of speed or grace, but his clunky run speeds up, turns more fluid with confidence.<br> <br>Through the phone, I hear the tinny sound of Robert answering. &#x201c;Hey, Buttercup.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Holy crap, Robert. I&#x2019;m at the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The man reaches out, his hand wrapping around the sleeve of my coat, jerking my phone away from my ear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Robert!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Holls?&#x201d; Robert yells. &#x201c;Honey, where are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I grapple, trying to hold on because I have the sickening sense that I&#x2019;m off balance. Dread sends a cold, sobering rush along my skin: the man is not helping me stay upright&#x2014;he&#x2019;s shoving me.<br> <br>In the distance, I hear a deep shout: &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d;<br> <br>My phone skitters along the concrete. &#x201c;Holland?&#x201d;<br> <br>It happens so fast&#x2014;and I guess things like this always happen fast; if they happened slowly I&#x2019;d like to think I&#x2019;d do something, anything&#x2014;but one second I&#x2019;m on the nubby yellow warning line, and the next I&#x2019;m falling onto the tracks.</p><h2>Healing and Recovery</h2><p>This, the eighth book in a progressive series based on the revelations of consciousness research, resulted from a group of lectures given by the author at the request of the original publisher of A Course in Miracles, along with members of several self-help groups, including Alcoholics Anonymous, ACIM, Attitudinal Healing Centers, other recovery groups, and a number of clinicians.Our society lives with constant stress, anxiety, fear, pain, suffering, depression, and worry.

In the moment, those situations require strength, patience, perseverance and courage. With time, those struggles provide us lessons for how to be better leaders. Bobby Herrera learned to see those struggles as gifts.<br>As the co-founder and CEO of Populus Group, Bobby never imagined the challenges of building a $500 million organization that serves tens of thousands of people. Throughout his life, he experienced the divergence between the intentional leader he wanted to be, and the less engaged version of him that showed up at the office every day. One day at a company meeting, he decided to share a story about one of his first struggles as a young adult. That story, a pivotal experience that had transformed Bobby's life, inspired his employees with its radical transparency, humility and the idealism of Bobby's dreams for the company.<br>In <em>The Gift of Struggle</em>, Bobby shares twelve of those stories from his leadership journey. Each chapter shares the details of the story, the broader lesson any leader can apply, a set of questions to reflect on, and an afterword for how the story later unfolded in Bobby's life. Building on Bobby's efforts, this book inspires readers to find their own stories, share their gifts of struggle with others, and become the leader they imagine they can be.</p><p>&#x201c;A powerful leadership book from the best CEO you&#x2019;ve never heard of.&#x201d;<br>-Patrick Lencino, author of the bestselling The Five Dysfunctions of A Team<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s refreshing to see a CEO so committed to create a winning culture.

But Snuff and his master are not alone. All manner of participants, both human and not, are gathering with their ancient tools and their animal familiars in preparation for the dread night. It is brave, devoted Snuff who must calculate the patterns of the Game and keep track of the Players&#x2014;the witch, the mad monk, the vengeful vicar, the Count who sleeps by day, the Good Doctor and the hulking Experiment Man he fashioned from human body parts, and a wild-card American named Larry Talbot&#x2014;all the while keeping Things at bay and staying a leap ahead of the Great Detective, who knows quite a bit more than he lets on.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boldly original and wildly entertaining,<i> A Night in the Lonesome October</i> is a darkly sparkling gem, an amalgam of horror, humor, mystery, and fantasy. First published in 1993, it was Zelazny&#x2019;s last book prior to his untimely death. Many consider it the best of the fantasy master&#x2019;s novels. It has inspired many fans to read it every year in October, a chapter a day, and served as inspiration for Neil Gaiman&#x2019;s brilliant story &#x201c;Only the End of the World Again.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p><b>Roger Zelazny</b> (1937&#x2013;1995) is best known as the author of the critically acclaimed Chronicles of Amber series. He wrote more than 40 novels and won the Nebula award three times and the Hugo award six times. <b>Gahan Wilson</b> is an award-winning author and cartoonist whose artwork has appeared in numerous publications, including <i>National Lampoon</i>, the <i>New Yorker</i>, and <i>Playboy</i>.</p>After years of unprepossessing folderol--the wearisome Nine Princes in Amber retreads are depressingly typical--Zelazny bursts forth with, well, ``Victorian light supernatural fantasy'' just about covers it. Narrator Snuff, a guard dog who performs complex thaumaturgical calculations in his head, has many duties: to keep various Things firmly trapped in mirrors, wardrobes, and steamer trunks; to accompany his master, Jack--he of the magical blade--on weird collecting expeditions into the graveyards and slums of Victorian London; and--for a single hour each night--discuss the day's goings-on in human speech. Snuff's neighbors include: Jill the witch and her familiar, Graymalk the cat, with whom Snuff forms a friendly alliance; Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Frankenstein, Dracula, a werewolf, and a satanic vicar. The witches, detectives, doctors, vampires, etc., along with their equally industrious familiars, trade information and scheme for advantage as the full moon of Halloween approaches; at that time, a magical showdown to decide the fate of the Earth will occur. Some of the characters are ``openers,'' determined to open a magical doorway allowing the Old Gods to reoccupy the Earth; others are ``closers,'' equally resolved to keep the magical door nailed shut; and a few are involved yet stand outside the Game altogether. Snuff's problem is to discover who is which. Sparkling, witty, delightful: Zelazny's best for ages, perhaps his best ever. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A cyber-enigma with an enthusiastic following, it pops up in headlines and fuels endless media debate. You can apparently use it to buy anything from coffee to cars, yet few people seem to truly understand what it is. This raises the question: Why should anyone care about bitcoin? </p><p>In <i>The Age of Cryptocurrency</i>, Wall Street journalists Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey deliver the definitive answer to this question. Cybermoney is poised to launch a revolution, one that could reinvent traditional financial and social structures while bringing the world's billions of "unbanked" individuals into a new global economy. Cryptocurrency holds the promise of a financial system without a middleman, one owned by the people who use it and one safeguarded from the devastation of a 2008-type crash. </p><p>But bitcoin, the most famous of the cybermonies, carries a reputation for instability, wild fluctuation, and illicit business; some fear it has the power to eliminate jobs and to upend the concept of a nation-state. It implies, above all, monumental and wide-reaching change&#x2015;for better and for worse. But it is here to stay, and you ignore it at your peril.</p><p>Vigna and Casey demystify cryptocurrency&#x2015;its origins, its function, and what you need to know to navigate a cyber-economy. The digital currency world will look very different from the paper currency world; <i>The Age of Cryptocurrency</i> will teach you how to be ready.</p></p><p><p>MICHAEL J.

In Fly the Plane, Mr. Putter, who still loves toys, realizes his dream of flight with the acquisition of a radio-controlled plane. Tabby is uncomfortable around this noisy new toy but hides her feelings when she sees how happy it makes him. Mr. Putter eventually decides to give his beloved possession to an eager child. Rylant tells her story with clear yet lyrical prose, but the tale itself is a slight one, burdened with too much sentiment and not enough humor. Row the Boat is much better and typical of the series's deft mix of gentle humor and old-fashioned sentiment. On a hot summer day, the two friends are wondering how to escape the sweltering heat. Mr. Putter decides to head for the pond and invites along their neighbors, Mrs. Teaberry and her dog, Zeke. They pack a picnic lunch, rent a rowboat, and end up having a wonderful time. When the walk home leaves them just as hot as before, Mrs. Teaberry knows just the trick to cool them down. This is vintage Mr. Putter and Tabby: simple escapades enlivened by the conviviality of their warm friendship.

When Leo Fender&#x2019;s tiny firm marketed the first solid-body electric guitar, the Esquire, musicians immediately saw its appeal. Not to be out-maneuvered, Gibson, the largest guitar manufacturer, raced to build a competitive product. The company designed an &#x201c;axe&#x201d; that would make Fender&#x2019;s Esquire look cheap and convinced Les Paul&#x2014;whose endorsement Leo Fender had sought&#x2014;to put his name on it. Thus was born the guitar world&#x2019;s most heated rivalry: Gibson versus Fender, Les versus Leo.<br> <br>While Fender was a quiet, half-blind, self-taught radio repairman, Paul was a brilliant but headstrong pop star and guitarist who spent years toying with new musical technologies. Their contest turned into an arms race as the most inventive musicians of the 1950s and 1960s&#x2014;including bluesman Muddy Waters, rocker Buddy Holly, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Eric Clapton&#x2014;adopted one maker&#x2019;s guitar or another. By 1969 it was clear that these new electric instruments had launched music into a radical new age, empowering artists with a vibrancy and volume never before attainable.<br> <br>In &#x201c;an excellent dual portrait&#x201d; (<i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal</i>), Ian S. Port tells the full story in <i>The Birth of Loud, </i>offering &#x201c;spot-on human characterizations, and erotic paeans to the bodies of guitars&#x201d; (<i>The Atlantic</i>). &#x201c;The story of these instruments is the story of America in the postwar era: loud, cocky, brash, aggressively new&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>).</p><p>Ian S. Port is an award-winning writer and music critic whose work has appeared in&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone</i>,&nbsp;<i>Village Voice</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Threepenny Review</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Believer</i>, among others. He is also the former music editor of the&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Weekly.</i>&nbsp;A lifelong guitar player and California native, he and his wife now live in New York City. <i>The Birth of Loud</i>&nbsp;is his first book.The Birth of Loud PROLOGUE<p></p> <br><br> <br>SANTA MONICA, 1964<br> <br>The screams came in waves, hysterical and elated, punctuated by applause. Then the camera found them: five men in matching striped shirts, teetering with nerves, grinning like children. The Beach Boys. A clap on the snare drum sent the song rumbling to life, and the players at the stage&#x2019;s front tapped their feet to stay in time. Punches from the drum kit underpinned a sheen of male voices in harmony. But fighting for prominence was another noise&#x2014;a throaty, splattering sonic current.<br> <br>Curious instruments hung over the striped shoulders of the men in front. Two of the instruments were painted white, with thin bodies and voluptuous curves that suggested spaceships, or amoebae, or the human torso. Behind their players sat cream-colored cabinets the size of refrigerators, massive speakers barely visible inside, components in a new system of noisemaking. These sleek guitars transformed single notes and chords into flows of electrons, while the amplifiers converted those electrons into wild new tones&#x2014;tones that came out piercingly human despite their electric hue.<br> <br>There was no piano, no saxophone or trumpet, no bandleader, no orchestra. Besides their drums and voices, the Beach Boys wielded just these bloblike guitars, each dependent on electricity, each able to produce ear-piercing quantities of sound, and nearly all bearing the name Fender. Their amplified blare seemed to encourage the shrieks of fans buffeting the stage, their bodies swaying to the thrumming joys of &#x201c;Surfin&#x2019; USA.&#x201d;<br> <br>When this scene played in American movie theaters just after Christmas 1964, it was a vision of the future. It was part of a filmed rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll concert&#x2014;the very first&#x2014;that also showed the Rolling Stones seething and strutting, and James Brown pulling off terpsichorean heroics unlike anything most of the American public had yet seen. The Teenage Awards Music International Show looked like one more entry in a procession of frivolous teen movies, but it arrived with the shock of the new. It was a multiracial assemblage of the day&#x2019;s most famous pop stars, captured on film alongside bikini-clad go-go dancers and howling youths. Movie critics mostly sniffed. &#x201c;Adults, unaware of the differences between these numerous young groups, view the combined efforts as fairly monotonous,&#x201d; went a typical assessment. But a new order was establishing itself.<br> <br>One of its precepts was racial equality, or at least the sincere pursuit of such. It was a celebration that both targeted and was beholden to the American teenager. And it prized music played on electric instruments that gave individual musicians a vast new sonic palette&#x2014;and volume level&#x2014;with which to express themselves.<br> <br>Only fifteen years earlier, this scene would have been unrecognizable. Popular music had been the domain of dedicated artisans, trained pros in tuxedos who read notes on paper and sat on bandstands in disciplined regiments, led by a big name in a bow tie. Crooners like Bing Crosby acted out songs written for them by others, and sang for adults, not young people. Nearly everyone who joined them on the pop charts had white skin.<br> <br>But in the boom years after World War II, teenagers had wrested control of the market for pop music, and many lacked their parents&#x2019; racial prejudice. Singers like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, and later Marvin Gaye and the Supremes, rose onto charts once ruled by whites. These cultural changes were accelerated by a complementary revolution in the technology of music-making. By the night The T.A.M.I. Show was filmed in 1964, anyone with the right equipment could achieve volumes that would reach hundreds or thousands of onlookers. The new rulers of music could manipulate electric guitars and amps to produce a universe of evocative or alien new sounds.<br> <br>One company had done more than any other to usher in the technology that was changing listeners&#x2019; aural experiences. One company had made electric guitars into ubiquitous leisure accessories, by supplying cheap, sturdy instruments to amateurs and professionals alike. This firm was the first in its industry to align itself with the tastes of young people, among the first to paint guitars bright red and later metal-flake blue and purple, first to give its models sexy monikers like the Stratocaster and the Jaguar.<br> <br>Competitors had long mocked the creations of the Fender Electric Instrument Company, but this Southern California upstart had an asset unlike any other&#x2014;a self-taught tinkerer whose modesty was utterly at odds with the brash characters who used his tools. Clad in perpetually drab workmen&#x2019;s clothes, preferring to spend most of his waking hours designing and building in his lab, Clarence Leo Fender toiled endlessly to perfect the tools that ushered in pop music&#x2019;s electric revolution, yet he couldn&#x2019;t play a single instrument himself. Instead, he trusted musicians, whom he loved, to tell him what they wanted. In the waning days of World War II, Leo Fender had started building guitars and amplifiers in the back of his radio repair shop. By that night in 1964, the company he&#x2019;d built dominated the burgeoning market for electric instruments.<br> <br>At least, for the moment.<br> <br>Showing off their striped, short-sleeve shirts, the Beach Boys appeared clean-cut and respectable, apparently (if not actually) innocent young men. To close out The T.A.M.I. Show, a quintet of Brits arrived wearing modish dark suits and expressions of bemused insouciance, even outright hostility. The lead singer&#x2019;s dark hair fell in curls down to his collar as he prowled the stage, thick lips pressed up against the microphone, hunting and taunting his young quarry. To his left, a craggy-faced guitarist beat on an unfamiliar instrument. That small, solid-bodied guitar responded with snarls and growls, a thick, surging sound that couldn&#x2019;t have been more different from the thin rays of light that had emanated from the Beach Boys&#x2019; Fenders.<br> <br>The earlier act embodied rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll life as a teen idyll, a carefree jaunt in which sex was mentioned only euphemistically, and hardly ever as a source of conflict. Minutes later, the Rolling Stones made rock into a carnal fantasy, a dim m�lange of ego and lust, betrayal and satisfaction. Already labeled rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll&#x2019;s bad boys, the five young Brits embraced the role in performance and offstage, viewing the Beach Boys&#x2014;another band of white men using electric guitars to play music first created by black men&#x2014;as entrants in a completely different competition.<br> <br>The Rolling Stones did sound new and distinct. And part of what then fueled the difference was an instrument discovered in a secondhand music shop in London, a secret weapon for producing the nasty tones this outfit preferred. It was a guitar, made by the venerable Gibson company, that bore the name Les Paul. Thanks to Keith Richards and certain other British rockers, this Les Paul guitar would soon rise again to become Fender instruments&#x2019; prime companion and rival&#x2014;just as the man it was named after had been many years earlier.<br> <br>For Les Paul himself was as emphatic and as colorful as human beings come, as loud and public as Leo Fender was quiet and private: a brilliant player and a gifted technician, a charmer and a comedian, a raconteur and a tireless worker who hungered for the top of the pop charts. Out of his roots in country and jazz, Les Paul had invented a flashy style of playing that was immediately recognizable as his own, a style that would help define the instrument for generations of ambitious guitarists. But almost since the moment he began playing, Les Paul had found existing guitars inadequate. He knew what he wanted and what he thought would make him a star: a loud, sustaining, purely electric guitar sound. Nothing would give it to him.<br> <br>His search for this pure tone&#x2014;and through it, fame&#x2014;led him to California, to a wary friendship with the self-taught tinkerer Leo Fender, who was interested in the same problem. The two men began experimenting together, pioneering the future of music. But when Les finally managed to drag the guitar out from its supporting role and deposit it at the center of American culture&#x2014;and when a radical new electric guitar design finally became reality&#x2014;their friendship fractured into rivalry. The greatest competitor to Leo Fender&#x2019;s instruments was soon a Gibson model with Les Paul&#x2019;s signature emblazoned in gold. From then on, it was Fender vs. Gibson, Leo Fender vs. Les Paul, their namesake electric guitars battling for the affections of a vast generation of players inspired by the new sound of rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll.<br> <br>For a brief period this competition seemed to abate. But soon after Keith Richards appeared in The T.A.M.I. Show using his Gibson Les Paul, his peers in the British rock scene would find that this instrument could produce tones then out of reach of any other guitar&#x2014;including a Fender. The Gibson Les Paul could become molten, searing, heavy: sounds for which it was never intended, but which were now wildly desirable. This guitar&#x2019;s look and sound would go on to virtually define a new style of blues-based hard rock.<br> <br>So almost from the moment the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones shared a stage in The T.A.M.I. Show, the old Fender-Gibson rivalry, that competition between the unassuming Leo Fender and the attention-seeking Les Paul, reignited. Once begun, this showdown&#x2014;between bright and dark, thin and thick, light and heavy, West and East, new and old&#x2014;would consume countless future musicians, as it still does to this day.<br> <br>But both men&#x2019;s instruments would also further a larger struggle. Whether in the hands of Chuck Berry or Buddy Holly, Jimi Hendrix or the Velvet Underground, Sly and the Family Stone or Led Zeppelin, Prince or the Runaways, Bad Brains or Sleater-Kinney, electric guitars would be used to make music with a tolerance&#x2014;stated, if imperfectly applied&#x2014;for people of different racial and ethnic identities. The music fueled by these instruments sought a single audience, or at least one ever-expanding group of listeners, who thought of themselves, however improbably, as young. And perhaps this bias toward diversity and youth explains some of the hostile words so casually published in 1964.<br> <br>For there were proper adults in the audience of the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on the night The T.A.M.I. Show was filmed. There were grown-ups sitting in the many movie theaters where it played. Were they really so bored by James Brown and the Rolling Stones, Marvin Gaye and the Beach Boys? Or did they perhaps sense that young people, armed with Leo Fender&#x2019;s and Les Paul&#x2019;s powerful new tools, might finally finish the cultural revolution they&#x2019;d long been threatening?</p><h2>The Collage Ideas Book</h2><p><br>Collage allows your creativity to run riot.

Thirteen-year-old Ellie has grown up in this violent, postpandemic world, and her disrespect for the military authority running her boarding school earns her new enemies, a new friend in fellow rebel Riley, and her first trip into the outside world. <br><br>* The official lead-in to the game from Faith Erin Hicks (<i>The Adventures of Superhero Girl</i>) and Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann!</p><p>World-weary Ellie hasn&#x2019;t known anything but the virus-ravaged, military-run region where she has spent the last few years shuttling between military boarding schools, and this new school isn&#x2019;t any different&#x2014;same thugs, same power-drunk administrators, same cruddy quarters. But when she spies spunky Riley sneaking out one night, she follows her into the outside world and meets the Fireflies, a vigilante group protecting citizens from heartless soldiers and hungry hordes of the infected (yes, zombies). Hicks (Nothing Can Possibly Go Wrong, 2013) is up to her usual tricks&#x2014;deeply expressive faces, cinematic action sequences, and detailed cityscapes&#x2014;and her cartoony artwork is satisfyingly unsettling against the dark, horror-tinged tale.

But now you don't need to trek to Brooklyn for "to-die-for" cheesecake because you can whip up these cakes right in your own kitchen with the help of <strong><em>Junior's Cheesecake Cookbook</em></strong>.</p> <p>Alan Rosen, the grandson of Junior's founder, reveals the very recipe that made Junior's reputation -- the Original New York Cheesecake, unchanged since 1950. But that's just the start. There's Banana Fudge, Lemon Coconut, Strawberry Parfait, Brownie Swirl cheesecake...well, you get the idea...50 fabulous reasons to indulge.</p> <p><strong>The must-have book for everyone who thinks a slice of cheesecake is a taste of heaven!</strong></p> <ul> <ul> <li>Cheesecake 101 -- a course-in-a-chapter. See how a little "babying" (a water bath, keeping cooling cakes out of drafts) goes a long way to ensuring crust and filling perfection. Includes a trouble-shooting chart, and wonderful garnish and flourish how-to's.</li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li>Junior's Favorites -- the "original," plain and wonderful, then mounded with fresh fruit, glistening with glaze, laden with crunch, swirled with chocolate, pumpkin, even peanut butter and jelly</li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li>"Reasons to Celebrate" -- Cherry Heart, Easter Egg, Christmas Tree, Stars &amp; Stripes...festive cheesecakes for every occasion</li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li>Did somebody say "chocolate?" Triple Chocolate, Chocolate Marble, Chocolate Crunch, Candy Bar Explosion...need we say more?</li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li>Little Fellas -- small in size, big in flavor, fast to make because they're mostly all filling. Freezable too. (Junior's tip: Double the recipe, and defrost to enjoy any time!)</li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li>Skyscrapers -- incredible cakes within cakes. Delicious homemade layer cakes (like devil's food) hold extra creamy layers of cheesecake.</li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <li>Terrific "inside" tips and mouthwatering full-color photos throughout</li> </ul></p><p>Alan Rosen, the grandson of Junior&#39;s founder, Harry Rosen, is the third generation co-owner (with his father and brother, Walter and Kevin Rosen) of Junior&#39;s restaurants in Brooklyn, Times Square, and Grand Central Station, and manager of its world-wide mail-order business and website, juniorscheesecake.com. Beth Allen is a recipe developer and cookbook author and co-authored &#34;Welcome to Junior&#39;s!&#34;Despite its popularity, cheesecake is one of the most intimidating desserts to make, due primarily to the ever-present threat of unsightly cracks appearing once the cake begins to cool. Here, Rosen and Allen dispel those fears by throwing open the kitchen doors to one of New York's cheesecake institutions. Cooks will learn to replicate Junior's previously secret recipe for classic New York-style cheesecake right down to the signature sponge cake crust and the knife to use "for professional slices." Once the basics are mastered, bakers can move on to Strawberry Swirl, Apple Caramel and Tiramisu variations, or take a crack at specialty shapes like an Easter egg or a cherry-topped heart. Though it's crucial to follow Rosen and Allen's instructions to the letter for a smooth, creamy and crack-free result, the final product is worth the effort, and the authors take great care to explain the hows and whys of each step in plain language (the three-pronged approach to avoid cracks? A water bath, low oven temperature and cornstarch in the cake batter). In addition, an in-depth troubleshooting guide addresses questions and concerns. This encouraging and educational book is pure gold for any aspiring cheesecake maker. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her finger hovered over the trigger button that was supposed to turn her plain little custards into crunchy, tasty treats. That&#x2019;s when she heard a car door slam outside.</p><p>She froze for a second, but then checked the clock. It was 5:16&#x2014;still a good forty-four minutes before her parents were due home from work, and they were never early. It&#x2019;s probably just the neighbors, she told herself, and turned back to her project.</p><p>Gladys knew her torch wasn&#x2019;t the right kind for making desserts&#x2014;it was a lot bigger than the one pictured in her cookbook, for starters, plus there was that huge DANGER: EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE label on its side. But she never abandoned a cooking experiment just because her parents didn&#x2019;t have the right kitchen equipment. Just last week she&#x2019;d rolled out pie dough with the stick of a broken umbrella, and it had turned out great.</p><p>Still, she thought as she repositioned the torch&#x2019;s nozzle, it would&#x2019;ve been nice if they&#x2019;d given me the minitorch I wanted for my eleventh birthday instead of that stupid tablet computer.</p><p>But they hadn&#x2019;t, so she was stuck with this old clunker from the garage. Oh well, she thought, and crossing her toes for luck inside her sneakers (her hands were kind of full), she took a deep breath and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Several things happened at once.</p><p>With a pop, a blue flame quite a few inches longer than she&#x2019;d expected shot out of the blowtorch, passing clear over the far edge of the first custard cup.</p><p>With a whoosh, the wintery wind outside changed direction and began to blow in through the kitchen window, setting the gauzy blue-and-white curtains aflutter.</p><p>And with a jingle and a grinding noise and finally a click, someone turned a key in the Gatsbys&#x2019; front door.</p><p>A moment later, she heard her parents&#x2019; footsteps in the hall.</p><p>&#x201c;Gladdy!&#x201d; her dad called. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got pizza!&#x201d;</p><p>Fudge! Gladys thought. She tried to release the trigger on the blowtorch, but to her horror, the spout kept shooting flame. She pumped it desperately with her finger, but that only seemed to make the flame bigger.</p><p>Their footsteps were getting louder.</p><p>Gripping the torch firmly, Gladys did her best to direct the now-enormous flame off the countertop and back over her cluster of custards. The tops turned brown from the heat almost immediately. She pumped the trigger again and, miraculously, this time heard a click as it released against her finger. The long blue flame started to retreat back into the torch&#x2019;s nozzle.</p><p>But then, at the exact moment her mom and dad stepped into the kitchen&#x2014;the exact moment that Gladys was about to spin around and explain that she had the situation perfectly under control&#x2014;the fluttering kitchen curtains crossed paths with the dying blowtorch flame and promptly caught on fire.</p><p>The flames couldn&#x2019;t have traveled up the blue-and-white fabric faster if it had been soaked in gasoline. Gladys staggered backward, and in an instant her whole secret cooking life flashed before her eyes.</p><p>She saw herself as a little kid, playing chef by mixing things in the giant ceramic bowl her parents had received as a housewarming present and never used.</p><p>She saw herself reading her first cookbook at the age of eight, and riding home from her first solo trip to Mr. Eng&#x2019;s Gourmet Grocery, her bike basket stuffed with ingredients for pasta primavera.</p><p>Nine. Ten. Eleven. She saw herself stewing tomatoes and steaming mussels, tossing spring salads and grilling steaks, rolling her own sushi and whipping her own whipped cream. She saw herself opening windows to air out the smell of her cooking and taking out trash bags full of eggshells and vegetable peels. She saw herself stashing leftovers in the rusty old fridge in the garage that no one else used anymore judging from the contents (two dented soda cans and a dried-up tube of superglue).</p><p>It was during one of those garage trips that she had first noticed the blowtorch, neglected in the corner . . .</p><p>The sound of the smoke alarm shocked Gladys back to the present. Her dad&#x2019;s briefcase clattered to the floor as he grabbed her arm and dragged her away from the window. Her mom&#x2019;s hair flew out of its bun as she ripped the fire extinguisher from the wall. White powder filled the air all around them as she sprayed the kitchen, and Gladys knew one thing for sure: Today would not be remembered as the day she proved what a great cook she was and earned more kitchen privileges. No, today would forever be the day Gladys Gatsby set the house on fire . . . and, if her family survived, the day she got into a great, big, fat amount of trouble.</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p><b>GLADYS GETS GRILLED</b></p><p>TEN MINUTES LATER, GLADYS SAT ON the living room sofa, staring down at her sneakers. They&#x2019;d been tomato red earlier, but were now more of a salmon color, thanks to the white extinguisher powder smudged across the canvas.</p><p>Gladys didn&#x2019;t normally get into trouble, so she didn&#x2019;t know a lot about punishments other than what she&#x2019;d read in books. Would she be grounded? Assigned to do backbreaking chores? Forced to live in a cupboard under the stairs?</p><p>She snuck a glance at her parents, who stood a few feet away, talking quietly. Her mom&#x2019;s stockings were ripped, and wisps of her dark brown hair stuck out at crazy angles. Her dad&#x2019;s glasses balanced awkwardly on his beaky nose, and a streak of soot darkened one arm of his dress shirt. Neither of them looked very happy.</p><p>Not wanting to catch their attention, Gladys quickly shifted her gaze to the Christmas tree in the corner. Its lights blinked on and off, illuminating the ornaments her aunt Lydia had sent her over the years. Her favorite one&#x2014;a hot pepper with her name engraved on it&#x2014;blazed to life, then fell back into darkness.</p><p>&#x201c;Gladdy?&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys jumped. Her stomach began to churn queasily, like it did after eating the greasy takeout her parents brought home most nights from Sticky Burger or Fred&#x2019;s Fried Fowl.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; she said as bravely as she could.</p><p>Her father knelt down beside the sofa. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s start at the beginning,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Can you explain to us what, exactly, you were doing in the kitchen?&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys told the truth. &#x201c;I was making cr�me br�l�e.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Crumb broo-lay?&#x201d; Gladys&#x2019;s dad looked up at his wife quizzically, but she just shrugged. &#x201c;What is crumb broo-lay?&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys sighed. If a dish wasn&#x2019;t on the menu at one of the fast-food joints in town, her parents didn&#x2019;t know it existed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a dessert,&#x201d; she explained. &#x201c;A custard with a crust of burnt sugar on top. Br�l�e means burnt in French.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So now we have curtains br�l�e, huh?&#x201d; Gladys&#x2019;s dad laughed at his little joke. But her mom didn&#x2019;t seem to think it was funny as she stepped forward to take over the interrogation. She had white extinguisher powder on her face, and her red lipstick was smeared. The combination made her look like a clown&#x2014;a scary clown.</p><p>&#x201c;Gladys,&#x201d; Clown-Mom said, moving her hands to her hips, &#x201c;who taught you how to make this crumb . . . thing?&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys took a deep breath. &#x201c;I taught myself,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen chefs do it on TV, and I found the recipe in one of my cookbooks, so&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you thought you&#x2019;d just drag your father&#x2019;s blowtorch out of the garage and take a crack at it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Gladys cried. &#x201c;I mean, I didn&#x2019;t just . . . decide to do it and go get the blowtorch. I planned it really carefully. Normally I&#x2019;m a very good cook.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Normally?&#x201d; Her mom raised one powder-dusted eyebrow.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>Gladys&#x2019;s dad jumped back in. &#x201c;Gladdy,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is this the first time you&#x2019;ve been cooking on your own?&#x201d;</p><p>The churning sensation in Gladys&#x2019;s stomach gave way to a sinking one as she shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;But why didn&#x2019;t you let us help?&#x201d; her dad said. &#x201c;We could have cooked this crumb thing together.&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys thought back to the few times she had tried to cook with her parents. It had always been a disaster.</p><p>If Gladys let her mom buy the supplies for a recipe, she would come home with the low-fat and sugar-free versions of every ingredient, insisting that they tasted the same as the regular ones.</p><p>They didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>But at least she looked at the recipe. Gladys&#x2019;s dad didn&#x2019;t believe in recipes, so if Gladys left him alone for even one minute, he&#x2019;d start throwing in random stuff, saying that experimenting always made a dish taste better.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Worst of all, even if they managed to cobble together a decent mixture of ingredients, Gladys&#x2019;s parents refused to use the oven or the stovetop&#x2014;not when they could just nuke things in the microwave.</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t bake cookies in a microwave!&#x201d; Gladys had cried during their last, most catastrophic family cooking project. &#x201c;It says right here: &#x2018;Bake for eight to ten minutes at 350 degrees in the oven&#x2019;!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it all works the same way,&#x201d; her mom had said as Gladys&#x2019;s dad scooped spoonfuls of dough directly onto the glass carousel.</p><p>Why did Gladys even bother? It wasn&#x2019;t like the cookies could have been saved at that point anyway. They were already full of light margarine instead of butter, zero-calorie sweetener instead of sugar, and four times as much baking soda as the recipe called for, which her dad said would make them &#x201c;extra light and fluffy.&#x201d;</p><p>So when the cookies had swelled to the size of grapefruits and exploded, Gladys wasn&#x2019;t surprised. But her parents were baffled.</p><p>&#x201c;See, this is why I hate to cook,&#x201d; her mom had complained as she scraped burnt dough off the inside of the microwave door. &#x201c;You put in all this effort, and it never comes out right!&#x201d;</p><p>That had been almost a year ago, and since then Gladys had only dared to cook while her parents were at work.</p><p>But now her father was looking at her curiously, waiting to find out why she never asked them for help. Gladys couldn&#x2019;t tell him to his face that they were terrible cooks&#x2014;not after what she&#x2019;d just done to the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you guys never really seem to . . . enjoy cooking,&#x201d; Gladys said carefully. &#x201c;So I thought that it would be better for everyone if I just did it on my own.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And burned down the house in the process?&#x201d; her mom snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;That was just an accident!&#x201d; Gladys knew her parents had a right to be upset, but she also felt like they were the ones who had forced her to do all the sneaking around in the first place. Now, like a forgotten pot heating on the back burner, her anger was boiling over. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve made 142 other recipes from twelve different cookbooks,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;and they all turned out fine!&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys could tell as it was coming out of her mouth that this was the wrong thing to say, but she couldn&#x2019;t stop herself. Now both of her parents were staring at her like she was an alien.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you say one hundred . . . and forty . . . two?&#x201d; her dad gasped.</p><p>An alien who cooked. A lot.</p><p>Gladys&#x2019;s dad&#x2019;s eyes were now as round as the measuring cups he never used, and her mom actually stood up and backed a step away from her, as if her cooking disease might be contagious.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2014;how did you do this?&#x201d; she stuttered. &#x201c;When did you do this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just messed around after school sometimes,&#x201d; Gladys said, trying too late to sound like it was no big deal. &#x201c;And during vacations, I guess.&#x201d; It was winter break now, and so far Gladys had taken advantage of every minute her parents spent at work. She&#x2019;d memorized their schedules, making sure to scour the kitchen and sneak her leftovers out to the garage fridge well before they got home each day. If only they hadn&#x2019;t chosen tonight to leave their offices early and surprise her.</p><p>Gladys&#x2019;s mom was pacing the room. &#x201c;You know, we&#x2019;ve tried to support your interests, Gladys,&#x201d; she said, her voice rising. &#x201c;We gave you cookbooks, which you promised were just for reading. We subscribed to that Planet Food channel, which you promised was just for watching. We&#x2019;ve even tried to organize family cooking projects from time to time . . . and this is how you repay us? By putting yourself in danger behind our backs?&#x201d;</p><p>She sank into the cushion next to Gladys on the sofa and placed a hand on her daughter&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that, well . . . we worry about you, honey,&#x201d; she said in a softer voice. &#x201c;When I was your age, I was on the swim team, and your dad played basketball, and we both had lots of friends. But you only seem to want to stay home and&#x201d;&#x2014;she glanced in the direction of the kitchen&#x2014;&#x201c;cook, I guess. What about making friends? What about having fun?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cooking is fun . . .&#x201d; Gladys started, but her dad shook his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Your mom&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and we&#x2019;re going to have to set some new rules around here. First of all, your allowance is suspended until the fire damage is all paid off.&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys nodded. That seemed fair.</p><p>&#x201c;And we think that it&#x2019;s time for you to explore some new hobbies. So, I&#x2019;m sorry, but the cooking is going to have to stop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;S-stop?&#x201d; Gladys wasn&#x2019;t sure what her father was saying.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; her mom agreed. &#x201c;No more cooking, no more cookbooks, and no more cooking TV shows for the next six months.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Six months?!&#x201d; Gladys couldn&#x2019;t believe it. That took her right up to the end of sixth grade. What was she supposed to do every day after school?</p><p>Her mom seemed to read her mind. &#x201c;So after Christmas,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;you can start doing some more . . . normal activities for a kid your age. You can hang out with other kids&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And play more computer games&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And . . . go to the mall!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why would I want to go to the mall?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gladdy, we&#x2019;re serious,&#x201d; her dad said, and the grim expression on his face meant that he was telling the truth.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, what am I supposed to eat?&#x201d; Gladys asked.</p><p>Her parents exchanged a confused look. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; her mom asked. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll eat what we always eat.&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys thought of the bland, floppy vegetables her parents brought home from Palace of Wong, the falling-apart sandwiches they got at Sticky Burger, and the goopy, undercooked crusts of the pizzas from Pathetti&#x2019;s Pies.</p><p>&#x201c;But the food we eat is gross,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It tastes awful and makes me feel sick. That&#x2019;s why I like to cook my own food.&#x201d;</p><p>The room was uncomfortably silent for a moment, then Gladys&#x2019;s dad cleared his throat. &#x201c;Well, maybe your mom and I will try to cook more often,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;You will?&#x201d; Gladys gasped.</p><p>&#x201c;We will?&#x201d; her mom gasped.</p><p>Gladys&#x2019;s dad turned to his wife. &#x201c;Look, if an eleven-year-old can do it, how hard can it be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really not that hard if you just follow a recipe!&#x201d; Gladys exclaimed. &#x201c;And if you let me teach you both some basic knife skills, we can&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whoa, whoa, whoa,&#x201d; her mom said. &#x201c;You will not be doing anything with knives. In fact, if any cooking happens&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m not saying it will&#x2014;then you&#x2019;ll have no part in it. Understood?&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys didn&#x2019;t want to agree, but she didn&#x2019;t seem to have any other options. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she mumbled. But, she added in her head, there&#x2019;s no way I&#x2019;m eating only your awful food for six whole months. Her parents might be able to ban her from the kitchen, but they couldn&#x2019;t stop her from cooking up some kind of survival plan.</p><p>&#x201c;Good, that&#x2019;s settled,&#x201d; her dad said, pushing himself up from the sofa....</p></p><h2>In the Tall, Tall Grass</h2><p><p>If you were a fuzzy caterpillar crawling through the tall, tall grass on a sunny afternoon, what would you see?</p><p>To find out, just follow the tiny tour guide as he inches his way through the pages of this book.

Shout It Out</i>!, and <i>Sleepy, Oh So Sleepy</i>. She won a Caldecott Honor for <i>In the Small, Small Pond</i>. Denise published her first painting in the third grade, when she started taking classes at the Toledo Museum of Art and one of her paintings was chosen to be the cover of a teacher's magazine. She now works primarily with paper, by pouring colored paper pulp through hand-cut stencils. She lives in Toledo, Ohio.</p>PreSchool-K-- Bold, bright, stylized collage illustrations capture the eye and the imagination as they depict the simple, rhyming text of this outstanding nature tale. From a caterpillar's point-of-view, children see the many happenings in the tall, tall grass: "crunch, munch, caterpillars lunch/dart, dip, hummingbirds sip" etc. Bees and birds, ants and snakes are among the daytime inhabitants. Then, with the "stars bright, moonlight" come nocturnal fireflies and bats: "good night, tall, tall grass." The childlike illustrations were created by pouring colored cotton pulp through hand-cut stencils, resulting in remarkable images. Colors--shaded and varied--range full spectrum, deep and true through sunny yellow, cobalt, plum, a dozen shades of green. On each double page appears the blue-eyed, yellow-with-orange-spots caterpillar, always in proper perspective to the other creatures. Two-year-olds (and even younger) will enjoy the rhyme and rhythm, three-year-olds exploring numbers will love counting insects, four-year-olds--who are sure they can "read"--will experience success after a few listenings, and adults won't mind the request, "Read it again, please."

He nearly made it.<br><br>Twenty-seven miles from Coolman&#x2019;s destination, an old green Firebird bashed his car from behind. The impact failed to trigger the Buick&#x2019;s airbags, but Coolman heard the rear bumper dragging. He steered off the highway and dialed 911. In the mirror he saw the Firebird, its grille crimped and steaming, pull onto the shoulder. Ahead stood a sign that read: &#x201c;Ramrod Key.&#x201d;<br><br>Coolman went to check on the other driver, a woman in her mid-thirties with red hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Super-duper sorry,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a nick. Barely bleeding.&#x201d; She held her phone in one hand and a disposable razor in the other.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you out of your mind?&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>The driver&#x2019;s jeans and panties were bunched around her knees. She&#x2019;d been shaving herself when she smashed Coolman&#x2019;s rental car.<br><br>&#x201c;I got a date,&#x201d; she explained.<br><br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t take care of that at home?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way! My husband would get so pissed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unreal,&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>The woman was wearing a maroon fleece jacket and rhinestone flip-flops. On her pale thigh was the razor mark.<br><br>&#x201c;How about a little privacy?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not quite done here.&#x201d;<br><br>Coolman walked back to the Buick and called the man he was supposed to meet in Key West. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be a few minutes late. You&#x2019;re not gonna believe what just happened,&#x201d; he said on the man&#x2019;s voicemail, leaving it at that.<br><br>The cops arrived and wrote up the red-haired pube shaver for careless driving. Naturally, she had no collision insurance; that would be Avis&#x2019;s problem, not Lane Coolman&#x2019;s. A tow truck hauled away the Firebird, which needed a new front end including a radiator. The woman approached Coolman and asked for a ride.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell your &#x2018;date&#x2019; to come get you,&#x201d; he said. One of the police officers had pried the damaged bumper from the Buick, and Coolman was trying to fit it into the backseat.<br><br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t have a car,&#x201d; said the woman, who&#x2019;d buttoned her jeans. She was attractive in a loose and scattered way. Coolman had a weakness for redheads.<br><br>&#x201c;See, I work for an escort service. We go to where the client&#x2019;s at,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I understand the concept.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s fleece was unzipped and beneath it she wore a black sequined top. Her toes must be freezing in those flip-flops, Coolman thought; the temperature was 55 degrees with a biting north wind, arctic conditions for the Florida Keys.<br><br>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Merry,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;spelled like Merry Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Bob,&#x201d; said Coolman, &#x201c;spelled like Bob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does that mean you&#x2019;ll give me a lift?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not,&#x201d; Coolman said, the worst mistake he would ever make.<br><br>At Mile Marker 22, Merry told him her last name was Mansfield, like the bombshell actress of the Fifties. Coolman stopped at a Circle K where he got a cup of coffee and Merry bought three eight-hour energy drinks, chugging the little purple bottles one after the other.<br><br>&#x201c;You running a marathon?&#x201d; Coolman asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all about performance.&#x201d;<br><br>At Mile Marker 17, she told him she didn&#x2019;t really work for an escort service.<br><br>&#x201c;Wild guess&#x2014;you&#x2019;re a dancer,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;On my own time,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Not one of those.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean it in a bad way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you just say stripper? The games you guys play, I swear.&#x201d; Her eyelashes were a paler shade of red than her hair.<br><br>Coolman said, &#x201c;Why would you make up a lie about being an escort?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Cause I needed a ride, Bob. If I said I was an artifacts appraiser you would&#x2019;ve left me standing in the road.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it you appraise?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sunken treasure. Doubloons and cannonballs and so forth. Business is slow right now. I&#x2019;m an expert on eighteenth-century Spanish maritime.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have a real date, or did you make up that part, too?&#x201d;<br><br>Merry laughed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s an Air Force pilot based at Boca Chica. Why else would I be doin&#x2019; my trim at sixty-five miles per hour?&#x201d;<br><br>At Mile Marker 8, she blurted, &#x201c;Did I say Air Force? I meant Navy.&#x201d; She was buzzing like a flagpole in a lightning storm. &#x201c;His name&#x2019;s Rocky.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about your husband?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a Rocky, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be judging me. I go for men with strong names.&#x201d;<br><br>The closer they got to Key West, the more Southern her accent became. Coolman was foolishly intrigued.<br><br>&#x201c;What about you?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your field, Bob? Your expertise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the entertainment business. I manage talent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your own, or somebody else&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ever seen the show Bayou Brethren?&#x201d; Coolman asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Little Rocky watches it all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your son? Little Rocky?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s what I call my husband. Don&#x2019;t make me spell out why.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anyway, I manage Buck. You know&#x2014;the family patriarch? Buck Nance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No shit?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Leader of the clan,&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, Bob, I know what a fucking patriarch is.&#x201d;<br><br>The show was taped in the Florida Panhandle at a swampy location that somewhat resembled a Louisiana bayou. Buck Nance and his brothers were actually from Wisconsin, but the network paid for a Cajun dialogue coach.<br><br>Merry said, &#x201c;So what brings you all the way down here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buck has a personal appearance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Parched Pirate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doing what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just being Buck.&#x201d;<br><br>Coolman hoped the guitar player had found the bar. Buck Nance had trouble speaking in public unless he was accompanied by a live musician. For his road gigs the writers at the network had come up with eight or nine amusing redneck stories, what you might call a monologue, and afterward Buck would take questions for ten minutes or so. The questions were printed on index cards distributed in advance to random fuckwits in the crowd.<br><br>Coolman offered to take Merry to the show. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll hang backstage,&#x201d; he added. Like there was a backstage.<br><br>&#x201c;What about my date?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Bail,&#x201d; Coolman said. &#x201c;Tell him the truth&#x2014;you had car trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But then I shaved down there for no reason.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not necessarily.&#x201d;<br><br>The redhead smiled and shook her head. &#x201c;For the Zac Brown Band I&#x2019;d ditch my Navy boy in a heartbeat, but not for some yahoo from the bayou.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only the top-rated cable program in the whole country.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I prefer the nature channels. You know&#x2014;penguins and cheetahs. Shit like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buck converted his Bentley to an ATV with rifle racks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why would a grown man do something so ridiculous?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;America worships the guy. You should come hear him tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Another time,&#x201d; said Merry.<br><br>At Mile Marker 5, she made a call on her cell phone. All she said was, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t wet yourself, sugar. I&#x2019;m almost there.&#x201d;<br><br>At Mile Marker 4, after they&#x2019;d crossed the bridge into Key West, she flipped open the visor mirror and checked her makeup. Freshened her lipstick.

He lives in Brooklyn.&nbsp;Now Entering Fantasyland<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> This book has been germinating for a long time. In the late 1990s I wrote a few articles pointing toward it&#x2014;about American politics morphing into show business and baby boomers trying to stay forever young, about un- true conspiracy theories being mainstreamed and the explosion of talk radio as it became more and more about the hosts&#x2019; wild opinions. In 1999 I published a novel about a TV producer who created two groundbreaking shows&#x2014; a police drama in which the fictional characters interact with real police arresting real criminals, and a news program featuring scenes of the anchors&#x2019; private lives.<br><br> But the ideas and arguments really started crystallizing in 2004 and 2005. First President George W. Bush&#x2019;s political mastermind Karl Rove introduced the remarkable phrase <i>reality-based community</i>. People &#x201c;in the reality- based community,&#x201d; he told a reporter, &#x201c;believe that solutions emerge from judicious study of discernible reality. That&#x2019;s not the way the world really works anymore.&#x201d; He said it with a sense of humor, but he was also deadly serious. A year later <i>The Colbert Report </i>went on the air. In the first few minutes of his&nbsp;first episode, Stephen Colbert, playing his right-wing populist character, per- formed a feature called The Word in which he riffed on a phrase. <i>&#x201c;Truthiness,&#x201d; </i>he said. <br>&nbsp;<br> Now I&#x2019;m sure some of the &#x201c;word police,&#x201d; the &#x201c;wordinistas&#x201d; over at Webster&#x2019;s, are gonna say, &#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s not a word!&#x201d; Well, anybody who knows me knows that I&#x2019;m no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They&#x2019;re elitist. Constantly telling us what <i>is </i>or <i>isn&#x2019;t </i>true. Or what <i>did </i>or <i>didn&#x2019;t </i>happen. Who&#x2019;s <i>Britannica </i>to tell me the Panama Canal was finished in 1914? If I wanna say it happened in 1941, that&#x2019;s my right. I don&#x2019;t trust books&#x2014;they&#x2019;re all fact, no heart. . . . Face it, folks, we are a divided nation . . . divided between those who think with their head and those who <i>know </i>with their heart. . . . Because that&#x2019;s where the truth comes from, ladies and gentlemen&#x2014;the gut.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Whoa, yes, </i>I thought: <i>exactly. </i>America had changed in this particular, peculiar way, I realized. Until the 2000s, <i>truthiness </i>and <i>reality-based community </i>wouldn&#x2019;t have made much sense as jokes.<br><br> My understanding of how this change occurred became clearer a few years later, when I started work on a novel about a group of kids who in the early 1960s role-play James Bond stories, and then in 1968, as college students, undertake a real-life Bond-like antigovernment plot. During the 1960s, reality and fantasy blurred problematically, for my characters and for plenty of real Americans. In the course of researching and thinking through that story, I came to understand the era and its impacts in a new way. For all the fun, and all the various positive effects of the social and cultural upheavals, I saw that it was also the Big Bang moment for truthiness. And if the 1960s amounted to a national nervous breakdown, we are mistaken to consider ourselves over it, because what people say about recovery is true: you&#x2019;re never really <i>cured</i>.<br><br> I realized too that this complicated American phenomenon I was trying to figure out had been not just decades but centuries in the making. In order to understand our weakness for fantasy of all kinds, I needed to follow the tendrils and branches and roots further back&#x2014;all the way back, to America&#x2019;s beginnings.<br><br> You&#x2019;re not going to agree with me about all the various mental habits and beliefs and behaviors I classify here as imaginary or fantastical. You may find me too judgmental about matters of deep personal conviction. As I pass by fish in barrels, I will often shoot them. But I don&#x2019;t consider all religion or all&nbsp;alternative belief systems or all conspiracy theories or all impossible dreams misguided. Each of us is on a spectrum somewhere between the poles of rational and irrational. We all have hunches we can&#x2019;t prove and superstitions that make no sense. <br><br>What&#x2019;s problematic is going overboard, letting the subjective entirely override the objective, people thinking and acting as if opinions and feelings were just as true as facts. The American experiment, the original embodiment of the great Enlightenment idea of intellectual freedom, every individual free to believe anything she wishes, has metastasized out of control. From the start, our ultra-individualism was attached to epic dreams, sometimes epic fantasies&#x2014;every American one of God&#x2019;s chosen people building a custom-made utopia, each of us free to reinvent himself by imagination and will. In America those more exciting parts of the Enlightenment idea have swamped the sober, rational, empirical parts.<br><br> Little by little for centuries, then more and more and faster and faster during the last half-century, Americans have given ourselves over to all kinds of magical thinking, anything-goes relativism, and belief in fanciful explanation, small and large fantasies that console or thrill or terrify us. And most of us haven&#x2019;t realized how far-reaching our strange new normal has become. The clich� would be the frog in the gradually warming pot, oblivious to its doom until too late.*<br> Much more than the other billion or two people in the rich world, we Americans believe&#x2014;<i>really believe</i>&#x2014;in the supernatural and miraculous, in Satan on Earth now, reports of recent trips to and from Heaven, and a several- thousand-year-old story of life&#x2019;s instantaneous creation several thousand years ago.<br><br> At the turn of the millennium, our financial industry fantasized that risky debt was no longer risky, so many tens of millions of Americans fantasized that they could live like rich people, given our fantasy that real estate would always and only increase in value.<br><br> We believe the government and its co-conspirators are hiding all sorts of monstrous truths from us&#x2014;concerning assassinations, extraterrestrials, the genesis of AIDS, the 9/11 attacks, the dangers of vaccines, and so much more.<br><br> We stockpile guns because we fantasize about our pioneer past, or in anticipation of imaginary shootouts with thugs and terrorists. We acquire military costumes and props in order to pretend we&#x2019;re soldiers&#x2014;or elves or zombies&#x2014;fighting battles in which nobody dies, and enter fabulously realistic virtual worlds to do the same.<br><br> And that was all before we became familiar with the terms <i>post-factual </i>and <i>post-truth, </i>before we elected a president with an astoundingly open mind about conspiracy theories, what&#x2019;s true and what&#x2019;s false, the nature of reality.<br><br> We have passed through the looking glass and down the rabbit hole.<br> America has mutated into Fantasyland.<br><br>How widespread is this promiscuous devotion to the untrue? How many Americans now inhabit alternate realities? Any given survey of people&#x2019;s beliefs is only a sketch of what people in general really think, but from reams of research, drilling down and cross-checking and distilling data from the last twenty years, a rough, useful census of American belief, credulity, and delusion does emerge.<br><br> By my reckoning, the more or less solidly reality-based are a minority, maybe a third of us but almost certainly fewer than half. Only a third of us, for instance, believe with some certainty that CO2&nbsp;emissions from cars and factories are the main cause of Earth&#x2019;s warming. Only a third are sure the tale of creation in Genesis isn&#x2019;t a literal, factual account. Only a third strongly disbelieve in telepathy and ghosts.<br><br> Two-thirds of Americans believe that &#x201c;angels and demons are active in the world.&#x201d; At least half are <i>absolutely certain </i>Heaven exists, ruled over by a personal God&#x2014;not some vague force or universal spirit but a <i>guy</i>. More than a third of us believe not only that global warming is no big deal but that it&#x2019;s a hoax perpetrated by a conspiracy of scientists, government, and journalists.<br> A third believe that our earliest ancestors were humans just like humans today; that the government has, in league with the pharmaceutical industry, hidden evidence of &#x201c;natural&#x201d; cancer cures; that extraterrestrials have recently visited (or now reside on) Earth.<br><br> A quarter believe vaccines cause autism and that Donald Trump won the popular vote in the 2016 general election. A quarter believe that our previous president was (or is?) the Antichrist. A quarter believe in witches. Remark- ably, no more than one in five Americans believe the Bible consists mainly of legends and fables&#x2014;around the same number who believe that &#x201c;the media or&nbsp;the government adds secret mind-controlling technology to television broad- cast signals&#x201d; and that U.S. officials were complicit in the 9/11 attacks.<br><br>When I say that a third believe X or a quarter believe Y, it&#x2019;s important to understand that those are <i>different </i>thirds and quarters of the U.S. population. Various fantasy constituencies overlap and feed each other&#x2014;for instance, belief in extraterrestrial visitation and abduction can lead to belief in vast government cover-ups, which can lead to belief in still more wide-ranging plots and cabals, which can jibe with a belief in an impending Armageddon involving Jesus. Fantasyland operates like the European Union, a collection of disparate domains of various sizes overlaid with a Schengen Area that al- lows citizens of any of the dozens of lands to travel freely among the others, the way Hungarians and Maltese can visit France or Iceland at will.<br><br> And like intra-European antipathies, the mutual contempt among Fantasyland regions can be as intense as their contempt for the reality-based. To many evangelicals, Pentecostals are heretics, and to evangelicals and Pentecostals, Mormons are heretics; Pat Robertson has called Scientology satanic; the Vatican considers Oprah&#x2019;s apostles misguided fools; different kinds of truthers regard each other as deluded. A lot of the people certain that GMOs are unsafe to eat, despite overwhelming scientific consensus to the contrary, deride deniers of climate science. Indeed, the history of Fantasyland could be rendered bracketologically, like college basketball, centuries of continuous playoffs, with particular teams losing (Puritans) and winning (Mormons) along the way and continuing to fight it out today.<br><br> Why are we like this?<br><br> That&#x2019;s what this book will explore. The short answer is <i>because we&#x2019;re Americans, </i>because being American means we can believe any damn thing we want, that our beliefs are equal or superior to anyone else&#x2019;s, experts be damned. Once people commit to that approach, the world turns inside out, and no cause-and-effect connection is fixed. The credible becomes incredible and the incredible credible.<br><br> The word <i>mainstream </i>has recently become a pejorative, shorthand for bias, lies, oppression by the elites. Yet that hated Establishment, the institutions and forces that once kept us from overdoing the flagrantly untrue or absurd&#x2014;media, academia, politics, government, corporate America, professional associations, respectable opinion in the aggregate&#x2014;has enabled and encouraged every species of fantasy over the last few decades.<br><br> A senior physician at one of America&#x2019;s most prestigious university hospitals promotes miracle cures on his daily TV show. Major cable channels air documentaries treating mermaids, monsters, ghosts, and angels as real. A CNN anchor speculated on the air that the disappearance of a Malaysian airliner was a supernatural event. State legislatures and one of our two big political parties pass resolutions to resist the imaginary impositions of a New World Order and Islamic law. When a political scientist attacks the idea that &#x201c;there is some &#x2018;public&#x2019; that shares a notion of reality, a concept of reason, and a set of criteria by which claims to reason and rationality are judged,&#x201d; col- leagues just nod and grant tenure. A white woman <i>felt </i>black, pretended to be, and under those fantasy auspices became an NAACP official&#x2014;and then, busted, said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a costume . . . not something that I can put on and take off anymore. I wouldn&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m African American, but I <i>would </i>say I&#x2019;m black.&#x201d; Bill Gates&#x2019;s foundation has funded an institute devoted to creationist pseudo- science. Despite his nonstop lies and obvious fantasies&#x2014;rather, <i>because </i>of them&#x2014;Donald Trump was elected president. The old fringes have been folded into the new center. The irrational has become respectable and often unstoppable. As particular fantasies get traction and become contagious, other fantasists are encouraged by a cascade of out-of-control tolerance. It&#x2019;s a kind of twisted Golden Rule unconsciously followed: <i>If those people believe </i>that<i>, then certainly </i>we <i>can believe </i>this.<br><br> Our whole social environment and each of its overlapping parts&#x2014; cultural, religious, political, intellectual, psychological&#x2014;have become conducive to spectacular fallacy and make-believe. There are many slippery slopes, leading in various directions to other exciting nonsense. During the last several decades, those naturally slippery slopes have been turned into a colossal and permanent complex of interconnected, crisscrossing bobsled tracks with no easy exit. <i>Voil�: </i>Fantasyland.<br><br> The scope of this book extends way beyond the contagion of clear-cut, fact- checkable untruths. America&#x2019;s transformation finally clicked into focus for me when I stepped back and broadened my field of vision. I saw that the proliferation of delusions and illusions concerning the large subjects that people have always debated&#x2014;politics, religion, even science&#x2014;is connected to the proliferation and glut of the fictional and quasi-fictional coursing through everyday American life. <br><br>What I&#x2019;m calling Fantasyland isn&#x2019;t only a matter of falsehoods fervently believed but of people assembling make-believe <i>lifestyles </i>as well. Both kinds of fantasy&#x2014;conspiracy theories and belief in magic on one hand and fantasy football and virtual reality on the other&#x2014;make everyday existence more ex- citing and dramatic. And the modern tipping points for both kinds were the result of the same two momentous changes.<br><br> The first was that profound shift in thinking that swelled up in the 1960s, whereby Americans ever since have had a new rule set in their mental operating systems, even if they&#x2019;re certain <i>they </i>possess the <i>real </i>truth: <i>Do your own thing, find your own reality, it&#x2019;s all relative. </i>The paradigm can be explicit or implicit, conscious or unconscious, but it&#x2019;s the way we are now.<br><br> The second big enabling change was the new era of information and communications. Digital technology empowers real-seeming fictions of both types, the lifestyle and entertainment kinds as well as the ideological and religious and pseudoscientific kinds, in subtypes bright and dark. Among the one billion websites, believers in anything and everything can find thousands of fellow fantasists who share their beliefs, with collages of facts and &#x201c;facts&#x201d; to back them up. Before the Internet, crackpots were mostly isolated and surely had a harder time remaining convinced of their alternate realities. Now their devoutly believed opinions are all over the airwaves and the Web, just like actual news.

German, Scandinavian, Polish, French, and Italian immigrant families baked their way to the American Midwest, instilling in it pies, breads, cookies, and pastries that manage to feel distinctly home-grown.<br> After more than a decade of living in California, author Shauna Sever rediscovered the storied, simple pleasures of home baking in her Midwestern kitchen.

It's filled to the brim with all the simple, sentimental kinds of baked goods that are so much a part of the heartbeat of the midwest.

It will be covered with flour and smears of butter in no time!"&#x2015;<b><i>Ree Drummond, best selling author of <i>The Pioneer Woman Cooks</i></i></b><br><br>Don't even open this book unless you're prepared to rush to the kitchen to bake-it's that inspiring. With Sever's new book, we enter a world where home baking is treasured, where recipes are passed down through generations, where bakers, new and seasoned, revel in the bounty of the region, and where there's always something sweet on the kitchen counter. <i>Midwest Made</i> is as warm, generous, and inviting as an Ozark Skillet Cake.&#x2015;<b><i>Dorie Greenspan, award-winning author of <i>Everyday Dorie </i>and <i>Dorie's Cookies</i></i></b><br><br>"Shauna Sever's deep look at the Midwest through its carbs in <i>Midwest Made</i> took me by actual surprise. Maybe it's that you can feel her connection to this place through stories about kranskakes, kuchens, runzas, and the people who bake them, or maybe it's because it feels like she's right there with you when you read her prose. Whatever the magic is, Shauna and her Midwestern glitter has made me want to BAKE!"&#x2015;<b><i>Vivian Howard, award-winning host of PBS's <i>A Chef's Life</i> and author of <i>Deep Run Roots</i></i></b><br><br>"The baking traditions of the Midwest are as deep as anywhere I know of.

Christmas is coming, and Olivia is incredibly busy. She has to wait for Santa, make sure dad sets up the tree, wait for Santa, watch mom make the Christmas dinner, wait for Santa, oversee the care with which the stockings are hung and, of course, OPEN HER PRESENTS! Do you see how hard it is to be so helpful during the holidays! A lovingly-told and lavishly-illustrated Olivia Helps With Christmas is the perfect stuffing for any stocking, and the newest star atop the <i>Olivia</i> series. <br> <br> <b>Amazon.com Exclusive</b><br><b>Olivia's Family Traditions</b><br>It did not matter how much discussion there was to be had with his editors during the process of creating <i>Olivia Helps with Christmas</i>, there was one thing that Ian Falconer was absolutely certain about... Santa Claus would appear NOWHERE in the book. Olivia and her brothers and sisters would do everything they could to get ready for Santa, and they sure would be anticipating Santa's arrival, but readers would not see the fabled Kriss Kringle. With all the ideas that were put on the table for this book, that was one Falconer would not stray from. <p> And with good reason. </p><p> This was to be a different type of Christmas book. A book about how a family celebrates Christmas, and how a lot of family holiday traditions really revolve around preparations. In fact, the reason the book has such a personal feel to it is because many of the traditions that Olivia and her family celebrate were taken straight from Ian's childhood memories: Being asked to set the Christmas table was a big honor for Ian (as it is for Olivia in the book). The caroling by the piano, the "Santa watch," the order in which things were done (tree up Christmas Eve, dinner, caroling, hanging stockings), even the phrase "warming your trotters by the fire"--all of it has roots in the Falconer home. And since Ian never did catch a glimpse of Santa at Christmas, neither could Olivia. It's for the best, really. Olivia likes to be the true star of her books--Santa would have met his match. </p><p> For your viewing pleasure: A bonus illustration of Olivia not available in <i>Olivia Helps with Christmas</i>! <br> <br></p>Ian Falconer is the author and illustrator of the Olivia book series, including <i>Olivia</i>, <i>Olivia Helps with Christmas</i>, <i>Olivia and the Fairy Princesses</i>, <i>Olivia and the Missing Toy</i>, <i>Olivia Saves the Circus</i>, to name a few.

Do you find yourself working harder and harder to tame the chaos? Mark DeVries and Annette Safstrom know how you feel. Flash and fizz can be effective at attracting young families, but without sustainable systems beneath the unforgettable moments, the impact is almost always short-lived. In this practical resource, you&#x2019;ll learn how to recruit volunteers, partner with parents, navigate politics, and care for your own soul instead of frantically scrambling to do it all yourself. <em>Sustainable Children&#x2019;s Ministry</em> will help you build a ministry foundation that will still be standing long after you are gone.</p><p>"Ministry is hard work. I appreciate the honesty of Annette's story and experience. She practically breaks down how to help you develop systems. Whether you're beginning in ministry or on the brink of quitting, this book is a great reminder that it's not about doing ministry alone, but about you and your church thriving as you develop the foundational structure for a fruitful and lasting ministry." (Yancy, songwriter and worship leader for kids and families, Yancy Ministries, Inc.)<br><br>"If you are looking for a book to help you be incredibly strategic with life-changing results in children's ministry, then this book is for you.

Easy-to-implement remedies are available on every page of their new book <em>Sustainable Children's Ministry</em>. After decades of ministry, I cannot agree more that 'Putting functional systems in place will never be urgent, but without them, everything becomes urgent.' This book just may transform your children's ministry and also restore a sense of joy and purpose to your whole church as together you train up a child." (Kendy Easley, executive pastor, Bethany Community Church, Seattle)<br><br>"There's hope for every tired and frustrated children's ministry worker out there, and you'll find it in this book. It's a step-by-step guide to building a healthy, effective, and collaborative children's ministry, and how to actually enjoy your ministry job again. Don't walk&#x2015;run to read this book!" (Mary Beth Abplanalp, youth minister)<br><br>"This is the book I wish I had had twenty years ago when I first started in children&#x2019;s ministry. I knew I wanted to do things differently but was not quite sure how. This is also the book I need to remind me to tend to the systems and not to get bogged down putting out fires. This is a resource that I will not only recommend to those in children's ministry, but will also use myself since so much of it transfers across ministry areas. The work of the church should continue well beyond any one person or leader, and <em>Sustainable Children&#x2019;s Ministry</em> helps the people of God, whether paid or not, to live and serve in the ways God has gifted and called them." (Holly Dittrich, executive pastor, First United Methodist Church, Hurst, TX)<br><br>"If you need wise friends to walk you through developing a meaningful children&#x2019;s ministry built around systems that make sense and minimize chaos, take the time to read this book. Full of good advice, real-life examples, and strategies for remaining joyful while serving the church, Annette&#x2019;s and Mark&#x2019;s words are manna for people who want to do this work well for a long time." (Elizabeth Cole Goodrich, associate pastor for discipleship, Independent Presbyterian Church, Birmingham, AL)<br><br>"It has been many years since I received that frantic call from my pastor saying that the previous children's pastor just resigned and he thought I'd be perfect for the job. I suspect that many children's pastors backed their way into ministry in much the same way that I did. I've learned a lot in the intervening years of ministry. And some of that learning came from the work of Mark DeVries, who came to my aid many times over the years with his innovative writing in the area of youth and family ministry. Now, with the partnership of an experienced children's pastor, Annette Safstrom, Mark has finally moved into my neighborhood of children's ministry. In a practical and easy-to-read way, this book will introduce you to key systems for ministry, providing a solid foundation for your ministry to thrive. As I read this systematic and well-organized book, I wished that I'd had such an easy-to-follow plan all those years ago. It would have saved my sanity over and over again!" (Trevecca Okholm, adjunct professor of practical theology, Azusa Pacific University; author, Kingdom Family: Re-Envisioning God's Plan for Marriage and Family)<br><br>"Children's ministries need this book! It is packed full of practical and proven training that will help you get out of the weekly whirlwind and focus on what matters most. A must-read for anyone ministering to children and families." (Zach Coffin, director of next generation discipleship for the Wesleyan Church)<br><br>"This book is a game-changer for the world of children's ministry. It accurately identifies the pitfalls and the challenges that most ministry leaders encounter and responds with practical, systematic methods to implement. I highly recommend this book to anyone in children's ministry as a roadmap to create a thriving, healthy ministry environment that brings out the best in your leadership." (Gina McClain, global children's pastor, Faith Promise Church, Knoxville, TN)<br><br>"People who like cooking love the idea of a box that contains pre-portioned food and cooking instructions. <em>Sustainable Children's Ministry</em> is a box with ingredients that offer what it takes to construct and maintain a healthy, well-balanced ministry to kids and family. It comes with a manual written by two people, Annette Safstrom and Mark DeVries, who know the frontlines well and have sat and dreamed with hundreds of churches seeking to create an enduring ministry for children. This is the box you get to keep, and it gives you what you need to build a strong ministry and go forward." (Doug Ranck, associate pastor of youth, children, and families, Free Methodist Church, Santa Barbara, CA)<br><br>"In a ministry culture where gimmicks and entertainment can overshadow the reason we serve, it is refreshing to read a book that keeps the essentials and the eternal front and center. Whether you are new to ministry or a seasoned pro, broken and burned out, or out of touch with what matters most, <em>Sustainable Children&#x2019;s Ministry</em> is for you. Proven, practical steps mixed with just enough real-life ministry examples provide the reader with a resource to build a ministry from scratch, evaluate an existing ministry, or tweak a program to make it strong until the end. I look forward to sharing this book with my entire leadership team." (Danielle Bell, minister to children, Dawson Family of Faith, Birmingham)<br><br>"As a children's pastor, this is a must read. <em>Sustainable Children's Ministry</em> will be my go-to guide for many years to come because I have seen the elements of this book transform our church's ministry to children and families in just a few years. DeVries and Safstrom speak to the specific struggles of children's ministry and show how to practically lead from a place of chaos into order." (Casey Cramer, pastor of children, youth, and families, Christ Presbyterian Church, Nashville)<br><br>"Leading has always mattered when it comes to ministry, and with today&#x2019;s multifaceted pace, strategy matters as well. <em>Sustainable Children&#x2019;s Ministry</em> offers a soup-to-nuts approach for building a sure foundation upon which children, volunteers, parents, and those in charge can be cultivated. Annette and Mark assist us by providing focused and caring ministry to our youngest in faith. We were never meant to do this alone and, in fact, we are robbing others of the joy of ministry when we don&#x2019;t ask for help or don&#x2019;t have a focused strategy. This how-to book breaks down the seemingly overwhelming chunks necessary for a mission-based ministry and changes have-tos into bite-sized get-tos. Lots of examples will springboard the imagination. I look forward to watching this book lead to continued evolution in congregational children&#x2019;s ministry in the months and years to come." (Kris Bjorke, cofounder and director of InterServe Ministries)<br><br>"<em>Sustainable Children&#x2019;s Ministry</em> gave me a great boost of energy for my work during a time when I greatly needed it. I found myself laughing out loud when I recognized myself in many of the author&#x2019;s own stories including grand mistakes, laments of isolation, and being stymied by the disease of chronic volunteer deficiency (CVD). But I also found hope in the very practical approach of encouraging me to be intentional about goals for Christian formation, building systems, using tools, partnering with parents, and clarifying roles. I also appreciated the practice of regularly identifying how God is at work in our ministries with children and relying on God&#x2019;s creativity to sustain us in all that we do." (Laura H.

As you are led to your table, waiters pass by carrying trays loaded with large platters of hot antipasti, crisp Caesar salad, garlic bread oozing butter, pasta with white clam sauce, steak Contadina, and eggplant Parmesan. Dizzy with anticipation for the meal ahead, you suddenly are distracted by the sight of a gigantic ice cream dessert--aptly named, you later discover, the Titanic--on its way to a happy group at a nearby table. Everywhere you look, customers look well fed, happy, and relaxed. This is going to be some meal! Laughter fills the air, bubbling into the room and dancing off the walls as it mingles with cheerful conversation and the gloriously inviting scents emanating from the constantly swinging kitchen doors. The tables are spacious, the lighting muted, the wood paneling dark, and the warm-toned beige walls are filled with black-and-white photographs of Italian families and well-known Italian Americans. Everything is designed to evoke the past and the great culinary heritage Italian immigrants brought to our shores, but nothing is actually old or outmoded. This is the Carmine's experience. It's this experience that you can bring home to your family when you prepare the recipes on the following pages. Our food is a synthesis of what Italians, many from Southern Italy, broughtwith them to New York when they passed through Ellis Island on their way to a better life. It is food rich with tomato sauces, fresh herbs, garlic, olive oil, seafood, pasta, sausages, cheese, and lots of love. It's Italian! OUR STYLE OF ITALIAN FOOD Let's face it. When most Americans think about Italian food, it is dishes such as ours--stuffed mushrooms; pasta with broccoli, sausage, and tomatoes; shrimp scampi; and veal Marsala--that spark the taste buds. Everyone loves spicy meatballs and a good marinara sauce, and everyone loves bubbling hot lasagna--and it's been decades since these foods have been considered "foreign." On the contrary, they are all-American family favorites. Perhaps this is no surprise. Italians began emigrating to the United States during the second half of the nineteenth century, with a concentration arrivingafter 1880. In the beginning, most were single men from Southern Italy, where overcrowding and poverty chased them from home, and most planned to return to Italy once they made some money. In fact, the Italians were dubbed "birds of passage" because they were considered migratory workers who traveled back and forth from one continent to the other. This also explains why so few went into farming, preferring the relatively high wages and numerous but transitory jobs in the cities--although they painstakingly cultivated small urban gardens. Because of the structure and importance of Italian family life, when wives and children finally emigrated, the women tended to stay home or to work in small family businesses rather than sign on as domestic or factory workers. This meant that they were around to cook simple, thrifty meals that reminded everyone in the household of home. What were these meals? Pasta was easy to make with flour and eggs and cost very little. Tomatoes grew well during American summers and were ideal for canning. Cow's milk was plentiful and could be made into simple fresh cheeses such as mozzarella and ricotta. Pork was not too costly, and the fattier cuts could be cured into salami. Most Americans in those days didn't grow garlic, bell peppers, or zucchini, but that didn't stop the Italians from planting their gardens with these and other vegetables. Nor did they refrain from making wine and grappa in city basements. When these Italian home cooks prepared meals, economy was always an issue. They braised inexpensive cuts of meat long and slow to tenderize them with tantalizingly delicious results. If they ran out of meat or cheese, resourceful cooks used bread crumbs to add texture to pasta. They stuffed garden-grown peppers with mixtures bolstered with bread cubes, garlic and herbs, and thrifty amounts of meat or chicken. They filled sheets of pasta with creative combinations of vegetables and cheese for ravioli. From these humble beginnings great traditions were born in the kitchens of Lower Manhattan, Boston's North End, and South Philly. Sunday afternoonswere family days when everyone, from the oldest great-grandmother to the youngest baby, got together to eat and drink, tell stories of the old country, and admire the growing families flourishing in America. Women began cooking their red sauce long before church on Sunday morning, and as soon as they got home from Mass they made the pasta, which they cut into various shapes as they gossiped around the kitchen table. The men sliced off hunks of salami and hard cheese to sustain them until the late-afternoon meal was served, and the kids raced up and down the front stoops, calling to their cousins as they played street games. This is the experience we strive to re-create at Carmine's. Every day is Sunday afternoon for us, and everyone is always welcome. The food is fresh, hot, and redolent of garlic, basil, and olive oil. We pile platters with fresh salads, steaming, just-cooked pasta bathed in heady red sauce, perfectly seasoned chicken and steak, and glorious vegetables. All of our dishes are served family-style, and all of our dishes are made to order. You might swear there's a little old Italian grandmother in the kitchen stirring pots and adding a pinch of this, a sprinkling of that to make your meal so perfect! The dishes in this book are wonderful for everyday family meals or for large parties. We can't think of a better way to set a buffet table for a casual family get-together or a more formal dinner party than with platters of Cold Roasted Figs with Gorgonzola, Prosciutto Bits, Grapes, and Balsamic Glaze, our famous Chicken Wings Scarpariello-Style with Gorgonzola Dipping Sauce, perfectly cooked Porterhouse Steak Contadina, and Slow-Roasted Lamb Shoulder Chops with Vegetable Orzo Risotto, followed by Carmine's Tiramisu. Now that's a party! So, with a smile on your face, a smear of tomato sauce on your apron, and <i>Carmine's Family-Style Cookbook</i> in your kitchen, you and your loved ones can sit down to a hearty, great-tasting meal of the beloved dishes from our restaurant. It's likely these will quickly become your signature dishes, too. OUR BEGINNINGS AND OUR FUTURE Long before he opened the first Carmine's in August of 1990 on New York's Upper West Side, Artie Cutler had been tossing around the idea for a family-style Italian restaurant. His interest was fueled when he attended a friend's wedding held in a suburban backyard where old-fashioned, hearty Italian food, served family-style, filled the guests' plates and helped turn the party into a splendidly boisterous celebration. Artie responded to the warmth and happiness of the occasion as well as its utter lack of pretension. Mostly, he recognized how happily the wedding guests responded to the "real food" and liberal portions. With this in mind, he sharpened his vision for a restaurant that would allow Manhattan's chic yuppies to unwind, a restaurant that would attract their parents and their children as well. Two years after the first Carmine's opened its doors on Broadway and 91st Street, Artie opened another restaurant on 44th Street just west of Broadway."People told him he was nuts," his wife, Alice Cutler, remembers. Times Square had not yet gone through its transformation, and no one thought a restaurant right smack in its heart was a good idea--no one but Artie. He believed the area would very soon become desirable again, says Alice, who now is at the helm of the business. He was right, of course. The 44th Street Carmine's is our busiest and best-known location, and a great favorite with tourists from the United States and all over the world. Clearly, Artie believed in teamwork, and Alice and her partners carry on that tradition today. "As a company, we are like a big family," she says. "A lot of employees have been here for a long time and the restaurant becomes a home away from home. We still have waiters who started with us when we opened the first Carmine's in 1990." One of the happiest examples of Carmine's dedication to upward mobility is Luis Javier, the talented executive chef at 44th Street, who started eighteen years ago as a salad chef. "To see Luis grow from within the company has been a pleasure," says Alice. A tight-knit group of like-minded people, most of whom worked with Artie, work at the New York-based Alicart Restaurant Group, directed by CEO and partner Jeffrey Bank. Alicart operates the four Carmine's restaurants as well as Virgil's BBQ, Gabriela's Mexican, and Artie's Delicatessen. The first two Carmine's are in Manhattan. The others are in the Tropicana Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey; and at the Atlantis on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. There are others in the works. Jeffrey currently has expansion plans on the drawing boards for restaurants in Garden City, Long Island, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Washington, D.C.; and Orlando, Florida. In reality, Carmine's could go anywhere. <i>Carmine's Family-Style Cookbook</i> was put together with the same enthusiasm, attention to detail, and great affection as the restaurants. If we do say so ourselves, we think it's going to be just as big a hit! We hope its pages will soon be stained with red sauce, dribbles of olive oil, and sticky fingerprints, allhappy accidents as you discover our recipes. We trust you will find them as rewarding, delicious, and as mouthwatering as we do. Welcome to Carmine's! THE HEART AND SOUL OF CARMINE'S "Artie loved to eat, and he loved to gamble," says Alice Cutler. He also believed a business with a one-word name was easy for customers to remember, so he took the first name of one of his favorite harness-racing drivers for the restaurant. When the New York State Restaurant Association named Artie Restaurateur of the Year in 1996, Alice recalls, he joked about what a "lucky" man he was because the restaurant business was a "perfect fit" for someone who had a passion for food and liked to gamble. He was a risk taker, his wife says, but Artie was a risk taker with a keen business sense and impeccable instincts. Jeffrey Bank recalls Artie's mantra: "The best deals are the ones you walk away from." When he started building his restaurant empire in the 1980s and lacked a formal office, Artie did most of his business from a bench in the meridian that runs through the center of Broadway on the Upper West Side. After he died, Alice bought that bench at Broadway and 90th Street and put a plaque on it that reads IN MEMORY OF ARTIE, "BUBBA" CUTLER (ARTIE'S FIRST OFFICE). From those early days, Artie had a vision of what made a restaurant work. His legacy is reflected in our big, sprawling, boisterous Italian American restaurants where day after day and night after night hundreds of New Yorkers and out-of-towners sit down to huge portions of great food meant to be shared. "The simplicity of the concept makes it work," explains Gary Bologna, a partner and our chief operating officer, who has been with Carmine's since 1997. "It's about good service, great food, and family style." This is all Artie Cutler. Without his vision, his remarkable energy, and his generosity of spirit, Carmine's would not exist. Those of us who worked with him miss him very much. CARMINE'S KITCHEN We love food, and we love to see people enjoying it, digging into platters piled high with freshly cooked pasta, rich red sauces, tender clams, and perfectly cooked meat and sausage. We appreciate cutting-edge cuisine, but that's not us. Instead, we are true to what we call "grandmother's cooking." Our food is the food you might have eaten on Sunday afternoon if you were part of a typical Italian American family in the Bronx or Brooklyn. Because we are from the city, we think of this as New York Italian, but we know most of our dishes are instantly recognizable in other parts of the country, too, and particularly where there is a concentration of Italian Americans. Carmine's is big and can be noisy, and the number of people who dine with us every day is impressive, with well over 1.3 million customers a year. The sheer volume leads some to assume that high quality cannot be sustained, but nothing could be further from the truth. Alice, our president, readily admits that many of our first-time customers are "blown away" when they taste our food. "Some come in with low expectations," she says, but with the first mouthful, any doubt is dispelled. Running the kitchen on a classic European model is the brainchild of partner and founding chef Michael Ronis. As a classically trained chef, it never occurred to him to organize our kitchens any other way, and so the sauces are finished just before serving, no pasta is cooked until an order is placed, and the hero sandwiches are assembled right before they are carried to the customer. Even after eighteen years, which translates to lots of success and practice, the same close attention is given to all our food. For instance, Glenn Rolnick, corporate executive chef and partner, makes sure that popular dishes such as Penne alla Vodka are consistent from restaurant to restaurant so that customers are never disappointed. Since our food is fresh and nothing is held over, it's been easy to adapt our recipes for your home kitchen. We wouldn't dream of doing anything differently. CARMINE'S WINE CELLAR AND BAR The wine we pour at Carmine's runs the gamut from earthy and gutsy to crisp and refreshing. Our wine list boasts approximately 120 labels, with bottles that are sophisticated enough for anyone who walks through our doors without being precious, esoteric, or expensive. As with our food, our wine is high in quality and a good value. Our customers love our magnums, and with good reason. A magnum is 1.5 liters, or equal to two "normal-sized" 750 ml wine bottles. It's a big, bold bottle that never looks out of place on one of our spacious tables, where the platters are piled high and diners happily serve themselves as they sip theirwine. Both our red magnum and our white magnum are festooned with the handsome Carmine's label, and both are bottled for us in central Italy. They don't hold "just any old wine"--not by a long shot! The wines are from a cooperative in Abruzzo called Casal, where the wine is made expressly for us from carefully selected grapes grown nearby and then bottled and shipped to us, all according to our precise specifications. James Yacyshyn, our beverage director, travels to Abruzzo at least once a year to oversee the process, taste new varietals, and make sure the wine we buy meets our standards as well as the demanding tastes of our customers. There, with the deep blue Adriatic Sea lying at the feet of Casal Bordino and warm breezes wafting from the coastline up to the mountains, the sundrenched vineyards are cool and pleasant. In this breathtaking setting, James tastes some of the finest wines in the world and makes sure they find their way to our cellars. Our red magnum is a Monte Pulciano d'Abruzzo, which is a dry, medium to full-bodied, ruby red pour with nuances of black cherry and licorice. Needless to say, it marries well with our red sauces and red meat dishes, as well...</p><h2>Secret Stairs: A Walking Guide to the Historic Staircases of Los Angeles (Revised September 2020)</h2><p>Containing walks and detailed maps from throughout the city, <i>Secret Stairs</i> highlights the charms and quirks of a unique feature of the Los Angeles landscape, and chronicles the geographical, architectural, and historical aspects of the city&#x2019;s staircases, as well as of the neighborhoods in which the steps are located.<br><br>From strolling through the classic La Loma neighborhood in Pasadena to walking the Sunset Junction Loop in Silver Lake, to taking the Beachwood Canyon hike through Hollywoodland&#x201d; to enjoying the magnificent ocean views from the Castellammare district in Pacific Palisades, <i>Secret Stairs</i> takes you on a tour of the staircases all across the City of Angels.<br><br>The circular walks, rated for duration and difficulty, deliver tales of historic homes and their fascinating inhabitants, bits of unusual local trivia, and stories of the neighborhoods surrounding the stairs.

But even when we can&#x2019;t immediately see God&#x2019;s hand&#x2015;when the struggle is hard and painful&#x2015;he is working. Weaving together Scripture, personal stories, and the words of the classic hymn &#x201c;How Firm a Foundation,&#x201d; David Powlison brings an experienced counselor&#x2019;s touch to exploring how God enters into our sufferings, helping us see God working in our own particular struggles&#x2015;and discover how God&#x2019;s grace goes deeper than we could ever imagine.</p></p><p><p><strong>David Powlison</strong>&nbsp;(1949&#x2013;2019)&nbsp;was a teacher, a counselor, and the executive director of the Christian Counseling &amp; Educational Foundation for many years.

Far from dispensing ivory-tower platitudes, David takes anchors from Scripture and bolts them firmly into our thinking, providing practical steps in embracing the God of the Bible who, incidentally, wrote the book on suffering. David&#x2019;s wisdom has helped me through a significant portion of my years as a quadriplegic, and I highly commend <i>God&#x2019;s Grace in Your Suffering</i>.

Mindy and Bobby were no longer her little babies. They were nearly finished with the first and third grades. They rarely cried anymore, even when the subject of their father came up.<br> <br>And Mrs. Bell&#x2014;Kendra, as Caroline often called her now&#x2014;well, she was an entirely different woman. She no longer slept away the days. She was a good mom. And she worked, which is why it would fall to Caroline to pick the children up from their twice weekly visit to their grandparents&#x2019; apartment on the Upper East Side. It was a task that neither of them enjoyed. Dr. Bell&#x2019;s parents made their son look like a free spirit compared to them.<br> <br>Caroline had made it out of the apartment and halfway to the elevator when she heard the children&#x2019;s grandmother call out behind her. She turned to see both grandparents standing side by side outside their door. Dr. Bell was thin, almost to the point of being gaunt. His wispy hair was combed sideways across the dome of his head. As chief of vascular surgery at prestigious Mount Sinai Medical Center, he had grown accustomed to getting his own way. Nine years into retirement the scowl he had brought to the hospital every day had not diminished in the least.<br> <br>Cynthia Bell, now in her eighties, showed little sign of the beauty that had once been hers. Her long hours in the sun had left her skin wrinkled and dry. Her lips were turned down at the corners, giving the impression of a permanent pout.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; Caroline inquired.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did Kendra even try to get that television producer interested in Martin&#x2019;s case?&#x201d; Dr. Bell asked.<br> <br>Caroline smiled politely. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really not for me to say who Mrs. Bell speaks to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean Kendra,&#x201d; he said sternly. &#x201c;My wife is the only Mrs. Bell. That woman is no longer married to my son, because my son was shot to death in his driveway.&#x201d;<br> <br>Caroline continued to force a pleasant expression. Oh, how she remembered the drama that had unfolded in the living room six months earlier over the subject of that television producer. Robert and Cynthia had asked to come to the house following Mindy&#x2019;s after-school dance recital. They told Kendra all about Under Suspicion, a television show that reinvestigated cold cases. Without notifying Kendra, they had sent a letter to the studio asking them to look into Martin&#x2019;s unsolved murder.<br> <br>The official Mrs. Bell, Cynthia, interjected. &#x201c;Kendra tells us that the producer, a woman named Laurie Moran, passed on the case.&#x201d;<br> <br>Caroline nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what happened.

Paul von Hartmann is on the staff of the German Foreign Office--and secretly a member of the anti-Hitler resistance. The two men were friends at Oxford in the 1920s, but have not been in contact since. Now, when Hugh flies with Chamberlain from London to Munich, and Hartmann travels on Hitler's train overnight from Berlin, their paths are set on a disastrous collision course. And once again, Robert Harris gives us actual events of historical importance--here are Hitler, Chamberlain, Mussolini, Daladier--at the heart of an electrifying, unputdownable novel.</p><p><b>ROBERT HARRIS</b> is the author of eleven novels:&nbsp;<i>Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, The Ghost Writer, Conspirata, The Fear Index, An Officer and a Spy, Dictator</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Conclave.</i>&nbsp;Several of his books have been adapted to film, most recently&nbsp;<i>The Ghost Writer</i>.

Perhaps it was his imagination but it seemed that the guests and even the waiters moving back and forth across the carpet between the dusky pink upholstered chairs were unusually subdued. There was no laughter. Soundlessly beyond the thick plate glass, forty or fifty workmen, some stripped to the waist in the humid weather, were digging slit trenches in Green Park. </p><p><i>There should remain no doubt for the whole world at this time that it is not one man, or one leader, who speaks but the whole German people. I know that in this hour the whole people&#x2014;millions strong&#x2014;agree with every one of my words (Heil). </i></p><p>He had listened to it on the BBC as it was delivered. Metallic, remorseless, threatening, self-pitying, boastful&#x2014;impressive in its horrible way&#x2014;it had been punctuated by the thumps of Hitler&#x2019;s hand pounding the podium and by the roar of fifteen thousand voices shouting their approval. The noise was inhuman, unearthly. It had seemed to well up from some black subterranean river and pour out of the loudspeaker. </p><p><i>I am grateful to Mr. Chamberlain for all his efforts, and I have assured him that the German people want nothing but peace. I have further assured him, and I emphasise it now, that when this problem is solved, Germany has no more territorial problems in Europe. </i></p><p>Legat took out his fountain pen and underlined the passage, and then did the same with another, earlier reference to the Anglo&#x2013;German Naval Agreement: </p><p><i>Such an agreement is only morally justified if both nations promise one another solemnly never to wage war against one another again. Germany has this will. Let us all hope that those who are of the same conviction will gain the upper hand among the British people. </i></p><p>He put aside the paper and checked his pocket watch. It was characteristic of him not to carry the time on his wrist like most men of his age but rather on the end of a chain. He was only twenty-eight yet seemed older&#x2014;his face pale, his manner grave, his suit dark. He had made the reservation a fortnight ago, before the crisis had blown up. Now he felt guilty. He would give her another five minutes; then he would have to leave. </p><p>It was a quarter-past when he glimpsed her reflection between the flowers in the wall of gilded mirrors. She was standing on the edge of the restaurant, practically on tiptoe, peering around blankly, her long white neck extended, her chin tilted upwards. He studied her for a few more moments as if she were a stranger and wondered what on earth he would make of her if she were not his wife. &#x201c;A striking figure&#x201d;&#x2014;that was the sort of thing people said of her. &#x201c;Not pretty, exactly.&#x201d; &#x201c;No, but handsome.&#x201d; &#x201c;Pamela&#x2019;s what one calls a <i>thoroughbred.</i>&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, tremendous breeding&#x2014;and entirely out of poor Hugh&#x2019;s league . . .&#x201d; (This latter he had overheard at the party to celebrate their engagement.) He raised his hand. He stood. Finally, she noticed him, smiled and waved and moved towards him, cutting quickly between the tables in her tight skirt and tailored silk jacket, leaving a wake of turned heads. </p><p>She kissed him firmly on the mouth. She was slightly out of breath. &#x201c;Sorry, sorry, sorry . . .&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. I&#x2019;ve only just arrived.&#x201d; Over the past twelve months he had learned not to ask where she had been. As well as her handbag she was carrying a small cardboard box. She placed it on the table in front of him and pulled off her gloves. </p><p>&#x201c;I thought we agreed no presents?&#x201d; He lifted the lid. A black rubber skull, a metal snout and the vacant glassy eye-sockets of a gas mask stared back up at him. He recoiled. </p><p>&#x201c;I took the children for a fitting. Apparently, I&#x2019;m to put theirs on first. That will test one&#x2019;s maternal devotion, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; She lit a cigarette. &#x201c;Could I have a drink? I&#x2019;m parched.&#x201d; </p><p>He signalled to the waiter. </p><p>&#x201c;Only a half-bottle?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I have to work this afternoon.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Of course you do! I wasn&#x2019;t sure you&#x2019;d even show.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I ought not to have done, to be honest. I tried to call but you weren&#x2019;t at home.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, now you know where I was. A perfectly innocent explanation.&#x201d; She smiled and leaned towards him. They clinked glasses. &#x201c;Happy anniversary, darling.&#x201d; </p><p>In the park, the workmen swung their picks. </p><p>She ordered quickly, without even looking at the menu: no starter, Dover sole off the bone, green salad. Legat handed back his menu and said he&#x2019;d have the same. He couldn&#x2019;t think about food, couldn&#x2019;t rid his mind of the image of his children wearing gas masks. John was three, Diana two. All that cautioning of them not to run too fast, to wrap up warm, not to suck on toys or crayons because you never knew where they might have been. He put the box under the table and pushed it out of sight with his foot. </p><p>&#x201c;Were they very frightened?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Of course not. They thought the whole thing was a game.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Do you know, sometimes I feel exactly that? Even if you see the telegrams it&#x2019;s difficult not to think it&#x2019;s all just some ghastly joke. A week ago it looked as though it had all been fixed. Then Hitler changed his mind.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What will happen now?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Who can say? Possibly nothing.&#x201d; He felt he should try to sound optimistic. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re still talking in Berlin&#x2014;at least they were when I left the office.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And if they stop talking, when will it start?&#x201d; </p><p>He showed her the headline in <i>The Times </i>and shrugged. &#x201c;I suppose tomorrow.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Really? As soon as that?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He says he&#x2019;ll cross the Czech border on Saturday. Our military experts reckon it will take him three days to get his tanks and artillery in position. That means he&#x2019;ll have to mobilise tomorrow.&#x201d; He tossed the paper back on the table and drank some champagne; it tasted like acid in his mouth. &#x201c;I tell you what&#x2014;let&#x2019;s change the subject.&#x201d; </p><p>From his jacket pocket he produced a ring-box. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Hugh!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It will be too big,&#x201d; he warned her. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, but it&#x2019;s charming!&#x201d; She slipped the ring on to her finger, held up her hand and turned it back and forth beneath the chandelier so that the blue stone glinted in the light. &#x201c;You are a wonder. I thought we hadn&#x2019;t any money?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t. It was my mother&#x2019;s.&#x201d; </p><p>He had been afraid she might think him cheap, but to his surprise she reached her hand across the table and laid it on his. &#x201c;You are sweet.&#x201d; Her skin was cool. Her slim forefinger stroked his wrist. </p><p>&#x201c;I wish we could take a room,&#x201d; he said suddenly, &#x201c;and stay in bed all afternoon. Forget about Hitler. Forget about the children.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, why don&#x2019;t you see if you can arrange it? We&#x2019;re here. What&#x2019;s to stop us?&#x201d; She held his gaze with her large grey-blue eyes and he saw, with a sudden insight that caught him in his throat, that she was only saying it because she knew it would never happen. </p><p>Behind him a man coughed politely. &#x201c;Mr. Legat?&#x201d; Pamela took away her hand. He turned to find the ma�tre d&#x2019;, palms pressed together as in prayer, grave with self-importance. </p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Number Ten Downing Street are on the line for you, sir.&#x201d; He was careful to say it just loudly enough for the neighbouring tables to hear. </p><p>&#x201c;Hell!&#x201d; Legat stood and threw down his napkin. &#x201c;Will you excuse me? I&#x2019;ll have to take it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I understand. You go and save the world.&#x201d; She waved him on his way. &#x201c;We can have lunch any time.&#x201d; She started packing her things into her handbag. </p><p>&#x201c;Just give me a minute.&#x201d; There was a pleading edge to his voice. &#x201c;We really have to talk.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Go.&#x201d; </p><p>He hovered for a moment, conscious of the nearby diners staring at him. &#x201c;Do wait,&#x201d; he said. He assumed what he hoped was a neutral expression and followed the ma�tre d&#x2019; out of the restaurant and into the lobby. </p><p>&#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d like some privacy, sir.&#x201d; The ma�tre d&#x2019; opened a door to a small office. On the desk was a telephone, the handset beside it. </p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; He picked up the receiver and waited until the door had closed before he spoke. &#x201c;Legat.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, Hugh.&#x201d; He recognised the voice of Cecil Syers, one of his colleagues in the Private Office. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;re going to have to come back right away. It&#x2019;s about to get rather hectic. Cleverly is asking for you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Has something happened?&#x201d; </p><p>There was a hesitation at the other end. The Private Secretaries were told always to assume the operator was listening in. &#x201c;It looks as though the talking&#x2019;s over. Our man is flying home.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Understood. I&#x2019;m on my way.&#x201d; </p><p>He replaced the receiver on its cradle. For a moment he stood paralysed. Was this what History felt like? Germany would attack Czechoslovakia. France would declare war on Germany. Britain would support France. His children would wear gas masks. The diners at the Ritz would abandon their white linen tablecloths to crouch in slit trenches in Green Park. It was all too much to grasp. </p><p>He opened the door and hurried back across the lobby into the restaurant. But such was the efficiency of the Ritz&#x2019;s staff their table was already cleared. </p><p>In Piccadilly there was not a taxi to be had. He danced back and forth in the gutter, vainly waving his rolled-up newspaper at every passing cab. Finally, he gave up, rounded the corner into St. James&#x2019;s Street and set off down the hill. From time to time he glanced across the road in the hope he might see his wife. Where had she gone in such a hurry? If she was walking straight home to Westminster, this was the direction she would have to take. Best not to think of it; best never to think of it. Already he was sweating in the unseasonable heat. Beneath his old-fashioned three-piece suit, he could feel his shirt sticking to his back. Yet the sky was dull, threatening a rain that somehow never came, and all along Pall Mall, behind the tall windows of the great London clubs&#x2014;the Royal Automobile, the Reform, the Athenaeum&#x2014;the chandeliers glittered in the humid gloom. </p><p>He did not slacken his pace until he reached the top of the steps leading down from Carlton House Terrace to St. James&#x2019;s Park. Here he found his path blocked by a silent crowd of twenty watching what looked like a small airship rising slowly behind the Houses of Parliament. It ascended past the spire of Big Ben, an oddly beautiful sight&#x2014;majestic, surreal. In the distance he could make out half a dozen others in the sky south of the Thames&#x2014;tiny silver torpedoes, some already thousands of feet high. </p><p>The man beside him murmured, &#x201c;I suppose you could say the balloon&#x2019;s gone up.&#x201d; </p><p>Legat glanced at him. He remembered his father using exactly the same expression when he was home on leave during the Great War. He had to go back to France <i>because the balloon had gone up. </i>To Hugh&#x2019;s six-year-old ears it had sounded as if he was going off to a party. It was the last time he had seen him. </p><p>He edged his way around the spectators, trotted down the three wide flights of steps, across the Mall and into Horse Guards Road. And here, in the centre of the sandy expanse of the parade ground, in the half-hour since he left, something else had happened. A pair of anti-aircraft guns had appeared. Soldiers were unloading sandbags from a flatbed lorry, working quickly as if they feared the Luftwaffe might appear at any moment, passing them from hand to hand along a human chain. A half-built wall of sandbags surrounded a searchlight battery. A gunner furiously turned a wheel; one of the barrels swung around and elevated until it was almost perpendicular. </p><p>Legat took out a large white cotton handkerchief and wiped his face. It would not do to turn up red-faced and perspiring. If there was one sin that was frowned upon above all others in the Private Office, it was appearing to be in a flap. </p><p>He climbed the steps into the narrow, shadowed, soot-blackened cutting of Downing Street. On the pavement opposite Number 10, a group of reporters turned their heads to follow his arrival. A photographer raised his camera, but when he saw it was no one of importance he lowered it again. Legat nodded to the policeman, who rapped once, hard, with the knocker. The door opened as if of its own volition. He stepped inside. </p><p>It was four months since he had been seconded from the Foreign Office to work in Number 10 yet each time he felt the same sensation: as if he were entering some gentlemen&#x2019;s club that was no longer fashionable&#x2014;the black-and-white-tiled lobby, the walls of Pompeiian red, the brass lantern, the grandfather clock ticking its leisurely heartbeat, the cast-iron umbrella stand with its solitary black umbrella. Somewhere in the depths of the building a telephone rang. The doorkeeper wished Legat a good afternoon and returned to his leather coachman&#x2019;s seat and his copy of the <i>Evening Standard. </i></p><p>In the wide passageway leading to the back of the building Legat paused and checked himself in the mirror. He straightened his tie and smoothed down his hair with both hands; he braced his shoulders; turned. Ahead of him was the Cabinet Room, its panelled door closed. To his left, the office used by Sir Horace Wilson, also closed. To his right, the corridor that led to the offices of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Private Secretaries. The Georgian house exuded an air of imperturbable calm. </p><p>Miss Watson, with whom he shared the smallest office, was bent over her desk, exactly as he had left her, walled in by piles of folders. Only the top of her grey head was visible. She had begun her career as a typist when Lloyd George was Prime Minister. He was said to have chased the Downing Street girls around the Cabinet table. It was hard to imagine him chasing Miss Watson. Her responsibility was preparing answers for Parliamentary questions. She peered at Legat over her barricade of papers. &#x201c;Cleverly has been in looking for you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Is he with the PM?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s in his office. The PM&#x2019;s in the Cabinet Room with the Big Three.&#x201d; </p><p>Legat made a noise that was between a sigh and a groan. Halfway along the corridor, he stuck his head into Syers&#x2019;s office. &#x201c;All right, Cecil, how much trouble am I in?&#x201d; </p><p>Syers swung round in his chair. He was a small man, seven years Legat&#x2019;s senior, constantly and irrepressibly and often irritatingly amused. He wore the same college tie as Legat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid you picked rather the wrong day for a romantic lunch, old fellow.&#x201d; His voice dropped sympathetically. &#x201c;I hope she didn&#x2019;t take it badly.&#x201d; </p><p>Once, in a weak moment, Legat had hinted to Syers of his diffculties at home. He had regretted it ever since. &#x201c;Not at all. Things are on an even keel. What happened in Berlin?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Apparently it degenerated into one of Herr Hitler&#x2019;s tirades.&#x201d; Syers pretended to str...</p></p><h2>Fruits Basket Collector&#39;s Edition, Vol. 7 (Fruits Basket Collector&#39;s Edition, 7)</h2><p>Yuki-alongside his mother, who already has his life after high school all mapped out-confronts his future at a parent-teacher conference.

If your partner has PTSD, you may want to help, but find yourself at a loss.</p><p>The simple truth is that PTSD can be extremely debilitating&#x2015;not just for the person who has experienced trauma first-hand, but for their partners as well. And while there are many books written for those suffering from PTSD, there are few written for the people who love them. In <em>Loving Someone with PTSD</em>, renowned trauma expert and author of <em>I Can&#x2019;t Get Over It!</em>, Aphrodite Matsakis, presents concrete skills and strategies for the partners of those with PTSD.</p><p>With this informative and practical book, you will increase your understanding of the signs and symptoms of PTSD, improve your communication skills with your loved one, set realistic expectations, and work to create a healthy environment for the both of you. In addition, you will learn to manage your own grief, helplessness, and fear regarding your partner&#x2019;s condition.</p><p>PTSD is a manageable disability. While it isn&#x2019;t your responsibility to rescue your partner or act as his or her therapist, this book will help you be supportive and implement strategies for lessening the negative impact of PTSD&#x2015;not just for your partner, but for your relationship, and, importantly, for yourself.</p></p><p><strong>Aphrodite T. Matsakis, PhD</strong>, is an internationally recognized expert in trauma and the author of several books dealing with traumatic reactions, including <em>I Can't Get Over It!, Trust After Trauma, The Rape Recovery Handbook</em>, and <em>Vietnam Wives: Women and Children Facing the Challenge of Living with Veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</em>. Matsakis has over thirty-five years of experience working with veterans, abused persons, and other trauma survivors; has taught at several major universities; and has conducted dozens of seminars for trauma survivors and trauma therapists.&#x201c;Aphrodite T. Matsakis has once again captured the essence of the experience of individuals living with PTSD. This time, she has focused on helping those who love survivors understand the complexities and nuances of the issue. Matsakis has skillfully laid out key communication skills to utilize, as well as the common pitfalls to avoid in order to create trusting relationships.

Matsakis has been helping people understand and cope with post-traumatic difficulties. In her latest book, <em>Loving Someone with PTSD</em>, she turns her focus to the survivor&#x2019;s relationship with the intimate partner. As always, Matsakis&#x2019;s advice is rock solid, down-to-earth, and immediately applicable. Bolstered by thought-provoking questionnaires and exercises, she guides the reader to create a safer, more authentic relationship that will sustain both survivor and loved one. This book will benefit everyone who cares about someone who has been touched by trauma.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Don R.

The caregivers often suffer silently, not knowing what to think or what to do. Aphrodite T. Matsakis has done a magnificent job describing a loved one&#x2019;s distress when trying to help and cope with a partner&#x2019;s PTSD. The author covers issues such as the feeling of helplessness, not only in the PTSD survivors, but in the comforters. Matsakis explains PTSD symptoms, how difficult it is to communicate with a PTSD sufferer, and psychological triggers that may drive a survivor into a rage. She also shows readers how to cope with a survivor&#x2019;s panic attacks, addictions, suicidal thinking, alcoholism, and drug addiction. She describes common therapies and lists the right questions to ask a person in pain and in despair. <em>Loving Someone with PTSD</em> is a stunning achievement, a beautifully written book that flows from the heart with simplicity and clarity.

But when the squire is forced to sell his horses, Black Beauty&#39;s life changes as he is passed form one cruel master to another. After much hardship and perserverance, Black Beauty finally finds a home full of love and kindness. This easy to read adaptation of the classic novel is guaranteed to hook beginning readers not yet ready to tackle the original.</p><p>A horse is a horse of course unless of course the horse is Black Beauty. Animal-loving children have been devoted to <i>Black Beauty</i> throughout this century, and no doubt will continue through the next. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of turn-of-the-century London, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness.<p> <i>Black Beauty</i> tells the story of the horse's own long and varied life, from a well-born colt in a pleasant meadow to an elegant carriage horse for a gentleman to a painfully overworked cab horse. Throughout, Sewell rails--in a gentle, 19th-century way--against animal maltreatment. Young readers will follow Black Beauty's fortunes, good and bad, with gentle masters as well as cruel. Children can easily make the leap from horse-human relationships to human-human relationships, and begin to understand how their own consideration of others may be a benefit to all. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p>This edition is printed in specially-designed large type for easier reading, and is printed on non-glare paper.</p><h2>Yotsuba&amp;!, Vol. 2 (Yotsuba&amp;!, 2)</h2><p>Ohhhhh!

But he&#39;s too big to draw in Yotsuba&#39;s sketchbook! So Yotsuba drew Jumbo on the street in front of our house! Cool, huh? But Ena&#39;s friend Miura, who has wheels on her feet, said Yotsuba was bad at drawing...she&#39;s wrong, right? RIGHT!?</p><p>Kiyohiko Azuma is the bestselling creator of AZUMANGA DAIOH and the critically acclaimed YOTSUBA&amp;! which won the Excellence Prize in the manga category at the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The series was also nominated for an Eisner Award in the U.S. in 2008 and has been a regular <i>New York Times </i>bestseller.Yotsuba is an overactive school-age girl of possibly alien origins who's been adopted by a single dad, Koiwai. While this setup has been the launching point for countless adventure manga, Azuma produces something far more rare and charming: an all-ages story about the real world. Yotsuba is incredibly energetic and insatiably curious about the world. Throw in her ignorance about some of the most basic aspects of life and her own off-kilter take on everything, and you have a gentle comedy that goes from slapstick to sly, character-based humor. The supporting cast includes the three sisters who live next door, pretty Asagi, responsible Fuka and patient Ena. There's also Jumbo, Koiwai's towering male friend. Together, this little cast acts out simple but engaging slice-of-life stories. In one, Ena's friend Miura tells Yotsuba that her drawings aren't very good, leading to a crisis over lying and hurt feelings. In a more slapstick tale, Yotsuba draws on her sleeping father's face with marker and then attempts to remove the marks with mayonnaise, making for some sidesplitting visuals. Nothing much happens in <i>Yotsuba&amp;!</i>, but Azuma's bold, sure art handles Yotsuba's emotional range perfectly and creates a sweet world of friendship and discovery. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Delve into Jim and Jamie Dutcher&#x2019;s amazing wolf photography documenting a pack of wolves at the edge of Idaho's Sawtooth Wilderness, illuminating their complex social hierarchy. Here is the alpha pair, leaders of the pack, often the only couple that mate. Here are the pups, born with eyes shut in the spring, tousled by their mother through the first six weeks of life. Here is the omega wolf, lowest ranking wolf in the pack, whose subservience, often playful, alleviates pack tension. Here are moments of cooperation and moments of snarling dominance, moments of communication and affection. Here, too, are heartwarming moments of connection between the Dutchers and the wolves, caught in pictures that remind us how close the links are between wolves in the wild and the beloved family dog.&nbsp;<br><br> Short chapters introduce the wolves as individuals, describe the Dutchers' years of coming to know them, and address the complex conservation issues surrounding the near-extinction and now replenishment of the species in the wild. Sidebars explore myths about wolves, including Native American spirit stories, European fairy tales, and modern ranching hearsay.</p><p>JIM DUTCHER is an Emmy Award-winning filmmaker and cinematographer whose extraordinary camerawork has led audiences into places never before filmed: inside beaver lodges, down burrows to peek at wolf pups, and into the secret life of a mother mountain lion. His work includes the National Geographic special, <i>A Rocky Mountain Beaver Pond</i>, and ABC World of Discovery's two highest-rated films, <i>Cougar: Ghost of the Rockies,</i> and <i>Wolf: Return of a Legend.</i> JAMIE DUTCHER, Jim's wife and co-producer, has worked in the animal hospital of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., bringing her knowledge of animal husbandry and medical care to film and enabling her to quickly gain access to the sensitive and secret inner lives of wolves. The author lives in Idaho.Drive north on Highway 75 into central Idaho, and you&#x2019;ll soon find yourself winding up a steep mountain road toward Galena Pass. Beyond this threshold, the ground drops away into the Sawtooth Valley. The headwaters of the Salmon River trickle down these slopes and gather in the valley below. There, a few ranches nestle close to the river with their backs to the vast wilderness. Above it all, the craggy spine of the Sawtooth Mountains looms to the west. The Sawtooths shoot boldly out of the valley floor, soaring gray walls in a blazing blue sky. It&#x2019;s a Wild West setting that rivals the more famous Grand Teton National Park.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tucked away at the base of these mountains lies a bright ripar- ian meadow. Tiny braided streams course though the grass, nourishing stands of willow and aspen before flowing into a lively mountain brook. Thick stands of spruce and lodgepole pine guard the perimeter, break- ing just enough to reveal the Sawtooths in stunning backdrop. We had searched for the better part of a year for the perfect spot to create our wolf camp, facing a maddening list of criteria. It had to be far enough into the wilderness to avoid attracting attention or bothering the local resi- dents, but it had to be accessible by four-wheel drive in the summer and snowmobile in the winter. It also had to be an area that the U.S. Forest Service would allow us to use. Above all, it had to be suitable wolf habitat with fresh water, a mix of cover and open space, and good places for denning. The moment we set foot in this meadow, we knew we&#x2019;d found the spot. From the hushed beauty of a spruce forest blanketed in new snow, to the pastel spray of spring wildflowers, to the bold reds and golds of autumn, it was all that we as filmmakers could have hoped for.<br> &nbsp;<br> More important, the land offered everything a pack of wolves would need. There were dense patches of forest and a maze of willows where they could seclude themselves and feel safe. There was a pond of spring water to drink from and to splash in. Fallen trees offered a choice of denning sites, and a grassy meadow provided a sunny nursery for raising pups. The wolves genuinely seemed to love being there.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolf camp was an ever-evolving project. After securing permits from the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, we had to get permission from three local ranchers to cross their land. Wolf reintroduction was four years in the future, but it was already a contentious issue. During the autumn of 1990, we staked out 25 acres, creating the world&#x2019;s largest wolf enclosure. Just outside the enclosure, we set up two sleeping tents and a round Mongolian-style yurt, which became a cook tent, a work- space, and the center of camp life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Maintaining the camp and caring for the wolf pack was a seven-day-a-week job. The long Idaho winters were especially laborious. When three feet of snow piled up in a single day, we had to keep our tent roofs swept free, lest they collapse under the weight. We had to haul and chop a steady supply of firewood, especially for nights when temperatures dropped to 40� below zero. And we always made sure we had a clear path to the outhouse. Critically, we had to maintain contact with the local sheriff&#x2019;s department. If a deer, elk, or antelope turned up dead on the highway, we had permission to collect it for wolf food.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few seasons into the project, we made a simple alteration that proved revelatory. We built a platform eight feet off the ground inside the wolves&#x2019; territory, put the yurt on top, our sleeping tent on the ground beside it, and encircled it with chain-link fencing. Suddenly we were no longer entering and exiting the wolves&#x2019; space every day; we became a constant fixture within it. More than ever, the wolves just ignored us. By this time, the pack was a mature family of six males and two females, and they began to reveal their lives in rich detail. When we remember the Sawtooth Pack, we remember them most fondly from this time.</p><h2>Frogs</h2><p><b>From tiny tadpoles to massive master jumpers, explore the lives of frogs in this detailed introduction! </b> <br><br>How far can frogs jump?

I bet you also remember the tremendous sense of responsibility to get it right as well, the realization that this tiny being is totally dependent on you and you want to give him everything he needs and be the best parent possible. Throughout the first twelve months or so of your baby&#x2019;s life, you were focused on meeting his needs for sleep, food, and stimulation, as well as all the other developmental milestones that come in that first year. Once you figured out what his various cries meant and a schedule to meet those needs, life with your little one made you a bit more confident, didn&#x2019;t it? You felt proud you got through the first year and adjusted well, with thousands of photos to prove it.<br><br>Then she starts walking and one day, as you&#x2019;re trying to get her to do something&#x2014;perhaps get her clothes on, or get her in her car seat&#x2014;it happens. She digs in her heels and throws a wobbly: kicking like a Premier League soccer player, screaming at the top of her lungs, throwing herself down on the ground. Hello . . . and welcome to the toddler tantrum.<br><br>But it isn&#x2019;t just tantrums you have to deal with now. Suddenly you have a Mini-Me who tells you what she does and doesn&#x2019;t want. She&#x2019;s a bundle of contradictions. She wants independence&#x2014;and she wants you to do everything for her. One minute it&#x2019;s &#x201c;Feed me!&#x201d;&#x2014;the next she&#x2019;s refusing to eat. She wants to pour her own milk, but it spills all over. She wants to get out of the stroller and walk, but she won&#x2019;t stay by your side and you&#x2019;re afraid she&#x2019;ll dart out into the street. She&#x2019;s learned the power of the word no and uses it as frequently as possible: no, she doesn&#x2019;t want to go to bed; no, she doesn&#x2019;t want to share her toy; no, she doesn&#x2019;t want to sit at the table in the restaurant . . . No, no, no, no.<br><br>Now what you need to give your child is more challenging than ever before. You want to give her all she needs in order to grow into a happy, healthy, productive adult with good morals, healthy boundaries, and the ability to function well in the world. You see the long-term vision in your mind. And you still want to be the best parent possible so that one day when she&#x2019;s grown, she&#x2019;ll look back and say, &#x201c;You did a good job, Mom. Thank you.&#x201d; Parents know that when you have a child you get the title, but here&#x2019;s where you start to earn it.<br><br>Take a moment now and think of a picture that represents your desire to give your child the best. Is it you and your little one snuggled warm and cozy in bed while you read a story? Is it pushing her on a swing and her belly laughing in the wind with delight? Is it the classic holiday card with you and your spouse surrounded by your smiling children? Whatever it is, take a moment to visualize it. Freeze the image. See it in color. Experience how happy and content that picture makes you feel.<br><br>That picture is possible. You can have it. But it takes knowing what fundamentals you need to put in place, the skills you must have to get there, and the discipline to do what&#x2019;s needed day after day for years. Remember, you&#x2019;re aiming to be a conscious parent to your toddler, the person who consistently provides for your child. To achieve this, you have to make sure your child has:<br><br>�The right amount of sleep<br><br>�Consistent mealtimes with proper portions and the right kinds of foods<br><br>�Opportunities for getting out and about, for physical activity, stimulation, and socialization<br><br>�Early learning activities to help with child development<br><br>�A clear sense of your family&#x2019;s expectations for behavior, and appropriate corrections when necessary<br><br>Of course parenting is 24/7 throughout childhood. But what you give in the toddler years are paramount. That&#x2019;s an incredible responsibility, one that should be held in much regard and respect. You have been given the gift of raising a human being in this life. Not to mention for those of you who already know me, my techniques are tried, tested, and proven. You&#x2019;ve seen me do them hundreds of times.<br><br>So often I hear parents say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have the time.&#x201d; I read somewhere recently that over 40 percent of today&#x2019;s parents say that they don&#x2019;t have time to think about how to keep their children safe in their own homes. That&#x2019;s so rudimentary that it is inconceivable to me! But if they can&#x2019;t even think of their toddler&#x2019;s physical safety, how can they possibly put these five cornerstones in place? Your interest in this book tells me that you are part of the other 60 percent&#x2014;parents who realize the importance of putting in the needed time, and of trying hard to get things right from the start. Not the clich� of &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried, but it doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x201d;<br><br>Imagine you are holding two packs of playing cards. One has cards that say obesity, type 2 diabetes, poor attention and other learning issues, and social relationship problems. The other has cards that say health, learning up to one&#x2019;s potential, fruitful relationships, and the ability to function well in the world. Which pack do you want to hand to your child? It&#x2019;s not rocket science, right? I&#x2019;ve seen what a lack of these basics does. I&#x2019;ve seen children delayed in their speech, arrested in their development, and having trouble socializing with other children. I&#x2019;ve seen children frustrated by wanting to learn but not being able to because they haven&#x2019;t been taught to sit down and pay attention. I&#x2019;ve seen children eat and eat and be given praise for being on their third helping, when it&#x2019;s been shown this overfeeding is a setup for obesity and type 2 diabetes while still in childhood. I&#x2019;ve seen two- and three-year-olds who act aggressively and have been given no guidance or boundaries turn into bullies and be kicked out of school at age six.<br><br>I know you don&#x2019;t want those consequences for your child, and I also know that what I am asking you to do takes time and energy. That&#x2019;s why I say you need to be a disciplined parent. It takes discipline to feed your child right, to make sure he gets to bed on time, to teach the early learning activities that will stimulate his brain, to teach him how to be out in public safely and to play nicely with others, to reinforce positive behavior and to curb naughty behavior. And it takes discipline to create and follow a routine to provide everything you need to in a day. With routine comes organization, good timekeeping, and the ability to do everything that needs to get done, not just for your child but for you too! In doing so, you can all have fun.<br><br>I remember a Colorado family I worked with. They were juggling running their household and running their own company out of their house. The mother had no set times for work and focusing on the kids. She felt guilty they weren&#x2019;t getting enough of her attention, so she kept them up too late; as a result, they weren&#x2019;t getting the amount of sleep they needed. Being overtired and missing her led to her youngest getting up in the middle of the night, and she&#x2019;d feel so guilty that she&#x2019;d let him stay up, creating more tiredness. I helped her divide her day so that she could do what was necessary with her young ones and still have time to work. That plus putting the Sleep Separation technique (page 72) in place turned the situation around.<br><br>The Five-Tooler<br><br>The metaphor I like to use for what parents need to be is a five-tooler. In baseball, a five-tooler is a player who excels at hitting for average, hitting for power, baserunning with speed, throwing, and fielding. He is disciplined in five areas of the sport. I&#x2019;m asking you to become a five-tooler&#x2014;a disciplined parent in the areas of <br><br>�eating<br><br>�sleeping<br><br>�going out<br><br>�early learning<br><br>�behavior<br><br>A baseball player usually shows strength more in some than others, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean he doesn&#x2019;t work on the other areas. You too may find that one or two of the five come easier for you. That&#x2019;s okay. It just indicates where you need to keep improving.<br><br>By becoming a five-tooler, you&#x2019;ll become a better parent, one who knows that you are making a profound impact in your little one&#x2019;s life, not just now but for later on too. That requires thinking long term. Some parents do this better than others. We live in a society that wants quick turn arounds. But trust me, there are no short cuts. So many parents are just trying to get through the day or the week. When you think long term, you pull that healthy frozen meal out of the fridge more often rather than running to the drive-through. You take the time to notice and praise your child for what she&#x2019;s done well. You read that story again even though you&#x2019;re sick of it. And though it may be easier for you when it&#x2019;s eight o&#x2019;clock at night and you&#x2019;ve just come back from some event to tuck her in quickly, you recognize the importance of the bedtime ritual, so you do a shortened version of your usual routine.<br><br>Why All Five Matter<br><br>These five basic rules are extremely interrelated. If you don&#x2019;t provide healthy food, restful sleep, great socialization, and stimulation, behavior problems will increase. And if you don&#x2019;t deal effectively with behavior issues, you will have trouble with bedtimes, eating, getting along with others, and sitting still long enough to learn.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s an example. When I first started helping families on television, I worked with a young mother who had a little boy. He could not sit down and focus on anything for even one minute! When I spoke to him, I wondered, &#x201c;Is he partially deaf, or has he just got selective hearing?&#x201d;<br><br>So I tried an experiment. &#x201c;Who wants ice cream?&#x201d; I asked. Well, he heard that! But as soon as I said to him, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s tidy up now,&#x201d; the words fell on deaf ears. So I knew he chose what to listen to. His parents gave him no consequences for naughty behavior, and because they hadn&#x2019;t gotten a grip on that, they&#x2019;d lost the motivation to do early learning activities such as reading to him, because all he wanted to do was damage the book or puzzle.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t have any social skills either, because he&#x2019;d never been taught to expand his attention, to understand the rules of a game, and to take turns. We were playing Chutes and Ladders, but he couldn&#x2019;t enjoy it because he couldn&#x2019;t sit still long enough to learn how to play. He ended up throwing the board in frustration.<br><br>Yes, this child had behavior issues, but he had learning and socialization issues as well. I taught his mother how to put boundaries, expectations, and consequences in place. I helped her learn how to expand his attention span. I helped her teach him the importance of taking turns with others. I helped her put a good routine in place so that he was getting proper sleep and nutrition at the right times. And last but not least I helped her connect lovingly with him again so that she could praise him, cuddle him, and give him love. These efforts, taken together, turned the situation around for the better.<br><br>Love and Affection Too!<br><br>When talking about the five basic rules, I want to make sure you understand that they are all done with love. I want you not to forget how important it is to hug, to kiss, to cuddle, to speak to your child kindly and with respect. I can tell when children are held and cuddled frequently and given lots of warmth and love&#x2014;their exterior is soft and their spirit fed. I&#x2019;ve spoken to parents who say they were never hugged as children, so being affectionate may not come naturally. And I know that when kids are misbehaving and parents don&#x2019;t know what to do, they can unconsciously withdraw from their children and therefore give fewer cuddles and hugs. When you&#x2019;ve had a difficult time with your child, in addition to disciplining when necessary, make sure to surround him with your love. Detach his behavior from his core. Hug him, kiss him, hold him. He will soften and the bond between you will grow stronger.<br><br>I remember working with a family of five kids headed by a single mother whose husband had just walked out on her. She said, &#x201c;The kids are being so naughty. I just can&#x2019;t get them to behave.&#x201d; I saw her kids throwing food at the table, not going to bed at night, hitting, and fighting. I mean, everything needed sorting out!<br><br>What those kids needed most, before I could do anything else, was love, comfort, and stability. They missed their dad and were acting out as a result. I gave lots of cuddles and hugs. When they got angry and threw something, instead of going on to the Naughty Step (a form of Time Out that I&#x2019;ll talk about later), they went into a corner where they could paint, draw, or read while they calmed down. After they were comforted and loved, I could then put a healthy routine in place with early learning, proper bedtimes, and so on. As they began to heal, only then did I start to implement discipline. Because you hope to heal what&#x2019;s broken, first with love before the rest can be dealt with.<br><br>Creating a Routine<br><br>As you&#x2019;ll see when I discuss the rule for each basic childhood need, putting routines in place is a common theme. Young children love routine because it&#x2019;s predictable&#x2014;they know what&#x2019;s coming next. Recently I came across research that backs up my belief. It turns out that when a young child&#x2019;s environment is chaotic or disorderly, it negatively influences the development of her cortex, the part of the brain responsible for good judgment. So the more orderly your daily life, the better support you are providing for her brain to grow well. That&#x2019;s a powerful incentive!<br><br>To create a routine, start with a consideration of the amount of sleep your child needs. See page 50 for a list of appropriate total hours of sleep by age. Then work out when she needs to go to sleep and wake up. Schedule the rest around the sleep times: breakfast, getting ready, getting to day care or having morning learning activities, snack, more activities, lunch, nap if she&#x2019;s still doing it, snack, play inside or out, dinner, bedtime ritual, bed. (See the &#x201c;Sample Routine&#x201d; box for a sample.) You will clearly see there are two snacks per day, three mealtimes; five and a half hours dedicated to mental and physical activities for your toddler, and one or two nap times or rest periods, depending on age. This also gives you a break as well, time when you can recharge.</p><h2>One Race One Blood: The Biblical Answer to Racism (Revised &amp; Updated)</h2><p><p><em>One Race One Blood</em> reveals the origins of the horrors of discrimination, the biblical truth of "interracial" marriage, as well as the proof revealed in the Bible that God created only one race.

If you stay with it, you'll find that not only will you stop complaining, but others around you will cease to do so as well and in a short period of time, you'll have a more positive life.&nbsp;<br><i><br>&#x201c;<i>A Complaint Free World</i> is an engaging, enjoyable, easy-to-read reminder that the only permanent, constructive changes you can make in the world are the changes that you make in yourself.&#x201d;<br> &#x2013;Gary Zukav, author of <i>The Seat of the Soul </i>and<i> Soul to Soul </i><br></i></p><p><p><b>WILL BOWEN</b> is the founder of the organization&nbsp;<i>A Complaint Free World</i>&nbsp;and works with individuals and organizations around the world to create Complaint Free environments that are calmer, happier and more productive.</p><b>Chapter 1 </b><br><b>I Complain Therefore I Am<br></b><br>Man invented language to satisfy his deep need to complain. &#x2014;Lily Tomlin<br><br><b>Complain:</b> (verb) 1: to express grief, pain, or discontent 2: to make a formal accusation or charge &#x2014;The Merriam&#x2013;Webster Dictionary<br>There are four stages to become competent at anything. In becoming a Complaint Free person, you will go through each of them and, sorry, you can&#x2019;t skip steps. You can&#x2019;t jump over them and effect lasting change. Some of the stages last longer than others. Everyone&#x2019;s experience with them varies. You might soar through one stage and then become stuck in another for a long time, but if you stay with it you will master this skill.<br><b>VOICES<br></b>Like most of the other folks who took up the Complaint free challenge, I quickly discovered exactly how many of the words I spoke in daily interactions were complaints. For the first time, I really heard myself when I vented about work, whined about my aches and pains, bemoaned political and world issues, and complained about the weather. What a shock to realize how many of my words held negative energy&#x2013;and I considered myself such a positive person! &#x2014;Marty Pointer, Kansas City, MO<br>The four stages to competency are:<br>1. Unconscious Incompetence<br>2. Conscious Incompetence<br>3. Conscious Competence<br>4. Unconscious Competence<br><br>In &#x201c;On a Distant Prospect of Eton College,&#x201d; Thomas Gray gave us the saying &#x201c;ignorance is bliss.&#x201d; As you become a Complaint Free person, you begin in the bliss of ignorance, move through the turmoil of transformation, and arrive at true bliss. Right now, you are in the Unconscious Incompetence stage. You are unconscious about your being incompetent. You don&#x2019;t realize (are unconscious) as to how much you complain (are incompetent).<br><br>Unconscious Incompetence is as much a state of being as a stage of competency. This is where we all begin. In Unconscious Incompetence you are pure potential, ready to create great things for yourself. There are exciting new vistas about to be explored. All you have to do is be willing to go through the remaining steps.<br><br>Many people are an &#x201c;ouch!&#x201d; looking for a hurt. If you cry &#x201c;ouch,&#x201d; the hurt will show up. If you complain, you&#x2019;ll receive more to complain about. It&#x2019;s the Law of Attraction in action. As you complete these stages, as you leave complaining behind, as you are no longer an &#x201c;ouch&#x201d; looking for a hurt, your life will unfold for you like a beautiful spring flower.<br><br>One of the questions I&#x2019;m often asked is &#x201c;Can I never complain...ever!?&#x201d; To which I answer, &#x201c;Of course you can complain.&#x201d; I say this for two reasons: <br><br>1. I&#x2019;m not out to tell you or anyone else what to do. If I were, I&#x2019;d be trying to change you, and that means I&#x2019;m focusing on something about you I don&#x2019;t like. I&#x2019;d be expressing discontent about you and, by inference, complaining. So you can do whatever you want. It&#x2019;s your choice.<br><br>2. Sometimes it makes sense to complain. <br><br>Now, before you feel you&#x2019;ve found your loophole in number 2 above, consider that word &#x201c;sometimes&#x201d; and remember that I and many, many people have gone three consecutive weeks&#x2013;that&#x2019;s 21 days, or 504 hours in a row&#x2013;without complaining at all. No complaints, zero, I Complain Therefore I Am 25 zip! When it comes to complaining, &#x201c;sometimes&#x201d; means &#x201c;not very often at all.&#x201d; Complaining should happen infrequently; criticism and gossip, never. If we are honest with ourselves, life events that lead us to legitimately complain (express grief, pain, or discontent) are exceedingly rare. Most of the complaining we do is just a lot of &#x201c;ear pollution&#x201d; detrimental to our happiness and well-being.<br><br>Check yourself. When you complain (express grief, pain, or discontent), is the cause severe? Are you complaining frequently? Has it been a month or more since you complained? If you&#x2019;re complaining more than once a month, you might just be giving in to habitual griping, which doesn&#x2019;t serve you. You&#x2019;re an &#x201c;ouch&#x201d; looking for a hurt.<br><br>To be a happy person who has mastered your thoughts and has begun creating your life by design, you need a very, very high threshold of what leads you to express grief, pain, and discontent. The next time you&#x2019;re about to complain about something, ask yourself how the situation stacks up to something that happened to me a few years ago. <br><br>I was sitting in my office preparing a lesson. The home we lived in at the time was located at a sharp bend in the road. Drivers had to slow down to make the curve, and just 200 yards past our house the city road became a county highway and the speed limit changed from 25 mph to 55 mph. As a result, we lived on an acceleration/deceleration lane. If it weren&#x2019;t for the curve in the road, our home would have been in a very dangerous place. It was a warm spring afternoon and the lace curtains flapped softly in the breeze from the open windows. Suddenly, I heard a strange sound. There was a loud thud, followed by a scream. It wasn&#x2019;t the scream of a person, but rather that of an animal. Every animal, just like every person, has a unique voice, and I knew this voice well. It was our long-haired golden retriever, Ginger. Normally, we don&#x2019;t think of dogs screaming. Barking, howling, whimpering&#x2014;yes; but screaming is something we rarely hear. But that&#x2019;s exactly what Ginger was doing. She had been hit, and she lay in the road shrieking with pain not twenty feet outside my window. I shouted and ran through the living room and out the front door, followed by my wife, Gail, and my daughter, Lia. Lia was six at the time.<br><br>As we approached Ginger, we could tell she was badly hurt. She was using her front legs to try to stand, but her hind legs did not seem to be helping. Again and again she yowled in pain. Neighbors poured from their homes to see what was causing the commotion. Lia just kept saying her name, &#x201c;Ginger...Ginger...,&#x201d; as the tears flowed down her cheeks and wet her shirt.<br><br>I looked around for the driver who had hit Ginger but saw no one. Then I looked up the hill that marked the line between city road and county road and saw a truck, towing a trailer, cresting the hill and accelerating past 55 mph. Even though our dog lay there in agony, my wife stood in shock, and my daughter cried piteously, I was consumed with confronting the person who had hit Ginger. &#x201c;How could anyone do this and just drive off?!&#x201d; I thought. &#x201c;He was just coming around the curve...surely he saw her, surely he knew what happened!&#x201d;<br><br>Abandoning my family in the midst of their pain and confusion, I jumped into my car and spun out of the driveway, leaving a plume of dust and gravel. Sixty, 75, 83 miles per hour along the gravel-and-dirt road in pursuit of the person who had hit Lia&#x2019;s dog and left without so much as facing us. I was going so fast on the uncertain surface that my car began to feel as if it were floating tenuously above the ground. In that moment, I calmed myself enough to realize that if I were killed while driving, it would be even harder on Gail and Lia than Ginger&#x2019;s having been hurt. I slowed down just enough to control my car as the distance between me and other driver closed.<br><br>Turning into his driveway and still not realizing I was after him, the man stepped from his truck in a torn shirt and oily jeans. I skidded in behind him and jumped from my car, screaming, &#x201c;You hit my dog!!!&#x201d; The man turned and looked at me as if I were speaking a foreign language. With blood raging in my ears, I wasn&#x2019;t sure I heard him correctly when he said, &#x201c;I know I hit your dog...What are you going to do about it?&#x201d; After regaining my connection with reality, I shot back, &#x201c;WHAT?!? What did you say?!&#x201d; He smiled as if he were correcting an errant child and then said again, in slow, deliberate words, &#x201c;I know I hit your dog...Exactly what are you going to do about it?&#x201d;<br><br>I was blind with rage. In my mind I kept seeing Lia in my rearview mirror standing over Ginger and crying. &#x201c;Put up your hands,&#x201d; I yelled. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Put up your hands,&#x201d; I said again. &#x201c;Defend yourself...I&#x2019;m going to kill you!&#x201d; <br><br>A few moments before, reason had kept me from killing myself while driving in a white&#x2013;hot rage to find this guy. Now his dismissive and cavalier comment about having painfully wounded a pet I dearly loved had vanquished all reason. I had never been in a fight in my adult life. I didn&#x2019;t believe in fighting. I wasn&#x2019;t sure I knew how to fight. But I wanted to beat this man to death. In that moment, I didn&#x2019;t care if I ended up in prison. <br><br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t gonna fight you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And if you hit me, it&#x2019;s assault, mister.&#x201d; My arms raised, my fists clinched tight as diamonds, I stood there dumbfounded. &#x201c;Fight me!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; he said, smiling through his remaining teeth, &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t gonna do no such thing.&#x201d; He turned his back and slowly walked away. I stood there shaking, anger poisoning my blood.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t remember driving back to my family. I don&#x2019;t remember lifting Ginger up and taking her to the vet. I do remember the way she smelled the last time I held her and the way she whimpered softly as the vet&#x2019;s needle ended her suffering. &#x201c;How could a person do such a thing?&#x201d; I asked myself repeatedly.<br><br>Days later, the man&#x2019;s jagged smile still haunted me as I tried to sleep. His &#x201c;What are you going to do about it?&#x201d; rang in my ears. I visualized exactly what I would have done to him had we fought. In my visions I was a superhero destroying an evil villain. Sometimes, I imagined I had a baseball bat or other weapon and was hurting him, hurting him as badly as he had hurt me, my wife, my daughter, and Ginger.<br><br>On the third night of unsuccessful attempts to sleep, I got up and began to write in my journal. After spilling out my grief, pain, and discontent for nearly an hour, I wrote something surprising: &#x201c;Those who hurt are hurting.&#x201d; Taking in my words as if they were from someone else, I wondered aloud, &#x201c;What?&#x201d; Again I wrote, &#x201c;Those who hurt are hurting.&#x201d; I sat back, brooding in my chair, and listened to the spring peepers and the crickets celebrating the night. &#x201c;Those who hurt are hurting? How could that apply to this guy?&#x201d; <br><br>As I thought more about it, I began to understand. A person who could so easily hurt a treasured family pet must not know the love of companion animals as we do. A person who can drive away as a young child folds into tears could not know the love of a young child. A man who cannot apologize for spearing a family&#x2019;s heart must have had his heart speared many, many times. This man was the real victim in this story. Truly he had acted as a villain, but it came as a result of the depth of pain within him.<br><br>I sat a long time, letting this all sink in. Every time I began to feel angry at him and the pain he caused, I thought of the pain this man must live with on a daily basis. In time, I switched off the light, went to bed, and slept soundly.<br><br><b>Complain</b>: to express grief, pain, or discontent.<br><br>During this experience, I felt <b>grief</b>. Ginger had shown up five years ago at our home in rural South Carolina. Several dogs had come to our home wanting to stay, but Gibson, our other dog, always ran them off. For some reason, he let Ginger stay. There was something special about Ginger. We presumed from her demeanor that she had been abused prior to coming to us. And, because she especially shied away from me, it was probably a man who had hurt her. After a year or so, she had begun to tentatively trust me. And in the remaining years, she had become a true friend. I deeply grieved her passing.<br><br>I certainly felt <b>pain</b>, real emotional pain that tore at my soul. Those of us with children know that we would rather endure any pain than have our children do so. And the pain my Lia was going through redoubled my own. <br><br>I felt <b>discontent</b>. I felt torn for not having thrashed the guy as well as for having considered acting violently in the first place. I felt ashamed for having walked away from him and equally ashamed for having chased after him in the first place.<br><br>Grief. Pain. Discontent.<br><br>When this man hit Ginger, it was appropriate for me to have felt and to have expressed each of these. You may have experienced something equally difficult at some time in your life. Fortunately, such traumatic events are rare. Similarly, complaining (expressing grief, pain, or discontent) should be rare.<br><br>But for most of us, our complaints are not sourced by such deeply painful experiences. Rather, we&#x2019;re the character in the Joe Walsh song &#x201c;Life&#x2019;s Been Good&#x201d;&#x2014;we can&#x2019;t complain, but sometimes we still do. Things are not really bad enough to warrant expressing grief, pain, or discontent, but complaining is our default setting. It&#x2019;s what we do.<br><br>Ignorance is bliss. Prior to beginning your trek down the path to becoming a Complaint Free person, you were probably blissfully unaware as to how much you complain and the damaging effect of your complaints on your life. For many of us, griping about the weather, our spouse, our work, our bodies, our friends, our jobs, the economy, other drivers, our country, or whatever we are thinking about is something we do dozens of times each and every day. Yet few of us realize how often we complain.<br><br>The words come out of our mouths, so our ears must hear them. But, for some reason, they don&#x2019;t register as complaints. Complaining can be likened to bad breath. We notice it when it comes out of someone else&#x2019;s mouth, but not when it comes from our own.<br><br>Chances are you complain a lot more than you think. And now that you&#x2019;ve accepted the 21&#x2013;day challenge to become complaint free, you have begun to notice it. You start moving the bracelet from wrist to wrist, and you realize how much you kvetch (Yiddish for &#x201c;complain&#x201d;&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not Jewish, but I really like the word).<br><br>Up until this point, you would probably have said, honestly, that you don&#x2019;t complain&#x2014;much, anyway. Certainly, you think that you only complain when something is legitimately bothering you. The next time you&#x2019;re tempted to justify your complaining, remember Ginger&#x2019;s story and ask yourself if what you&#x2019;re going through is that bad. Then resolve to keep your pledge to not complain.</p><h2>Peter and the Shadow Thieves (Peter and the Starcatchers, 2)</h2><p><br>In this riveting and adventure-packed follow-up to <i>Peter and the Starcatchers</i>, we discover Peter leaving the relative safety of Mollusk Island-along with his trusted companion Tinker Bell-for the cold, damp streets of London. On a difficult journey across the sea, he and Tink discover the dark and deadly, slithering part-man/part-creature Lord Ombra. It seems that the dreaded Ombra has a variety of mysterious powers including the ability to make shadows disappear. When Peter reaches London, he sets out to find the indomitable Molly. Together they must combat Ombra's terrible forces to both protect the Starcatchers and the treasured starstuff and most importantly to rescue Molly's mother from the clutches of evil. Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson have done it again-written a compulsively readable, impossible-to-put-down tale that will delight readers of all ages.</p><p><br>Dave Barry is a Pulitzer Prize - winning author of more than a dozen books, including <em>Dave Barry's Money Secrets; Dave Barry's Complete Guide to Guys</em>; <em>Dave Barry Slept Here</em>; <em>Big Trouble</em>; and <em>Dave Barry Hits Below the Beltway</em>. Along with Ridley Pearson, he is the co-author of <em>Peter and the Starcatchers, Peter and the Shadow Thieves, Escape from the Carnivale, </em><em>and </em><em>Cave of the Dark Wind.</em> Ridley Pearson is the best-selling author of eighteen novels, including <em>The Kingdom Keepers;Cut and Run</em>; <em>The Body of David Hayes</em>; <em>The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer</em>; <em>Beyond Recognition</em>; <em>Parallel Lies</em>; and <em>No Witnesses</em>. He was the first American to be awarded the Raymond Chandler/Fulbright Fellowship in Detective Fiction at Oxford University. <br><br> <br>Greg Call studied graphic design at the Colorado Institute of Art in Denver. After graduating in 1983, he worked as an Art Director at the Colorado Institute of Art until the desire to do more illustrative work found him in Pasadena, California, attending The Art Center College of Design. Upon graduation in 1988, he began working freelance for clients in music, entertainment, and publishing. Greg has been recognized for his work repeatedly, including awards from the Society of Illustrators and Addy awards among others.Grade 4-7&#x2013;In this sequel to <i>Peter and the Starcatchers</i> (Hyperion, 2004), trouble arrives at Mollusk Island (otherwise known as Never Land) in the form of a ship filled with nefarious characters searching for the trunk of starstuff that the Starcatchers spirited away in the first book. When the bad guys, led by nonhuman Lord Ombra, learn that it is in London, they sail off in pursuit, and it takes the combined efforts of Peter, Tinker Bell, and Peter's friend Molly's Starcatcher family to ensure that it is returned to outer space before Lord Ombra can use it to rule the world. Kids won't have to have read the first book to dive headfirst into this one; it is filled with enough rollicking, death-defying adventure to satisfy anyone. Readers familiar with James Barrie's <i>Peter Pan</i> (or even the Disney animated version) will immediately recognize and enjoy familiar characters, but it is when the action switches to London that the plot really starts to sizzle. Breathless chases and near-death experiences are spiced with a miasma of Dickensian squalor, creating scenes that are rich in color and action if short on in-depth characterization. This should appeal to fantasy and adventure fans alike.<i>&#x2013;Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

How deep does the sun go when it sinks into the sea?&#x201d;<br> The unexpected arrival of a large ship&#x2014;adorned with a magnificent masthead of a stag&#x2019;s tree-like<br> antlers&#x2014;offers Marco the chance to seek out the answers his fellow foxes can&#x2019;t provide.

Russet-furred Marco wonders about everything. His fellow foxes care mainly about dinner. When a great, antlered wooden ship, captained by a deer named Sylvia, docks in the harbor, Marco goes down to see it. Intrigued by the possibility of finding other foxes who share his curiosity, Marco decides to set sail, as do an adventurous flock of pigeons led by Victor, pictured as a one-legged bird in a bandanna. While they struggle a bit with the unfamiliar tasks and are beset by the typical dangers that sailors face, Marco, Sylvia, and Victor each contribute to the success of their journey. In the mostly dreamy, delicate pen-and-pencil illustrations, colored digitally, Marco the fox and the other animals are shown as sapient but not completely anthropomorphized. The antlered ship is delightfully detailed and decorated, the pirates our heroes encounter are appropriately toothy and threatening (even the cutlass-wielding mouse), and the sepia-colored maps on the endpapers feature deliciously evocative names. The old-fashioned appearance of the Fans' artwork perfectly suits Slater's contemplative, musing tone. While the ending is hardly a surprise, it feels right, true, and not the least bit clich�d. A beautifully composed package filled with whimsy and wisdom&#x2014;the story of this unique vessel will inspire and entertain thoughtful listeners. (Picture book. 4-7) Author: Kirkus, STARRED REVIEW Source: 7/15/17<br><br>Marco, a fox, thirsts to know everything: &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t trees ever talk? How deep does the sun go when it sinks into the sea?&#x201d; A ship appears off the coast of Marco&#x2019;s forest. It&#x2019;s crewed by deer (they&#x2019;re poor sailors, they admit), and its figurehead is a stag with a massive set of antlers. Together with a flock of pigeons, Marco embarks on a nautical adventure in hopes of locating foxes who can answer his questions. The sailors encounter storms, dangerous rocks, and pirates before finding the island refuge they seek. In spreads that evoke seafaring motifs from the Odyssey to Treasure Island, the Fan brothers (The Night Gardener) lavish care on every delicate detail, from the ship&#x2019;s rigging to the foam on the waves. Breathtaking seascapes alternate with cozy scenes below decks as predators and prey huddle peaceably. Slater (Escargot) creates a story to lose oneself in, an adventure packed with risk and possibility. The ship becomes a community, and Marco and his questions part of its journey. Author: Publishers Weekly *STARRED REVIEW Source: July 24, 2017<br><br>A fox sets sail in search of answers to questions about life, the universe, and everything in this picture book fantasy. Marco the fox wonders about many things, but the other foxes are more concerned with chicken soup than with philosophy. When an antlered ship appears, captained by deer traveling to an island of &#x201c;tall, sweet grass and short, sweet trees,&#x201d; Marco seizes the opportunity to seek out other foxes who may have answers. The crew sails across treacherous seas, triumphing over sharp rocks and fierce pirates before arriving safely at Sweet Tree Island. Alas, there are no foxes to be found, and Marco&#x2019;s travels have only yielded more questions. Yet, he also has new friends and the chance for further adventures&#x2013;perhaps that is enough. Slater&#x2019;s adventure narrative is an epic journey with a classic feel, perfectly scaled for a picture-book audience. The straightforward text is lyrical, rhythmic, and begs to be read aloud. Graphite-and-pen illustrations by the Fan Brothers depict expressive, realistically drawn animals sporting the occasional hat or bandanna. As the distinctive prow of the antlered ship sails through ethereal seascapes, young audiences can follow its path through the detailed maps included on the endpapers.

He finds he must test his mettle and powers of command to emerge a local hero&#x2014;or the deadest of dupes.</p><p>Fans often feel uneasy when the creator of a popular character ventures into new turf, and sometimes their trepidation is justified. But readers of Robert B. Parker's immensely popular Spenser series can breathe a sigh of relief: while <i>Night Passage</i> doesn't feature Spenser, his usual gang of associates, or a Boston setting, it's vintage Parker--fast, witty, suspenseful, and engaging. Told in short, crisp chapters, it's the story of Jesse Stone, a 34-year-old ex-cop who just lost his L.A. policeman's job and his marriage due to a drinking problem. The book opens as Stone leaves California for his new job as chief of police in the picturesque town of Paradise, Massachusetts. <p> But Paradise isn't as placid as it seems--in fact, it's a festering mass of petty corruption, right-wing militia, sexual scandal, and bad guys who favor strong-arm tactics. <i>Night Passage</i> boasts a delicious, classic setup: the lone lawman, new in town, must make his stand to clean the place up. Stone has been picked for the job because the town fathers figured he'd be weak and malleable; as he gradually pulls himself together, it turns out they have a surprise in store. Stone's qualities may remind you of Spenser's--he's taciturn, fearless, good-looking, and compassionate--and in the end the plot's pleasing complexities get resolved a bit simply. But Robert B. Parker is in fine form in <i>Night Passage,</i> with his smart-aleck wit under control and his prose at its economical best. Spenser fans and Parker neophytes alike will find plenty to enjoy here. And the setting is, after all, not far from Boston--dare we hope for a Spenser-Stone meeting in future books?</p>The author of two dozen Spenser novels as well as numerous other works of fiction, Robert B. Parker is no stranger to either critical or popular acclaim. With his hallmark sharp wit and taut action, Parker has created in the Spenser series the standard against which all contemporary detective novels are measured, and a character considered the paragon of private eyes. In <i>Night Passage,</i> Parker sets the bar even higher, with the introduction of Jesse Stone, a hero cut from different cloth.<br><br>After a busted marriage kicks his drinking problem into overdrive and the LAPD unceremoniously dumps him, the thirty-five-year-old Stone's future looks bleak.

They sold dinners in their neighborhoods.</i><br><i>As the boycotters walked and walked, Georgia cooked and cooked. </i><br><br>Georgia Gilmore was a cook at the National Lunch Company in Montgomery, Alabama. When the bus boycotts broke out in Montgomery after Rosa Parks was arrested, Georgia knew just what to do. She organized a group of women who cooked and baked to fund-raise for gas and cars to help sustain the boycott. Called the Club from Nowhere, Georgia was the only person who knew who baked and bought the food, and she said the money came from "nowhere" to anyone who asked. When Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested for his role in the boycott, Georgia testified on his behalf, and her home became a meeting place for civil rights leaders. This picture book highlights a hidden figure of the civil rights movement who fueled the bus boycotts and demonstrated that one person can make a real change in her community and beyond.

For those who've realized there are areas of life-your normal, everyday, busy life-where you disbelieve God, His goodness and His gospel.

The <i>Gospel Fluency Handbook</i> is designed to help you and your group become fluent in the gospel-in other words, to help you move from unbelief to belief. The discussions and exercises in this 8-week interactive handbook provide a step-by-step immersion of your mind, heart, soul, and life in the gospel. Each week follows a simple format: three sets of personal Readings and Reflections, a weekly guide for Group Discussion and Exercises that will lead to becoming a more gospel-fluent people.

Little did he know he had just met the muse that would determine the course of his life. Chandoha turned his lens on his new feline friend&#x2015;which he named Loco&#x2015;and was so inspired by the results that he started photographing kittens from a local shelter. These images marked the start of an extraordinary career that would span seven decades.</p><p>Long before the Internet and #catsofinstagram, Chandoha was enrapturing the public with his fuzzy subjects. From advertisements to greetings cards, jigsaw puzzles to pet-food packaging, his images combined a genuine affection for the creatures, a strong work ethic, and flawless technique. Chandoha&#x2019;s trademark glamorous lighting, which made each cat&#x2019;s fur stand out in sharp relief, would define the visual vocabulary of animal portraiture for generations and inspire such masters as Andy Warhol, who took cues from Chandoha&#x2019;s charming portraits in his illustrated cat book.Cats leaps into the archives of this genre-defining artist, spanning color studio and environmental portraits, black-and-white street photography, images from vintage cat shows, tender pictures that combine his children with cats and more.

Muncha! Muncha!</i>PreS-Gr 2-On a cold winter day as a mean wind blows and icicles hang from windowsills, Pauline and her younger brother, John-John, decide to have a lemonade stand. Gathering all their quarters (Pauline's favorite coins), they buy their supplies and make lemonade, limeade, and lemon-limeade. On their mostly empty street with the snow falling, they attract a few customers-Harvey walking his three dogs, Mrs. Gordon and her twins, Heather and Aidan strolling arm in arm, and five manicurists in puffy coats. Despite their advertising, entertainment, decorations, and sales, the children make only four dollars, which is less than the cost of their supplies but enough for two Popsicles. Karas's illustrations, rendered with brush and walnut ink in sepia tones, capture the half-light of an overcast winter day as the children, bundled in warm clothes, tend their stand and count their earnings. A last page, called "Pauline Explains Money to John-John," shows both fronts and backs of different coins and explains their worth. This quirky tale is a boon for young entrepreneurs, who will enjoy looking at the humorous details in the pictures as much as working out the math after each sale.

Dav was so disruptive in class that his teachers made him sit out in the hall every day. Luckily, Dav loved to draw and make up stories, so he spent his time in the hallway creating his own original comic books. In the second grade, Dav Pilkey created a comic book about a superhero named Captain Underpants. His teacher ripped it up and told him he couldn&#x2019;t spend the rest of his life making silly books. Fortunately, Dav was not a very good listener. Dav has gone on to create award-winning and bestselling books for children. His Captain Underpants series has more than 80 million copies in print worldwide and has been translated into more than 28 languages. In 2017, DreamWorks Animation brought the character to the silver screen in the feature film adaptation <i>Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie</i>, and Netflix is now streaming <i>The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants</i> TV show.

Stay cool.</em></p><p>No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it&#x2019;s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies&#x2014;before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe.</p><p>Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she&#x2019;s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakob&#x2019;s dismay, Harper wants to live&#x2014;at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.</p><p>Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squads&#x2014;armed, self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore. But Harper isn&#x2019;t as alone as she fears: a mysterious and compelling stranger she briefly met at the hospital, a man in a dirty yellow fire fighter&#x2019;s jacket, carrying a hooked iron bar, straddles the abyss between insanity and death. Known as The Fireman, he strolls the ruins of New Hampshire, a madman afflicted with Dragonscale who has learned to control the fire within himself, using it as a shield to protect the hunted . . . and as a weapon to avenge the wronged.</p><p>In the desperate season to come, as the world burns out of control, Harper must learn the Fireman&#x2019;s secrets before her life&#x2014;and that of her unborn child&#x2014;goes up in smoke.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2016:</strong> I admit, when I hit a saggy part in a story, I do skip ahead to see if the plot will pick up again. At no point in Joe Hill&#x2019;s doorstop-weight novel did I have that urge, for each and every page had me entranced. Set in New Hampshire right about now, <em>The Fireman</em> opens with a man spontaneously combusting outside the office of school nurse Harper Grayson. He&#x2019;s not the first victim of <em>Draco incendia trychophyton</em>, the spore responsible for this transformation, but he&#x2019;s the signal that Dragonscale has spread to Harper&#x2019;s small town. It also spreads to Harper soon after she realizes she&#x2019;s pregnant. Highly contagious and 100 percent fatal, Dragonscale soon plunges the world into chaos. (An oddly affective moment is when Harper logs onto Google and finds, instead of the search engine, the words &#x201c;Goodby.&#x201d;) But Hill smartly focuses on Harper and her attempts at survival, keeping the stakes small but extremely personal as the uninfected hunt down and murder the infected, supposedly to protect the rest of the town but really to indulge in sociopathic tendencies now unleashed. <em>The Fireman</em> starts with a hot burn, simmers as Harper joins a group of infected hiding in a summer camp, and then heats up again as the near-utopian community ruptures. Hill weaves questions about the power of leadership, group-think, love, catastrophe, and family into the plot. His smartest move is to give no clear-cut answers to these questions, making <em>The Fireman</em> more substantial and real than a typical apocalyptic thriller. And his humdinger of an ending provides just the right closure. <em>--Adrian Liang</em><p>A terrifying new plague is striking cities one by one.

Theology is considered the business of pastors and professors, while worship is the business of musicians and rock stars.<br><br>But a new wave of young worship leaders is hungry for something different, the desire to think not just pragmatically (sound, charts, guitars) but theologically (the gospel, justice, pastoral ministry) about worship. Likewise, pastors and churches increasingly desire to be led by thoughtful worship leaders who combine doxology and theology.<br><br><i>Doxology and Theology</i> is a resource by worship leaders for worship leaders that clearly articulates how these two pieces join together. Contributions from eleven respected worship leaders around the country including Matt Papa (Summit Church, Raleigh-Durham), Aaron Keyes (Grace Church, Atlanta), Michael Bleecker (The Village Church, Dallas), and Zac Hicks (Cherry Creek Presbyterian Church, Denver) unite worship with themes of mission, disciple-making, the Word of God, the Trinity, family, and more.</p><p><b>Matt Boswell&nbsp;</b>is the worship pastor at Providence Church in Frisco, Texas.

This new assessment of a pivotal time in the formation of what was to become the United States offers thought-provoking insights into the English influence on the development of the "peculiar institution."</p></p><p>Though there was no tradition of slavery in England, it was the norm throughout British colonies in North America and the Caribbean by the end of the 17th century. Historian Betty Wood examines the reasons for its spread in this scholarly, but readable, book. She begins by noting that the British believed slavery was appropriate for non-Christian foreigners, and that Africans belonged to that category. Once the need for cheap labor in the Americas became apparent, planters turned to Africa, and slavery, which had once seemed unthinkable, spread throughout the colonies in an unholy alliance of these two factors--racism and economics.Though the English did not begin their colonization of the New World with the intention of enslaving anyone, by the end of the seventeenth century chattel slavery existed in each of England&#39;s American colonies. Why? And why did the English enslave West Africans rather than native Americans or Europeans? Historians have usually stressed either racial ideology or determining economic and demographic factors, but Betty Wood suggests that a more complex rationale was at work. In this important new analysis, Wood begins by exploring the meanings of freedom and bondage in sixteenth-century English thought and the ideas that men and women of Tudor England had about Africans and native Americans. She studies their prejudices against non-Christians, their responses to models of slavery in the Spanish and French colonies, and their assessment of their own labor shortages, and in the light of these various factors interprets the decision of the English to resort to slave labor in the colonies. She then follows the spread of slavery through the seventeenth century, from the Caribbean and the Carolinas to Virginia tobacco country and finally among the Puritans and Quakers farther north.</p><h2>Four Great Tragedies: Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, and Romeo and Juliet (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)</h2><p>Among the most studied, most read, and most admired works in world literature, the tragedies of Shakespeare constitute a body of work unrivaled in dramatic brilliance, beauty of language, and profundity of thought. This convenient and affordable volume&#x2014;ideal for students and all lovers of literature&#x2014;features four of the playwright&#x2019;s greatest works: <i>Hamlet,</i> the revenge drama centering on the introspective Prince of Denmark&#x2014;one of literature's most discussed and contentious characters, and the role that every actor longs to play; <i>Macbeth,</i> otherwise known as "The Scottish Play," concerning a nobleman's overweening ambition; <i>Othello,</i> in which a gallant soldier and loving husband is undone by jealousy; and <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> the timeless tale of the young lovers whose names are synonymous with star-crossed romance.</p><p><p>"He was not of an age, but for all time," declared Ben Jonson of his contemporary William Shakespeare (1564&#x2013;1616). Jonson's praise is especially prescient, since at the turn of the 17th century Shakespeare was but one of many popular London playwrights and none of his dramas were printed in his lifetime. The reason so many of his works survive is because two of his actor friends, with the assistance of Jonson, assembled and published the First Folio edition of 1623.</p></p><h2>Physics: Concepts &amp; Connections (4th Edition)</h2><p><p> In this briefer, streamlined revision, Art Hobson once again makes physics relevant and interesting for the casual reader. He introduces modern physics early on, maintaining the book&#x2019;s focus on the cultural and social context of physics. Updates and extensively revises chapters on relativity. Provides a more modern, straightforward treatment of quantum physics. Includes new and updated societal topics, such as nuclear terrorism. Adds new and revised &#x201c;How Do We Know&#x201d; subsections that emphasize the process of science. A reader-friendly reference for anyone interested in learning more about physics and how it affects our lives.</p></p><p>This book approaches physics as a human endeavor, in philosophical and social context. Not a watered-down version of the standard technical texts, this is a true liberal arts physics textbook that connects physics with its cultural aspects and balances coverage of Newtonian and modern physics.<p><b>What is the connection between this painting and physics?</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In Marcel Duchamp&#x2019;s 1912 painting, we view a woman at several times during her descent of a staircase, very much like Einstein&#x2019;s spacetime diagrams. The woman&#x2019;s features are uncertain, abstract, like a blurred photographic time exposure of a moving figure. </p> <p>Historians believe it was no coincidence that abstract art and modern physics both originated during 1900- 1914. Early 20th century cubist painters such as Duchamp and Pablo Picasso experienced the same currents of thought that influenced the theory of relativity and the origins of quantum physics. Albert Einstein&#x2019;s unification of space and time into a single abstract &#x201c;spacetime&#x201d; with time as the fourth dimension was similar to Picasso&#x2019;s and Duchamp&#x2019;s portrayal of reality as abstract volumes or &#x201c;cubes&#x201d; viewed from several perspectives and times simultaneously. </p> <p>Such connections between art and science shouldn&#x2019;t be viewed from a causal perspective. It&#x2019;s not as though Duchamp decided to inject relativity or quantum physics into his paintings. Instead, new ideas about space, time, and determinism were in the air, and perspective people such as Einstein, Picasso, and Duchamp reflected these ideas in their own creations. </p><b> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>What professors are saying:</p></b> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;This is close to ideal for true liberal arts students, especially those who want to make the world better, or at least resist unhealthy trends, and who want to argue about the things they care about. The author has a passion for relevance and environmental issues.&#x201d;</p> <p><b>-Doanld Franceshetti, University of Memphis</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hobson&#x2019;s textbook is both well named and well constructed. Its coverage of modern physics presents a conceptual grasp of some of the most exciting developments in the physics of our day.&#x201d; </p> <p><b>-Leon M.

He does an excellent job of developing his themes of the scientific process, the social context of physics, energy, and the significance of post-Newtonian physics.&#x201d;</p> <p><b>-Louis Schwartzkopf , Minnesota State University</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;It has the best (and the most modern) discussion of quantum mechanics that I&#x2019;ve ever seen-much clearer than some of the famous writers.&#x201d;</p> <p><b>- Marc Sher, William and Mary</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;When I examined the first edition of Hobson&#x2019;s <i>Physics Concepts and Connections, </i>I thought that it was the best of many physics texts for non-scientist that I had seen, and the later editions have further improvements over the first. He presents a remarkably comprehensive survey of the physical world with lucidity, accuracy, and- above all- fascination. Hobson unforgettably reminds his readers of the social implications of physics and the inseparability of knowledge and values.&#x201d;</p><b> <p>&nbsp;- Abner Shimon, Boston University</p></b></p><h2>Art and Architecture in Italy, 1600-1750, Volumes 1-3: Fourth Edition (The Yale University Press Pelican History)</h2><p>This classic survey of Italian Baroque art and architecture focuses on the arts in every center between Venice and Sicily in the early, high, and late Baroque periods.

The scent of snow suffuses Wind Mother's breath. While my fingers gouge the rock, I gaze up at the deep blue thunderheads standing like fortresses above the chestnuts and sycamores that ring the meadow. Dusk's purple halo has faded to nothingness, leaving the white tree trunks steel gray, the dry grasses silver.The old wolf who always strides at my side lifts his gray muzzle and scents the air, returning me to the acrid odor of burning longhouses. The scent is strong, mixing eerily with the cries of the wounded who scatter the battlefield. I sink against the boulder, hoping that, for the moment, shadows hide me from my warriors.The other members of the war party have retreated to the nearby meadow to cook supper and tell stories, each trying--as I am--to forget the horror that surrounds him. My thoughts drift and, as always, return to her.<i>... long naked legs whispering through the spring grass ... pearl-colored Cloud People scudding overhead. Struggling for air, for more of her. Floating weightlessly through the deep wildflower-scented afternoons, her lips upon my body like fire.</i>I'm shaking. I cast a glance over my shoulder to make certain no one iswatching me. I am a deputy war chief. I cannot afford weakness. Dozens of campfires glitter. Here and there, men laugh, and their breath condenses in the cold air and glides across the fire-dyed meadow.Beyond the warriors, near the river, the captives sit roped together, shivering, gazing around with wide, stunned eyes. Four women and eleven children. I have counted the children over and over. In the morning they will be marched off to alien villages, adopted into strange new clans, or killed, as suits the whims of the matrons. The sight always sickens me. As a boy, my village was attacked and I was captured. I know from the inside what it feels like ... and the utter despair still haunts me. To this day, I refuse to take captives, which does not endear me to the clan matrons of the Standing Stone People. Many times my warriors have voted me war chief, but the matrons refuse to allow it. They say I am not ready.They are right.I clench my fists and turn my gaze to the burning village, where flames still leap through the charred husks of twelve longhouses. We arrived this afternoon. Well thought out, every possible permutation calculated and planned for by War Chief Deru, our victory required only three hands of time. Most of the villagers were still in their bedding hides, sick with the unknown fever that ravages the land. They barely put up a fight.On the canvas of my souls I see it all again: the assault, pouring the pine pitch at the base of the palisade, setting the fires, people fleeing in all directions, arrows cutting them down like blades of grass beneath finely flaked chert scythes.This is a Flint People village. Blessed gods, if they ever find out I was among the war party--if <i>she</i> ever finds out--my life will not be worth the price of a wooden bead. Even if the Flint matrons do not believe hunting me down is worth the lives it would cost--for I am a formidable warrior--she will be coming. She can't let me live, not after his. Not after the promises I made.<i>... I requicken in you the great soul of Dekanawida ... .</i>The dread emptiness that often assaults warriors when the battle is done filters through me. I lean more heavily against the boulder and concentrate on breathing, just breathing. Empty cadences of the river babbling over rocks penetrate the night.Only three moons ago, the Flint People were our allies. We fought together, lived together, protected each other's villages from the marauding Mountain People who sought to kill us all and take our lands. When the matrons ordered this attack, I was stunned, as were many, including War Chief Deru. Our people have suffered many losses in the ongoing war, and each has to be replaced. Every warrior understands that this is accomplishedthrough adoption. Captives are taken and marched home, the best selected, and put in line for the Requickening Ceremony. During the ritual, the souls of lost loved ones are raised up and transferred to the living body of the captive, along with the name of the deceased. When relatives have their families back, it eases their grief, and restores the spiritual strength of the clan.I wipe my mouth with the back of my hand. When I lower it, I stop to stare at the blood that cakes my fingers. Some of the people who lived in this village were her relatives. Her clan.... S<i>unlight filtered through the scent of her hair. Flesh coming alive, the open lips that touch mine like an unslaked summer, the heart-wrenching safety of her arms enough to convince me to forsake my own people.</i>"Blessed gods, stop it," I murmur with hushed violence.When the war ends, perhaps ... But, no, that will never happen. Not after tonight. And the war isn't going to end. Great Grandmother Earth has been growing progressively colder and drier for longer than I have been alive, at least twenty-three summers, which means our corn, beans, and squash crops rarely mature. As a result we are forced to hunt and fish harder. After many summers of desperation, most of the deer are gone, the lakes fished out. The only solution is to take what we need from our enemies.Or so the matrons tell us.When I refused to obey the order to accompany this war party, High Matron Kittle called a special council meeting of the allied villages. What the council decided was law. "Alliances are quicksand, always shifting. You know that, Sky Messenger. We must all do our duties, including you. Don't you care about your people?"<i>" ... You're the only man I've ever trusted. From this time forward, you are one of my people. Her sudden embrace like wind ransacking the forest ... ears roar. Later, pawpaws baked in hot ashes ... happier than at any other time in my life ..."</i>Two men rise from their cook fire and stretch their tired muscles. Deerbone stilettos, war axes, and clubs bristle on their belts. Every man carries in his bosom the idea of the knife and axe. How can he even think of peace when the thrill of victory beckons?Someone makes a joke. Laughter erupts, but it is uneasy, filled with nerves and exhaustion.When a low growl rumbles in Gitchi's throat, I reach down and pat the old wolf's grey head. He is staring out at the battlefield, his yellow eyes bright, fixed on something I do not see. "It's all right, Gitchi. Everything is--"The words die in my throat. There, at the edge of the burning village, wreathed in blowing smoke, stands a dark wraith, his black buckskin cape flapping around his tall body. The ancient, tarnished copper beads that ring his collar flash blue in the firelight. He turns to gaze directly at me, and the hair at the nape of my neck prickles. His hood is pulled up. Inside, where his face should be, it is blacker than black, like a bottomless chasm.Gitchi whimpers.The figure looks one last time at the destroyed village, then turns away so gracefully I swear it is not tethered to the ground. It glides northward, toward the worst part of the battlefield.My gaze tracks it.The figure stops at the edge of the clearing where the cries of the wounded are unbearable. Soon, after my warriors have had suppers and drunk their fill of water, they will return here to dispatch those still alive and strip their corpses of valuables. For now, the field appears to be alive with gigantic beetles. Humped shapes crawl, topple, struggle up again. Probably trying to reach injured loved ones.The figure turns to stare at me expectantly. <i>What is it he wants me to ... ?</i>Flashes catch my eye. Curious, I walk away from the fires to see better.When I stand alone in the blackness, the blood seems to drain out of my body, leaving me ice cold and staring fixedly at the battlefield littered with dead. Lights rise from the corpses, hundreds of them. Some shoot away into the heavens and blend with the Path of Souls, the star road that the Flint People call the Road of Light. That shining path leads to the Land of the Dead. Others bounce around as though not sure where they are or what has happened.For a timeless moment, I cannot move.Exhausted men who've been living horror for moons often see things that are not there. I back away and shake myself. <i>It's the exhaustion, war fatigue.</i>Four bucks appear at the far edge of the clearing. As though they've absorbed the firelight, their thick coats flicker and their antler tips shine like points of flame.When the bucks trot out onto the battlefield and begin tossing their heads as they chase the lights, everything in me longs to cry out.The People of the Standing Stone believe that the souls of the dead must travel the sky road to reach the afterlife, but sometimes, especially after a long illness, souls become lost. The Spirit lights roam about in confusion, weeping. When the deer hear them, they run at them, catch them in their antlers, and throw them up into the heavens where the Spirits can see the Path of Souls and begin their journey to the Land of the Dead.A child sobs, jerking my attention back to the captives. I glance from them to the wandering souls of the dead and back. My veins are on fire.My Spirit Helper once told me that before a man crosses the bridge to the afterlife, he must discover what he's running from and why. My gaze rivets on a boy of perhaps eleven summers. His face is terror. It might as well be my own face--twelve sum...</p><h2>The Grapes of Wrath</h2><p>Tan buckram cloth covers with brown illustration across lower part of front cover. Second printing before publication. Dyed top page edge has wear. Some discoloration inside back cover along spine. 8x5.5 with 619 pp. Owners name in pencil on ffep.</p><p>When <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> was published in 1939, America, still recovering from the Great Depression, came face to face with itself in a startling, lyrical way. John Steinbeck gathered the country's recent shames and devastations--the Hoovervilles, the desperate, dirty children, the dissolution of kin, the oppressive labor conditions--in the Joad family. Then he set them down on a westward-running road, local dialect and all, for the world to acknowledge. For this marvel of observation and perception, he won the Pulitzer in 1940.<p> The prize must have come, at least in part, because alongside the poverty and dispossession, Steinbeck chronicled the Joads' refusal, even inability, to let go of their faltering but unmistakable hold on human dignity. Witnessing their degeneration from Oklahoma farmers to a diminished band of migrant workers is nothing short of crushing. The Joads lose family members to death and cowardice as they go, and are challenged by everything from weather to the authorities to the California locals themselves. As Tom Joad puts it: "They're a-workin' away at our spirits. They're a tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl like a whipped bitch. They tryin' to break us. Why, Jesus Christ, Ma, they comes a time when the on'y way a fella can keep his decency is by takin' a sock at a cop. They're workin' on our decency."</p><p> The point, though, is that decency remains intact, if somewhat battle-scarred, and this, as much as the depression and the plight of the "Okies," is a part of American history. When the California of their dreams proves to be less than edenic, Ma tells Tom: "You got to have patience. Why, Tom--us people will go on livin' when all them people is gone. Why, Tom, we're the people that live. They ain't gonna wipe us out. Why, we're the people--we go on." It's almost as if she's talking about the very novel she inhabits, for Steinbeck's characters, more than most literary creations, do go on. They continue, now as much as ever, to illuminate and humanize an era for generations of readers who, thankfully, have no experiential point of reference for understanding the depression. The book's final, haunting image of Rose of Sharon--Rosasharn, as they call her--the eldest Joad daughter, forcing the milk intended for her stillborn baby onto a starving stranger, is a lesson on the grandest scale. "'You got to,'" she says, simply. And so do we all. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>A heart-wrenching full-cast adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by John Steinbeck, starring Jeffrey Donovan and Shirley Knight. Set during the Great Depression, The Grapes of Wrath tells the powerful story of the Joad family's trek from the dust bowl of Oklahoma to the promise of a new life in California.

In this unique book Mrs. Chen supplies the key to the world of Chinese cuisine. Exquisite, subtle, different recipes are here, but this book provides much more than that. It shows how and where to shop, how to select meats and vegetables, how to buy and how to prepare. You will discover the correct way to make Chinese tea, prepare rice, and use chopsticks, and you will learn about the three great regional schools of cooking within China: Cantonese, Mandarin, and Szechwan. Mrs. Chen carefully explains, and demonstrates with illustrations when necessary, all the processes of preparing food the Chinese way. Her recipes are simple, clear, and flexible enough so that you can find substitutes for ingredients that may be hard to procure. As world-famous heart specialist Dr. Paul Dudley White points out in his foreword, &#34;Joyce Chen&#39;s recipes are commendable for several reasons. In the first place, they are a delight to the gourmet; secondly, they represent real Chinese cooking at its best; and thirdly, they are good for the health.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Lion Path: You Can Take It With You</h2><p>The Lion Path: You Can Take It With You</p><p></p><h2>Strange Stories for Strange Kids (Little Lit, Book 2)</h2><p><p>The second groundbreaking anthology from the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling team of Art Spiegelman and Francoise Mouly is here!

Just as with the previous Little Lit book, <i>Folklore &amp; Fairy Tale Funnies</i>, you'll find some of the most hilarious, intelligent, and diverse short comics around inside these pages: Maurice Sendak's omnivorous infant gobbles up everything in sight in "Cereal Baby Keller"; David Sedaris pairs up with Ian Falconer to define true cuteness; "Where's Waldo?" creator Martin Handford searches for old socks; Paul Auster (yes, <i>that</i> Paul Auster) and Jacques de Loustal's offering follows a man who's found he's disappeared; Crockett Johnson (<i>Harold and the Purple Crayon</i>) brings back the beginning of his classic '40s strip, "Barnaby" (a favorite of Duke Ellington and Dorothy Parker, among others); and Spiegelman himself takes on "The Several Selves of Selby Sheldrake."

Queensbury House, the home of Scotland's new rulers, falls in the middle of John Rebus' turf, keeping him busy with ceremonial tasks. That quickly changes, however, when a long-dead body is discovered in a Queensbury House fireplace, a homeless man throws himself off a bridge - leaving behind a suitcase full of cash - and an up-and-coming politician is found murdered. The links between the three deaths lead Rebus to a confrontation with one of Edinburgh's most notorious criminals, a man he thought he'd put in jail for life. Someone's going to make a lot of money out of Scotland's independence - and, as Rebus knows all too well, where there's big money at stake, darkness gathers.<br></p><p>Edinburgh police inspector John Rebus's obsession--rock &amp; roll--seems odd for a man whose dark, depressed side is so central to his character, but Ian Rankin always manages to work it gracefully into his noirish novels featuring Rebus. In <i>Set in Darkness</i>, Rebus has a fling with Lorna Grieve, a faded rock muse who's the sister of Roddy Grieve, an up-and-coming politico who turns up dead on the grounds of the boarded-up hospital that's being torn down to make way for the new Scottish Parliament. Grieve's body is the second in the space of days found at Queensberry House; the first was a skeleton bricked up in the fireplace. That decades-old murder seems to be tied to the suicide of a mysterious homeless man whose hefty bank balance is revealed well before his true identity. <blockquote>'So what's the story with Mr Supertramp anyway?'<p> 'He had all this money he either couldn't spend or didn't want to. He took on a new identity. My theory is that he was hiding.'</p><p> 'Maybe.' He was rifling through the scraps on the desk. She folded her arms, gave him a hard look which he failed to notice. He opened the bread bag and shook out the contents: disposable razor, a sliver of soap, toothbrush. 'An organized mind,' he said. 'Makes himself a wash bag. Doesn't like being dirty.'</p><p> 'It's like he was acting the part,' she said.</p></blockquote> There are always plenty of subplots in a Rankin mystery. This time he adds a stalker who happens to be one of Rebus's colleagues, a couple of toughs who hang out in singles clubs and finish their evenings with a rape or two, and the ongoing story of Rebus's tortured past--a bitter divorce, a daughter still recovering from a terrible accident, and a drinking problem. <i>Set in Darkness</i> hit the bestseller list in Great Britain and should enjoy the same success in its U.S. edition. Rankin's ability to keep finding new dimensions in Rebus, handle intricate plot details brilliantly, and evoke the gloom and darkness of his setting keep winning him new admirers, with just cause. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>IAN RANKIN</b> won England's prestigious Gold Dagger Award for <i>Black and Blue</i>, which was also an Edgar Award nominee.

Eisenhower</h2><p><p>In North Africa, on the beaches at Normandy, and in the Battle of the Bulge, Dwight David Eisenhower proved himself as one of the world's greatest military leaders. Faced with conciliating or disagreeing with such stormy figures as Churchill, Roosevelt, and DeGaulle, and generals like Montgomery and Patton, General Eisenhower showed himself to be as skillful a diplomat as he was a strategist. </p><p>Stephen E. Ambrose, associate editor of the General's official papers, analyzes his subject's decisions in The Supreme Commander, which Doubleday first published in 1970. Throughout the book Ambrose traces the steady development of Eisenhower's generalcy--from its dramatic beginnings through his time at the top post of Allied command. </p><p>The New York Times Book Review said of The Supreme Commander, "It is Mr. Ambrose's special triumph that he has been able to fight through the memoranda, the directives, plans, reports, and official self-serving pieties of the World War II establishment to uncover the idiosyncratic people at its center. ... General Dwight Eisenhower comes remarkably alive. ...[Ambrose's] angle of sight is so fresh and lively that one reads as if one did not know what was coming next. It is better than that: One does know what's coming next--not only the winning of a war but the making of a general--but the interest is in seeing how." </p><p>This study of Eisenhower's role in the world's biggest war is absorbing as reading and invaluable as a reference. </p><p>Stephen E. Ambrose was Director Emeritus of the Eisenhower Center, Boyd Professor of History at the University of New Orleans, and president of the National D- Day Museum. He was the author of many books, most recently <i>The Mississippi and the Making of a Nation: From the Louisana Purchase to Today</i>.

One of the nurses inserted a cannula into a vein on the inside of his left elbow to draw some blood. Another shone a flashlight alternately into each of the man&#x2019;s eyes, watching for the pupils to react to the brightness.</p><p>&#x201c;Still no response on either side,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>In a healthy person the constricting of the pupils due to light is an involuntary reflex reaction&#x2014;it happens without the individual having to think about it&#x2014;and the lack of it in both eyes could indicate abnormally high pressure in the head or damage to the brain stem, but it could also be the result of having taken certain drugs&#x2014;barbiturates, for example.</p><p>&#x201c;Ask the lab to specifically check for a drug overdose,&#x201d; I said to the nurse who was filling test tubes of blood from the cannula in the man&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Can we also get a urine sample?&#x201d;</p><p>Seeking to discover what was wrong with the man was a bit like a murder mystery in an Agatha Christie novel, with me taking on the role of the detective. There were many possible suspects for the cause of his condition and I had to determine the guilty one by eliminating each of the others in turn.</p><p>I let my team do the intricate work while I stood back trying to take in the bigger picture.</p><p>On the periphery of the group hovered a very young-looking uniformed policeman.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dr. Rankin, Chris Rankin. I&#x2019;m in charge of A&amp;E this evening.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;PC Filippos.&#x201d; He instinctively put out a hand but I didn&#x2019;t shake it because I was wearing sterile latex gloves.</p><p>&#x201c;Filippos?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;Half Greek. I came in with your patient.&#x201d; He waved a hand toward the man on the gurney. &#x201c;The �racecourse called us first. They thought he was drunk. It was me who called the ambulance.&#x201d;</p><p>I had wondered why it had taken so long for the man to get&nbsp;to&nbsp;the hospital.</p><p>&#x201c;Well done,&#x201d; I said to him.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with him?&#x201d; the policeman asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure yet. We have to run some more tests. But I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s drunk.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a slight trace of alcohol on the man&#x2019;s breath but not the usual overpoweringly sweet aroma of the unconscious drunk. I was well used to dealing with those on a Saturday night. We called them VIPs&#x2014;<i>very intoxicated persons</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Any idea who he is?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;None at all. I searched his pockets while waiting for the ambulance. All he had on him was eighty-two pounds in cash and one crumpled bookmaker&#x2019;s betting slip. No cards, no wallet, no keys, nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He must have had a coat,&#x201d; I said. It was far too cold in mid-November to be at the races in only a thin shirt.</p><p>The constable nodded. &#x201c;He did, and a jacket and tie. I have them bagged up.&#x201d; He lifted a clear plastic bag to show me. &#x201c;Shall I take the rest of his clothes to add to it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll need them to go home in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If he does go home,&#x201d; the policeman said flatly.</p><p>I glanced at him. &#x201c;Do you know something I don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure if he was telling me the truth.</p><p>One of the nurses interrupted us. &#x201c;Dr. Rankin, we&#x2019;re ready for the CT.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; I said to the policeman. &#x201c;I have to go with the patient.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait here,&#x201d; PC Filippos said with determination.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows at him in surprise.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably not necessary,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;ll wait anyway. Then, if he does come round, I&#x2019;ll be able to inform his family. He reminds me a bit of my dad, you know, in looks and the way he&#x2019;s dressed. I&#x2019;d want someone to tell me if my dad was found unconscious in a racecourse restroom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can wait in the relatives&#x2019; room,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a coffee machine in there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The CT&nbsp;scan was clear&#x2014;no visible clots or bleeds in the brain, and no tumor.</p><p>More suspects had been eliminated.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>I began to feel shaky again.</p><p><i>Stop it. Keep control.</i></p><p>I looked at the monitor that showed the man&#x2019;s heart beating 196 times per minute, even higher than when he was brought in. And the cardiac trace on the screen was becoming increasingly random, strikingly different from the nice smooth, repeating �pattern produced by a healthy organ. But, in spite of the irregularity of his heart, his blood pressure was holding up, indeed it was far too high, and the oxygen saturation was steady at 98 percent.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried about him,&#x201d; I said to my senior staff nurse.</p><p>We had been unable to obtain a urine sample for a dip drug test. Did that indicate that his kidneys were not working �properly? I also thought his skin displayed the slight yellowing of jaundice, so was there a problem with his liver function?</p><p>Both could be a direct result of his cardiac arrhythmia.</p><p>In medicine, as in life, one initial problem could all too quickly spawn a whole raft of secondary troubles.</p><p>The blood-test results should give us the answers but we were still waiting for those to come back from pathology. Nothing, it seemed, happened quickly on a Saturday anywhere else in the hospital. But accidents and emergencies didn&#x2019;t respect the normal working week. Indeed, Saturdays and Sundays were by far our busiest days.</p><p>&#x201c;His pulse is still far too fast and getting very irregular,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;His heart&#x2019;s clearly tiring. If it is SVT, then it&#x2019;s high time we tried to reset his rhythm back to normal.&#x201d;</p><p>I took a deep breath.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll give him six milligrams of adenosine,&#x201d; I said decisively.</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know what else he&#x2019;s taken,&#x201d; the staff nurse said&nbsp;with a note of caution.</p><p>Adenosine was an antiarrhythmic medication used to slow an abnormally high heart rate, but it could occasionally react badly with some psychotic drugs.</p><p>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;ll have to take that chance,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Have you checked him for puncture marks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did, and I couldn&#x2019;t find anything obvious.&#x201d;</p><p>Puncture marks in the skin were telltale signs of an �intravenous drug user&#x2014;and we saw far too many of those.</p><p>&#x201c;We could just wait for the results of the bloods,&#x201d; the staff nurse said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll surely be back soon.&#x201d;</p><p>If it had been a weekday between eight and six, I&#x2019;d have �simply phoned a specialist from the coronary unit for some advice, but, at nine o&#x2019;clock on a Saturday evening, they&#x2019;d all be either at home watching television or out socializing.</p><p>Should I page the on-call duty cardiologist? Drag him into the hospital from his dinner?</p><p>Decision time.</p><p>I was the senior physician here. If I made the call, the duty heart doctor would be my junior. So it would be my decision anyway.</p><p>Do nothing or do something?</p><p>Which was right?</p><p>I could feel the ends of my fingers beginning to tingle and my right knee began to tremble slightly.</p><p><i>Breathe,&nbsp;</i>I told myself.&nbsp;<i>In through my nose, hold for a second or two, and out through my mouth&#x2014;</i>just as I&#x2019;d been taught.</p><p><i>Breathe deeply, and again, and again.</i></p><p>The trembling in my knee slowly died away.</p><p>I looked again at the now-alarmingly uneven rapid trace on the monitor. Even if I paged the heart specialist, I was worried that the patient&#x2019;s condition might deteriorate before he arrived.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we can wait any longer,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;OK,&#x201d; the nurse said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Also get someone in here with the shocker.&#x201d;</p><p>She went off, leaving me alone in the cubicle with the patient.</p><p>I glanced down at the man.</p><p>He appeared even more vulnerable than when he&#x2019;d first arrived, probably because all his clothing had since been removed, replaced by a faded blue hospital gown that was not properly secured around his shoulders.</p><p>It was not that uncommon for unnamed trauma cases to arrive at A&amp;E, such as lone pedestrians knocked down by cars, but I thought it was a little odd for someone wearing a pinstripe suit plus a tie to have no identification on him whatsoever.</p><p>I touched his forehead. It was damp with perspiration.</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; I asked quietly into the stillness. &#x201c;And what&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t reply. I hadn&#x2019;t expected him to. Instead the monitor above his head simply went on showing me his erratic pulse and over-high blood pressure.</p><p>The staff nurse returned holding a small syringe containing the adenosine and a much larger one full of normal saline solution that would flush the drug around to the man&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>She was followed in by one of the emergency junior doctors, who was pushing a small metal cart on which sat the shocker&#x2014;the electrical defibrillator that would be used to give the patient&#x2019;s heart a restarting electric shock in the unlikely event that the adenosine caused a cardiac arrest.</p><p>The staff nurse connected both the syringes to the cannula on the inside of the man&#x2019;s elbow such that their barrels sat at right angles to each other.</p><p>&#x201c;OK?&#x201d; she asked, looking straight at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; I said, looking at the junior doctor.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I assume that the patient doesn&#x2019;t have a pacemaker fitted?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;He does not,&#x201d; I confirmed. It would have been obvious on the CT scan. But it was a good question. Shocking someone who had a pacemaker was still possible but greater care was needed in positioning the electrode plates.</p><p>&#x201c;OK,&#x201d; said the doctor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Go.&#x201d;</p><p>The nurse rapidly depressed the plunger of the small syringe and then immediately followed it with the complete contents of the larger.</p><p>Adenosine was rapidly metabolized by red blood cells with a very short half-life. Consequently, it was important to give it very quickly, together with a large bulk of saline, in the hope that enough of the active drug makes it to the heart to cause a temporary block in the atrioventricular node, which in turn should reset the heart back into a normal rhythm.</p><p>Our three sets of eyes were firmly fixed on the monitor screen. If the adenosine was going to work, it would do so almost immediately.</p><p>Initially, nothing happened, but then the trace went flat as the drug arrived at the heart and the block occurred.</p><p>I held my breath.</p><p>It was only a few seconds but it seemed like an age before any spikes reappeared. Erratic at first, then more regular, but still overly fast, the pulse counter almost immediately going back up to over 190.</p><p>The adenosine had failed to do the trick.</p><p>&#x201c;Bugger,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Double the dose and try again?&#x201d; asked the staff nurse. It was normal practice.</p><p>I nodded and she went off to fetch new syringes full of drug and saline.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure it&#x2019;s SVT?&#x201d; asked the junior doctor.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I replied, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. We&#x2019;re still waiting for the �results of his bloods to come back from the lab.&#x201d;</p><p>We stood in silence and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;Double adult trauma call, six minutes,&#x201d; said a seemingly disembodied voice over the department public address system.</p><p>Saturday night in A&amp;E.</p><p>Busier than an ice-cream seller in a heat wave.</p></p><h2>Blown Covers: New Yorker Covers You Were Never Meant to See</h2><p>Fran�oise Mouly takes us behind the scenes at the <i>New Yorker</i> and reveals how the magazine creates its signature covers commenting on the most urgent political and cultural events of the day.

Forster</h2><p>A REVELATORY LOOK AT THE INTIMATE LIFE OF THE GREAT AUTHOR&#x20ac;&#x201d;AND HOW IT SHAPED HIS MOST BE LOVED WORKS With the posthumous publication of his long-suppressed novel Maurice in 1970, E. M. Forster came out as a homosexual&#x20ac;&#x201d; though that revelation made barely a ripple in his literary reputation. As Wendy Moffat persuasively argues in A Great Unrecorded History, Forster&#x20ac;&#x2122;s homosexuality was the central fact of his life. Between Wilde&#x20ac;&#x2122;s imprisonment and the Stonewall riots, Forster led a long, strange, and imaginative life as a gay man. He preserved a vast archive of his private life&#x20ac;&#x201d;a history of gay experience he believed would find its audience in a happier time. A Great Unrecorded History is a biography of the heart. Moffat&#x20ac;&#x2122;s decade of detective work&#x20ac;&#x201d;including first-time interviews with Forster&#x20ac;&#x2122;s friends&#x20ac;&#x201d;has resulted in the first book to integrate Forster&#x20ac;&#x2122;s public and private lives.</p><p>WENDY MOFFAT is a professor of English at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;<i>A Great Unrecorded History</i>&nbsp;is her first book.&nbsp;1<br>&#x201c;A Queer Moment&#x201d;<br>It was just Lily and Morgan. This had not been the plan.<br>Alice Clara Whichelo, known as Lily, married a marvelous young architect after an eight-week engagement when she was twenty-one. Edward Morgan Forster was the son of a clergyman. Lily and Eddie settled near Dorset Square in London, a few blocks from the rose gardens of Regents Park&#x2014;a fine place for a young couple to start a family, and far enough away from Eddie&#x2019;s imposing relatives at Clapham to give them breathing space. It was January 1877. Eddie was twenty-nine, and a bit slow to get on his feet professionally. Coming down from Trinity College, Cambridge, he had taken a slightly crooked path, inching away from filial expectations that he become a vicar. He was just starting his career, and his family buoyed up the young people financially. His sister Laura, having inherited some money, commissioned him to draw up plans for a fine brick country house in Surrey.<br>Lily didn&#x2019;t know it, but her husband&#x2019;s commission of Laura Forster&#x2019;s West Hackhurst house would be the zenith of her happiness and security for a long time. She was pregnant within weeks of her wedding but their baby was stillborn. So ended the first year of her marriage. The next spring, almost before she had time to breathe, Lily was pregnant again. In the brief time before it would be unseemly for Lily to be seen traipsing about in public, Eddie took her to France to widen her horizons. His formidable &#x201c;Aunt Monie&#x201d;&#x2014;the family matriarch who financed the trip&#x2014;found the chaperoning arrangements rather unorthodox: &#x201c;no Lady companion&#x201d; for Lily unless one counted Eddie&#x2019;s university friend Ted Streatfeild, who accompanied the couple on their belated honeymoon. Streatfeild, Aunt Monie wrote acidly, was &#x201c;very nearly&#x201d; a lady companion, &#x201c;I own, but not quite.&#x201d; While Lily rested at the hotel, the men walked and talked. For them Paris was familiar territory. Eddie was &#x201c;very glib&#x201d; at speaking French.<br>By the time they returned to London, Lily was heavily pregnant. On New Year&#x2019;s Day 1879 she and Edward celebrated the birth of a son, also called Edward Morgan. Naming him thus came from a mistake at the baptismal font&#x2014;the alchemy of absentmindednesss and fear of social ostracism that would fuel Forster&#x2019;s first comic novels. In deference to Aunt Monie, the couple had settled on the family name Henry Morgan, the Henry honoring both Monie&#x2019;s father, Henry Thornton, and Eddie&#x2019;s brother Henry, a &#x201c;shining light&#x201d; who had died when Eddie was eighteen. So they had registered the baby&#x2019;s name in the official records, but when the verger read from the scrap of paper at the font, he found that Eddie&#x2014;&#x201c;distrait&#x201d;&#x2014;had written his own full name instead. To differentiate him from his father, they called him by his middle name. Soon after the baby was born, it was clear that Eddie was very ill. He developed a horrifying cough and all through the year he could not shake a cold. Through eighteen &#x201c;months of languor and sickness&#x201d; Lily &#x201c;could not take her husband&#x2019;s illness seriously.&#x201d; She was focused on the baby, and &#x201c;she was accustomed to young people remaining alive.&#x201d; Behind her back the Forsters and Eddie&#x2019;s maternal family, the Thorntons, were full of advice and recrimination.<br>Lily came by her obtuse optimism honestly, and it later served her well. Like her husband, she was one of ten children. But the Whichelos were a hearty family&#x2014;all her siblings were humming along, &#x201c;fond of pleasure, generous and improvident,&#x201d; full of &#x201c;good looks . . . good taste and good spirits.&#x201d; The Forsters were a more delicate bunch. Eddie, the eighth born, had already seen the death of five siblings from tuberculosis. One after the other they had been struck down; John, the firstborn, had lived all the way to the age of thirty-four, but the rest died in their teens and twenties. By the late summer of 1880 Lily realized that she must take the illness in hand. She rented a large house with a view of the sea in Bournemouth, and moved Eddie and the baby there to breathe the brisk salty air. But it was already too late. On October 30, 1880, Eddie died of tuberculosis, just ten days before his thirty-third birthday. Before her son was two, Lily was a twenty-five-year-old widow. Morgan wrote later, &#x201c;[S]he felt that her life had ended before it had begun.&#x201d; Her own words characterized her stupefying grief: &#x201c;I wish tonight would never turn into day and that I could go on sleeping forever, it would be so nice.&#x201d; Morgan was all she had left.There was no money on Lily&#x2019;s side of the family. Her father had been a drawing master&#x2014;a big, dreamy man who cobbled together a living. He had died suddenly when she was twelve, leaving her mother, Louisa, indefatigable and resourceful, to find ways of pressing her children out into the world. As the third of ten children and the eldest girl, Lily had learned to be stout-hearted, uncomplaining, and to take care of herself. In 1872, she had bought a diary which she wryly dedicated to herself, &#x201c;a great heroine . . . age 17, manners 71 years of age, from her infancy always very old for her age.&#x201d; Soon after, with an introduction from her family doctor, Lily became a companion to the neighboring Thorntons and a governess to the children of their friends. So she had met Eddie, and so she remained in the sway of his family after his death. Eddie had left a small inheritance. Seven thousand pounds would generate enough income for her to live a frugal middle-class life. By default Eddie had also left her to the redoubtable influence of his Aunt Monie, Marianne Thornton.<br>The Thorntons, Morgan Forster later came to understand, had a genetic gift: they &#x201c;always had known best&#x2014;it was part of their moral integrity.&#x201d; And Aunt Monie &#x201c;knew best better than ever&#x201d; as she aged. She was eighty-two when Morgan was born, and she claimed not only the financial and moral power to determine her favored great-nephew&#x2019;s future but a formidable family history to guide him. The Thorntons had all the gravitas and social influence the Whichelos lacked. They had been among the first families in Clapham for generations. Marianne&#x2019;s father, Henry Thornton, was a founding member of the Clapham Sect, a group of Christian evangelists who proved to be effective, if ornery, politicians in the early nineteenth century.<br>Henry Thornton&#x2019;s money came from banking. First he did well and then he did good. Family prayers were &#x201c;a discipline and an institution,&#x201d; Morgan wrote later. &#x201c;The Clapham Sect listened, rose from its knees, ate, and then made money&#x2014;made as much as ever it could, and then gave as much as it could away. The activity in either direction was immense.&#x201d; Thorntons were great moralists, and despite all opposition they Stood Up for What Was Right. Year after year, Henry Thornton stood up in Parliament to support bills that would make this world a little more like the next: bills to establish asylums for the insane, bills for parliamentary reform against sinecures and corruption, bills for peace with the Americas, bills to stabilize the banking system, which was hopelessly unregulated, always bubbling and bursting. Most famously, Thornton had been a great friend of William Wilberforce in the long campaign to end the British slave trade. Thornton was a moderate, humorless man who had not an ounce of whimsy in his bones. (His friend Hannah More had unironically named her two cats Non-resistance and Passive Obedience.) By the time of Eddie&#x2019;s death, in Marianne&#x2019;s hands the Thornton evangelical fervor had distilled to the essence of knowing what was right for Lily and the baby.<br>After a miserable and smothering year living in the gloom of Aunt Monie&#x2019;s large house in South London, Lily did something astonishing. She resisted her in-laws&#x2019; desire to envelop her, and set off to establish a separate household for herself and Morgan. In the autumn of 1882 she found an eighteenth-century redbrick house to let on four acres of land north of the city. The house was an island, even an idyll, suspended in time and place. Neither country nor yet fully suburban, Rooksnest stood at the margin of the village of Stevenage.<br>Morgan and Lily would live at Rooksnest for the next decade. Once there had been a hamlet and farm called Rooksnest, but those had disappeared, and now the name attached like a ghost to a two-story gabled house with plain windows and broad chimneys in the center of the roof and at one end. There was nothing particularly grand or historical about the house. To Morgan, whose first proper piece of writing was a memoir of the house, composed when he was fifteen, its very ordinary Englishness made it seem mystical, tied as it was to a past that was rapidly being eroded by the growth of suburban London. The walk to the village was about a mile. In the meadow beside the house was an ancient wych-elm in which people of the distant past had pressed boars&#x2019; fangs into the bark, little &#x201c;votive offerings of people who had their toothache cured by chewing pieces of the bark.&#x201d; Next door was the Franklyn farm, where there were ponies and children to play with, and a barn full of sweet straw to hide in. The kitchen garden was big enough to be hard work. Lily adapted the lawn for tennis. She and Morgan lived with two domestic servants&#x2014;one for indoors and one for out. There might have been a moat, so socially isolated was their little household. Years later Forster immortalized the house, and the feeling of the house, in a novel. He called it Howards End.<br>In Howards End the house is haunted not by a literal ghost but by a sort of genius loci. Eddie&#x2019;s ghost, if it walked at all, signified a lost world that might have supplanted or at least balanced out the &#x201c;haze of elderly ladies&#x201d;&#x2014;the aunts and great-aunts, Victorian matrons who formed the only circle of friends with whom Lily felt comfortable. The lost world, Morgan came to understand, was an unspoken world, not only male but homoerotic. When he was in his mid-seventies, preparing a biography of Marianne Thornton, Morgan thought back on the oddities that he had stubbornly gleaned from Eddie&#x2019;s short life. There was the unusual interest in aesthetics, fashion, and the decorative arts, the kind of pursuit au courant with Oscar Wilde and his set at Oxford. In facing marriage, Eddie was described as &#x201c;not wild like L[ily] but as befitted his seven more years all aglow with happiness and having looked &#x2018;things&#x2019; steadily in the face . . .&#x201d; Things? Why did the milk-livered Ted Streatfeild accompany the couple to Paris? Why had Aunt Monie worried that Eddie &#x201c;won&#x2019;t be too old maidish to walk you down the Boulevard Italienne at night&#x201d;? Then there was the strange companionship, akin to an informal adoption, between his dashing young uncle Percy Whichelo and an older military gentleman. In retrospect, Morgan thought &#x201c;the implication was obvious.&#x201d; It was not merely wish fulfillment to see the root of his homosexuality in his family&#x2019;s past.<br>At Rooksnest, Lily Forster established the domestic pattern that would last the rest of her life: she and her boy against the world. She never remarried. Mother and son lived alone on a delicate reef of interdependence. A formal photograph taken when Morgan was five suggests the balance of power. The picture looks mid-Victorian though it was taken thirty years later. Wearing a little velvet suit with lace cuffs and collar, Mary Janes and stockings, his long hair cascading down his back, Morgan appears as an androgynous little Lord Fauntleroy. Though he is stout, Lily is shielding him as if he&#x2019;s delicate. She stands behind him, not yet thirty, still dressed in mourning, her long hair pulled back in an elegant coil of plaits. Steadying him with her right hand, his mother looks down at him adoringly. But Morgan&#x2014;with wide blue eyes&#x2014;faces the camera directly with the attitude of an odalisque.<br>Aunt Monie had given Morgan the &#x201c;deplorable&#x201d; nickname &#x201c;The Important One,&#x201d; and it had grown less and less ironic over the years. He was accustomed to being the center of attention, but oddly this didn&#x2019;t translate into narcissism. Because he was intensely filial and intensely sensitive, Morgan felt the weight of his role as Lily&#x2019;s reason for living. He was a solemn little boy, often very still. He watched with interest the delicate dance women must adopt to be heard by men. He became in effect Lily&#x2019;s lady companion. So close were he and Lily that their identities seemed to merge. He parroted her habit of cosseting and her intense interest in the exquisite proprieties of social standing and social etiquette. To his two dolls, Sailor Dollar and Sailor Duncan, he told long, complicated stories about what could and shouldn&#x2019;t be done. One afternoon when Morgan was five he and Lily settled down to play &#x201c;our usual game at B�zique. M. had S. Duncan stuck under his arm, which a good deal interfered with his play. At last he said so gravely &#x2018;I am having such a miserable time with this doll. Do you think he would mind much not learning the game?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>Learning the game seemed to be the key to living life. The whole of the world appeared as a set of rules, to be negotiated with care if you were not powerful. There seemed to be ways to earn a little safety. At the age of four, Morgan told his mother he &#x201c;would much rather be a coward than brave because people hurt you when you are brave.&#x201d; At other times, it seemed that however much one tried, who you were was determined by whether you could adequately act a part. But both his anachronistic dress and his extremely sensitive manner made him seem &#x201c;half a girl,&#x201d; Lily complained. &#x201c;I wish he was more manly and did not cry so easily.&#x201d; Once, when he was mistaken for a girl by a servant, he was told to go back and correct the misapprehension. Dutifully, he returned and announced, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a little boy.&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, miss,&#x201d; was the reply.<br>He was clever. By the age of four, he discovered that he could read. Thereafter he fiercely defended his interior life, commenting to Aunt Monie&#x2019;s maid that it was &#x201c;[t]iresome to be interrupted in my reading when the light is so good.&#x201d; Learning to read opened a vista into a separate life&#x2014;a life apart from Life, which he figured in a piece of juvenile fiction as a &#x201c;secret place.&#x201d; Here it was possible to slow things down to consider them, to magnify feelings, to roll them around in the brain, to hone the strange interior truths of being and feeling. In later years, he crystallized these insights into a very funny, very sad essay he called &#x201c;Notes on the English Character.&#x201d; &#x201c;It is not,&#x201d; Morgan wrote there, &#x201c;that the Englishman can&#x2019;t feel&#x2014;it is that he is afraid to feel.&#x201d; The essence of English character is to &#x201c;measure out emotions . . . as if they were potatoes.&#x201d; Even as a young boy, Morgan was both trapped in the English character and a connoisseur of its vagaries. When he was only four, he spent days earnestly studying an etiquette book for children. The book was titled Don&#x2019;t!<br>He became a keen pupil of different kinds of knowledge. There was the bilingualism of women, their private talk and their careful, vicious, oblique wielding of social power. And there was dream knowledge, a magical, incantatory way to discover what is already known to be true. In Maurice, he would write, &#x201c;Maurice had two dreams at school; they will interpret him.&#x201d; The wishes that acted upon, or acted for, the passive Morgan were centered on affection for men. The warm, diffuse, disembodied yearning for connection and intimacy that appeared as a voice calling out in the dark, and the panicky, miserable jolt of fear when the yearning became embodied in any way. Thinking about things was relatively safe. Touching was not.<br>So Morgan persisted in trying to figure himself out in a kind of vacuum. His earliest self-knowledge was sexual and tinged with homoerotic hunger. At Rooksnest, this island where there were no men, he sought the company of Ansell, a neighboring garden boy, confiding in him and relishing his unknowing...</p><h2>The King's Grave: The Discovery of Richard III&#x2019;s Lost Burial Place and the Clues It Holds</h2><p><p>The first full-length book about the discover of Richard III's remains by the person who led the archeology team and the historian whose book spurred her on</p><p>The mystery of who Richard III really was has fascinated historians, readers and audiences familiar with Shakespeare's dastardly portrait of a hunchback monster of royalty for centuries. Earlier this year, the remains of a man with a curving spine, who possible was killed in battle, were discovered underneath the paving of a parking lot in Leicester, England. Phillipa Langley, head of The Richard III Society, spurred on by the work of the historian Michael Jones, led the team of who uncovered the remains, certain that she had found the bones of the monarch. When DNA verification later confirmed that the skeleton was, indeed, that of King Richard III, the discovery ranks among the great stories of passionate intuition and perseverance against the odds. The news of the discovery of Richard's remains has been widely reported by the British as well as worldwide and was front page news for both the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>The Washington Post</i>. Many believe that now, with King Richard III's skeleton in hand, historians will finally begin to understand what happened to him following the Battle of Bosworth Field (twenty miles or so from Leicester) and, ultimately, to know whether he was the hateful, unscrupulous monarch of Shakespeare's drama or a much more benevolent king interested in the common man. Written in alternating chapters, with Richard's 15th century life told by historian Michael Jones (author of the critically acclaimed <i>Bosworth - 1485</i>) contrasting with the 21st century eyewitness account of the search and discovery of the body by Philippa Langley, <i>The King's Grave</i> will be both an extraordinary portrait of the last Plantagenet monarch and the inspiring story of the archaeological dig that finally brings the real King Richard III into the light of day.</p></p><p><p>PHILIPPA LANGLEY is a screenwriter and producer who inaugurated and led the successful archaeological search to locate King Richard III's grave in Leicester.

Tour.</p><p>Between the lines of bombast, self-aggrandizement and special pleading in the notorious barrister&#39;s memoirs, the careful listener can extract--or rather infer--important history of the last 30 years. Beginning with the trial of the Chicago Seven, Kunstler has defended many of the leading political iconoclasts of our age. The recording benefits from period music and snippets of vintage news audio for scene setting. But the best part is the author&#39;s well-known gravelly, heavily accented voice. Shut your eyes and you feel that you&#39;re a jury member listening to the defendant&#39;s summation in the case of Kunstler vs Posterity. Y.R. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineIn this bafflingly disappointing autobiography, Kunstler, radical lawyer extraordinaire, is once again arguing a difficult case--this time his own. As defense attorney in some of this country's highest profile political courtroom dramas, throughout his astounding career (he's now 75) Kunstler has chosen to champion political causes rather than people--causes that were often very unpopular (he's currently representing Colin Ferguson, charged with murder on the Long Island Railroad). His rallying cry is the defense of the underdog, those he feels are most rejected by society and who therefore risk missing out on that all-American right: a good defense. But his hard-hitting remarks here (written with Isenberg, Women Who Love Men Who Kill, 1991) about the corruption and racism of the American judiciary get drowned in dry, criminally uniformative narrative that belies the passion it is intended to convey. Instead of offering us a unique view of cases involving Abbie Hoffman and the Yippies, Martin Luther King, and others, we get empty apologies for a childhood appreciation of ``Amos 'n' Andy'' and compulsive philandering during his many travels. He intriguingly calls the Kennedys ``dangerous,'' but presents no further explanation, and his criticism of another leftie lawyer, former NAACP director Jack Greenberg (Crusaders in the Courts, p. 363) smacks of petty in- fighting. Kunstler's career has followed the political times: Earlier in his career he considered any situation in which a black man shot a white cop to be a political case; today he finds himself rushing to defend Arabs (i.e., the World Trade Center bombing case). Though he gives an interesting if idiosyncratic introduction to legal politics, Kunstler seems primarily obsessed with his outsider status; he needs to prove that he is hip and sexy despite his briefcase. One would have hoped for more from a man who has stood up for justice in courtrooms often determined to undermine it. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A poet, novelist and essayist, Berry is first and foremost a small farmer who works his ancestral land in rural Kentucky. These poems reflect a utopian visionreminiscent of the religion of the Native American peoplethat relates human life to the cycles of the Earth. Organized by years rather than by specific titles, Berry's lyrical hymns follow the seasons of birth and death, growth and decay, over a seven-year period, from 1979 to 1986. According to this writer's system of values, death holds no real terror; instead, the danger that confronts humankind is our increasing alienation from the land. Berry is widely admired for his authenticity and his deep commitment to an ideal way of life.

Annabelle Perkins, a spinster of 57 who waits tables, has a little bronze lamb she wants to take to Bethlehem as a gift for baby Jesus. Her mother had always told her that they would take it together. But now her parents are dead. Annabelle deposits $200 on a $2,000 Christmas trip to the Holy Land. She doesn't earn much and has a bad heart as well, but she puts in an extra day a week at the restaurant and by November is ready for the trip. Then, however, she learns that the daughter of one of her regular customers is going to drop out of collegeshe's run out of money. Baby Jesus whispers to Annabelle, Give me my gift now. So Annabelle anonymously sends her savings in a postal money order to the girl. Next year, Annabelle again saves up for the trip, but this time she reads that an ex-boyfriend has a daughter who needs a kidney transplant (price: $50,000). Baby Jesus whispers again. And Annabelle sends the money to the ex, anonymously. Next year, the same kind of giveaway occurs. Now she's too weak to work overtime (and thus save for the fare).

Annabelle Perkins, a 57-year-old unmarried waitress with a weak heart, is set on visiting the Holy Land in order to bring "to the baby Jesus" the gift of a bronze ("but really gold, as gold as the gold of the Magi") lamb her deceased mother has left her. She tells the travel agent, Mr. Olson, that she doesn't need to see Jerusalem, only Bethlehem, and when she leaves his agency she feels suddenly empowered: "She was one of the Magi on a fabulous journey." She scrimps and savesAyet when she finally has enough to pay off the ticket, she discovers that someone else has a greater need of the money. Prompted by the voice of her mother, she gives the money away. Another year passes, and another needier case warrants her hard-earned savings, though Mr. Olson unaccountably informs her that her ticket has been paid in full. Pearson's tale is a kind of Simple Heart for believers; but its mawkish sentimentality combined with wooden and clich?-ridden prose should limit its audience to those who like their doses of spiritual uplift in childlike portions. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Perplexors: Level D Activity Book for Kids Ages 12-14 | 48 Pages - Mind Games with Logic Puzzles, Great Brain Games Perfect as Teaching &amp; School Supplies, Books for Teens and Kids Gifts - 1 Pc</h2><p>MindWare is a creator, manufacturer, and distributor of Brainy Toys for people of all ages.

In the sixties this included the exhilarating highs of breaking the rules of staid, status-conscious America. It also included the material and spiritual wear that a personal and thorough research of drugs can produce. In this memoir, Coyote relives his fifteen-year ride through the heart of the counterculture - a journey that took him from the quiet rooms of privilege as the son of an East Coast stockbroker to the riotous life of political street theater and the self-imposed poverty of West Coast communal movements.</p><p>As the generation that launched America's counterculture in the 1960s matures into its gray ponytails and 401(k) plans, one might expect the autobiographies of its celebrities to be tinged with apology for goals unrealized. Indeed, with only a few notable exceptions, such as Peter Fonda's <i>Don't Tell Dad</i>, most celebrity autobiographies from '60s pop culture icons seem rooted in either bitterness or desperation. Fortunately, in <i>Sleeping Where I Fall</i>, Peter Coyote neither apologizes for his wild days nor waxes romantic for them. Nor should he. <p> This wise and witty, tightly crafted narrative reports on the turbulence of that era with philosophical integrity, wry humor, and unmitigated honesty. Looking back over his days with the San Francisco Mime Troupe, a street theater group that sought to break the conventional boundaries between performer and audience, Coyote rhapsodizes with equal vigor about the company's artistic triumphs and the pulchritude of its actresses. While his developing acting career and romantic misadventures comprise a great deal of the narrative, an even larger part dwells on his life as one of The Diggers, the band of anarchistic counterculturalists who fought against commercial culture's ability to co-opt the superficial elements of youthful rebellion by rejecting the very notions of ownership and extrinsic value. "The Diggers," writes Coyote, "understood that <i>style</i> is infinitely co-optable. What could not be co-opted was doing things for free-without money." And what things they did! Coyote recounts the lives and times of poets, actors, farmers, and philosophers who participated in a profound cultural experiment that tested the very limits of human consciousness and fell--eventually--to the excesses of personal indulgence. </p><p> Coyote's evolution from callow thespian to revolutionary communard to seasoned philosopher is fascinating, as much a social and political history as it is a reminiscence. The stories unravel like tender after-dinner tales in prose that captures the rasp and tickle of Coyote's corduroy voice. In the end, <i>Sleeping Where I Fall</i> reveals a man as complex and unpredictable as the totem animal from which he takes his name. <i>--L.A. Smith</i></p>Peter Coyote has performed in more than fifty films, including Bitter Moon, E.T., Jagged Edge, Kika, Outrageous Fortune, and Sphere.

Born in Osaka, he started writing novels while still working as an engineer at Nippon Denso Co. He won the Edogawa Rampo Prize, which is awarded annually to the finest mystery work, in 1985 for the novel Hokago (After School) at age 27. Subsequently, he quit his job and started a career as a writer in Tokyo.<p>Chapter One</p><p>At 7:35 A.M. Ishigami left his apartment as he did every weekday morning. Just before stepping out onto the street, he glanced at the mostly full bicycle lot, noting the absence of the green bi�cycle. Though it was already March, the wind was bitingly cold. He walked with his head down, burying his chin in his scarf. A short way to the south, about twenty yards, ran Shin-Ohashi Road. From that intersection the road ran east into the Edogawa dis�trict, west toward Nihonbashi. Just before Nihonbashi, it crossed the Sumida River at the Shin-Ohashi Bridge. </p><p>The quickest route from Ishigami&#x2019;s apartment to his work�place was due south. It was only a quarter mile or so to Seicho Garden Park. He worked at the private high school just before the park. He was a teacher. He taught math. </p><p>Ishigami walked south to the red light at the intersection, then he turned right, toward Shin-Ohashi Bridge. The wind blew in his face, making his coat flap around him. He thrust his hands deep into his pockets and hunched over, quickening his pace. </p><p>A thick layer of clouds covered the sky, their gray reflection making the Sumida River look even murkier than usual. A small boat was making its way upstream. Ishigami noted its progress as he crossed the bridge. </p><p>On the other side, he took a set of stairs that led from the foot of the bridge down to the Sumida. Passing beneath the iron struts of the bridge, he began to walk along the river. Pedestrian walkways were built into the molded concrete riverbanks on both sides of the water. Further down, near Kiyosu Bridge, families and couples often strolled along the river, but such people seldom vis�ited the riverbanks this far up. The long row of cardboard shan�ties covered in blue vinyl sheets kept them away. This was where the homeless lived, in the shadow of an expressway overpass that ran along the west side of the river. Ishigami figured the looming overpass must have provided some shelter from the wind and rain. The fact that not a single shack stood on the other side of the river gave weight to this hypothesis, though it was possible the first squatters had settled there by accident and the others had simply followed them, preferring the safety of their community, such as it was, to solitude across the water. </p><p>He made his way down the row of shanties, glancing briefly at them as he walked. Most were barely tall enough for a man to stand up inside, and some of the structures only rose as high as his waist. They were more boxes than shacks. Maybe it was enough to have a place to sleep. </p><p>Plastic laundry hangers had been rigged up near the boxes, signs of domestic life. A man was leaning up against the railing that ran between the walkway and the water, brushing his teeth. Ishigami had seen him around. He was past sixty, and his gray�ish white hair was bound in a long ponytail. He had probably given up on work. If it was physical labor he wanted, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been hanging around now. Those jobs were filled in the early morning hours. He wouldn&#x2019;t be going to the unemploy�ment office, either. Even if they did find a job suitable for him, with that long hair of his he&#x2019;d never make it as far as the inter�view. The chances of anyone wanting him for a job at his age were close to zero anyway. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another man stood near his sleeping box, crushing a row of empty cans under his foot. Ishigami had witnessed this scene sev�eral times before, and he had secretly named this fellow the Can Man. The Can Man looked to be around fifty. He had good clothes and even a bicycle. Ishigami figured that his can-collecting trips kept him more active and alert than the others. He lived at the edge of the community, deep under the bridge, which must have been a position of privilege. The Can Man was a village elder, then&#x2014;an old-timer, even in this crowd&#x2014;or so Ishigami saw him. </p><p>A little way on from where the line of cardboard shanties petered out, another man was sitting on a bench. His coat must have once been beige, but now it was scuffed and gray. He was wearing a suit jacket underneath it, though, and beneath that a white work shirt. Ishigami guessed that he had a necktie stashed away in his coat pocket. Ishigami had labeled him the Engineer a few days earlier, after spotting him reading an industrial trade magazine. He kept his hair cropped short, and he shaved. Maybe he hoped he&#x2019;d be going back to work soon. He would be off to the unemployment office today, but he probably wouldn&#x2019;t find a job. He would have to lose his pride before that happened. Ishi�gami had first seen the Engineer about ten days ago. He wasn&#x2019;t used to life along the river yet, still drawing an imaginary line between himself and the blue vinyl sheets. Yet here he stayed, not knowing how to live on his own without a home. </p><p>Ishigami continued walking along the river. Just before Kiyosu Bridge, he came upon an elderly woman taking three dogs for a walk. The dogs were miniature dachshunds, each with a different colored collar, one red, one blue, and one pink. As he approached, the woman seemed to notice him. She smiled and nodded. He nodded in reply. </p><p>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; he offered. </p><p>&#x201c;Good morning. Cold, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; he replied, grimacing for effect. </p><p>The old woman bade him a good day as she passed by, and he gave her a final nod. </p><p>Some days before, Ishigami had seen the woman carrying a plastic convenience store bag with something like sandwiches in it&#x2014;probably her breakfast. He surmised from this that she lived alone. Her home wouldn&#x2019;t be far from here. She was wearing flip-flops, and she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to drive a car in those. She had probably lost her husband years before and now lived in a nearby apartment with her three dogs. A big place, if she was keeping three dogs there. No doubt her pets had kept her from moving to a smaller room somewhere. Maybe she had already paid off the mortgage, but there would still be maintenance fees, so she had to scrimp and save. She hadn&#x2019;t been to the beauty salon once this winter. Her hair showed its natural color, free from dye. </p><p>At the foot of Kiyosu Bridge, Ishigami climbed the stairs back up to the road. The school was across the bridge from here, but he turned and walked in the opposite direction. </p><p>A sign facing the road read &#x201c;Benten-tei.&#x201d; Beneath it was a small shop that made boxed lunches. Ishigami slid open the aluminum- framed glass door. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning! Come in, come in,&#x201d; came the call. It was a familiar greeting and a familiar voice, but it somehow always managed to put a spring in his step. Yasuko Hanaoka smiled at him from behind the counter. She was wearing a white hat. </p><p>Ishigami felt another thrill as he realized that there were no other customers in the shop. They were alone. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the special.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;One special, coming up,&#x201d; she replied brightly. Ishigami couldn&#x2019;t see her expression as he was staring into his wallet, unable to look her in the face. Given that they lived next door to each other, Ishigami felt like he should have something to talk about other than his boxed lunch order, but nothing came to mind. </p><p>When he finally came up with &#x201c;Cold today, isn&#x2019;t it,&#x201d; he mumbled the words, and they were lost in the sound of another customer opening the sliding glass door behind him. Yasuko&#x2019;s attention had turned to the new arrival. </p><p>Boxed lunch in hand, Ishigami walked out of the store. This time, he headed straight for Kiyosu Bridge, his detour to Benten- tei finished. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After the morning rush, things slowed down at Benten-tei, at least as far as customers were concerned. In the back, however, there were lunches to be made. Several local companies had the shop deliver meals for all their employees by twelve o&#x2019;clock. So, when the customers stopped coming, Yasuko would go back into the kitchen to lend a hand. </p><p>There were four employees at Benten-tei. Yonazawa was the manager, assisted by his wife Sayoko. Kaneko, a part-timer, was responsible for making deliveries, while Yasuko dealt with all the in-shop customers. </p><p>Before her current job, Yasuko had worked in a nightclub in Kinshicho. Yonazawa had been a regular there and Sayoko had been the club&#x2019;s <i>mama</i>&#x2014; though Yasuko hadn&#x2019;t known they were married until just before Sayoko quit. </p><p>&#x201c;She wants to go from being the <i>mama</i> at a bar to the good wife at a lunch shop,&#x201d; Yonazawa had told her. &#x201c;Can you believe it? Some people never fail to surprise me.&#x201d; Rumors had begun to fly at the club, but according to Sayoko, it had been the couple&#x2019;s long-held dream to run a place of their own. She had only been working at the club to save up for that. </p><p>After Benten-tei opened, Yasuko had made a habit of drop�ping in now and then to see how the two were doing. Business was apparently good&#x2014;good enough that, a year later, they asked her if she&#x2019;d be interested in helping out. It had become too much for the two of them to handle on their own. </p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go on in that shady business forever, Yasuko,&#x201d; Say�oko had told her. &#x201c;Besides, Misato&#x2019;s getting bigger. You wouldn&#x2019;t want her developing a complex because her mom&#x2019;s a nightclub hostess. Of course,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d added, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s none of my business.&#x201d; </p><p>Misato was Yasuko&#x2019;s only daughter. There was no father in her life after Yasuko&#x2019;s last divorce, five years ago. Yasuko hadn&#x2019;t needed Sayoko to tell her she couldn&#x2019;t go on as she was. Besides her daughter&#x2019;s welfare, there was her own age to consider. It was far from clear how long she could have kept her job even if she wanted it. </p><p>It only took her a day to come to a decision, and the club didn&#x2019;t even try to hold on to her. They had just wished her well, and that was all. Apparently she hadn&#x2019;t been the only one con�cerned about her future there. </p><p>She had moved into her current apartment in the spring a year ago, which coincided with Misato entering junior high school. Her old place was too far from her new job. And, unlike the club, get�ting to her new work on time meant getting up by six and being on her bicycle by six thirty. Her green bicycle. </p><p>&#x201c;That high school teacher come again today?&#x201d; Sayoko asked her during a break. </p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t he come every day?&#x201d; Yasuko replied, catching Say�oko sharing a grin with her husband. &#x201c;What? What&#x2019;s that for?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh nothing, nothing. We were just saying the other day how we thought he might fancy you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Whaaat?&#x201d; Yasuko leaned back from the table, a cup of tea in her hand. </p><p>&#x201c;You were off yesterday, weren&#x2019;t you? Well, guess what? He didn&#x2019;t come in yesterday. Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s strange that he should come every day, except for the days when you&#x2019;re not here?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s a coincidence.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, we think maybe it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d; Sayoko glanced again at her husband. </p><p>Yonazawa nodded, still grinning. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been going on for a while now,&#x201d; he said with a nod at his wife. &#x201c;&#x2018;Every day that Yas�uko&#x2019;s out, he doesn&#x2019;t come here for his lunch,&#x2019; she says. I&#x2019;d won�dered about it myself, to tell the truth, and when he didn&#x2019;t show yesterday, that kind of confirmed it for me.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t have any set vacations, other than the days the whole shop is closed. It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m out every Monday or some�thing obvious like that.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Which makes it even more suspicious!&#x201d; Sayoko concluded, a twinkle in her eye. &#x201c;He lives next door to you, doesn&#x2019;t he? He must see you leave for work. That&#x2019;s how he knows.&#x201d; </p><p>Yasuko shook her head. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve never met him on my way out, not even once.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s watching you from someplace. A window, maybe?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he can see my door from his window.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;In any case, if he is interested, he&#x2019;ll say something sooner or later,&#x201d; Yonazawa said. &#x201c;As far as we&#x2019;re concerned, we have a regu�lar customer thanks to you, so it&#x2019;s good news for us. Looks like your training in Kinshicho paid off.&#x201d; </p><p>Yasuko gave a wry smile and drank down the rest of her tea, thinking about the high school teacher. </p><p>His name was Ishigami. She had gone to his apartment the night she moved in to introduce herself. That&#x2019;s when she&#x2019;d learned he was a teacher. He was a heavyset man, with a big, round face that made his small eyes look thin as threads. His hair was thin�ning and cut short, making him look nearly fifty, though he might easily have been much younger. He wasn&#x2019;t particularly fashion conscious, always wearing the same sort of clothes. This winter, when he came in to buy his lunch, he was wearing the same coat over a brown sweater. Still, he did do his laundry, as was evidenced by the occasional presence of a drying rack on the small balcony of his apartment. He was single and, Yasuko guessed, not a divorc� or widower. </p><p>She thought back, trying to remember something that might have clued her in to his interest, but came up with nothing. He was like the thin crack in her apartment wall. She knew it was there, but she had never paid it that much attention. It just wasn&#x2019;t worth paying attention to. </p><p>They exchanged greetings whenever they met and had even discussed the management at their apartment building once. Yet Yasuko found she knew very little about the man himself. She had only recently learned that he taught math, when she happened to notice outside his apartment door a bundle of old math textbooks, wrapped in string and awaiting disposal. </p><p>Yasuko hoped he wouldn&#x2019;t ask her out on a date. Then she smiled to herself, trying and failing to imagine the dour-looking man&#x2019;s face as he asked the question. </p><p>As on every other day, the midday rush at Benten-tei began right before lunchtime, peaking just after noon. Things didn&#x2019;t really quiet down again until after one o&#x2019;clock. </p><p>Yasuko was sorting the bills in the register when the sliding glass door opened and someone walked in. &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she chimed automatically, looking up. Then she froze. Her eyes opened wide and her voice caught in her throat. </p><p>&#x201c;You look well,&#x201d; said the man who was standing there. He was smiling, but his eyes were darkly clouded. </p><p>&#x201c;You . . .&nbsp; how did you find me here?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Is it so surprising? I can find out where my ex-wife works if I have a mind to.&#x201d; The man looked around the shop, both hands thrust into the pockets of his dark navy windbreaker, like a pro�spective customer trying to figure out what he should buy. </p><p>&#x201c;But why? Why now?&#x201d; Yasuko asked, her voice sharp but low. </p><p>She glowered at him, inwardly praying that the Yonazawas in the back wouldn&#x2019;t hear them talking. </p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look so frightening. How long has it been since I saw you last? And you can&#x2019;t even manage a polite smile?&#x201d; He grinned. </p><p>Yasuko shivered. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re here to chitchat, you can save your�self the trouble and turn around right now.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Actually, I came for a reason. I have a favor to ask. Think you can get out for a bit?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be an idiot. Can&#x2019;t you see I&#x2019;m working?&#x201d; Yasuko said, then immediately regretted it. <i>That made it sound like I would have talked with him if I wasn&#x2019;t at work</i>. </p><p>The man licked his lips. &#x201c;What time do you get off?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. I don&#x2019;t want to talk to you. Please, just leave and don&#x2019;t come back.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Ouch. Cold.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What did you expect?&#x201d; </p><p>Yasuko glanced outside, hoping that a customer would walk in, but the street w...</p></p><h2>We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</h2><p>We-are-All-Completely-Beside-Ourselves</p><p><p><strong>Karen Joy Fowler</strong> is the author of <em>The Jane Austen Book Club</em>, which was on bestseller lists nationwide and spent thirteen weeks on the <em>New York Times</em> list.

We have a home movie taken when I was two years old, the old-fashioned kind with no sound track, and by now the colors have bled out&#x2014;a white sky, my red sneakers a ghostly pink&#x2014;but you can still see how much I used to talk.</p><p>I&#x2019;m doing a bit of landscaping, picking up one stone at a time from our gravel driveway, carrying it to a large tin washtub, dropping it in, and going back for the next. I&#x2019;m working hard, but showily. I widen my eyes like a silent film star. I hold up a clear piece of quartz to be admired, put it in my mouth, stuff it into one cheek.</p><p>My mother appears and removes it. She steps back then, out of the frame, but I&#x2019;m speaking emphatically now&#x2014;you can see this in my gestures&#x2014;and she returns, drops the stone into the tub. The whole thing lasts about five minutes and I never stop talking.</p><p>A few years later, Mom read us that old fairy tale in which one sister (the older) speaks in toads and snakes and the other (the younger) in flowers and jewels, and this is the image it conjured for me, this scene from this movie, where my mother puts her hand into my mouth and pulls out a diamond.</p><p>I was towheaded back then, prettier as a child than I&#x2019;ve turned out, and dolled up for the camera. My flyaway bangs are pasted down with water and held on one side by a rhinestone barrette shaped like a bow. Whenever I turn my head, the barrette blinks in the sunlight. My little hand sweeps over my tub of rocks. All this, I could be saying, all this will be yours someday.</p><p>Or something else entirely. The point of the movie isn&#x2019;t the words themselves. What my parents valued was their extravagant abundance, their inexhaustible flow.</p><p>Still, there were occasions on which I had to be stopped. When you think of two things to say, pick your favorite and only say that, my mother suggested once, as a tip to polite social behavior, and the rule was later modified to one in three. My father would come to my bedroom door each night to wish me happy dreams and I would speak without taking a breath, trying desperately to keep him in my room with only my voice. I would see his hand on the doorknob, the door beginning to swing shut. I have something to say! I&#x2019;d tell him, and the door would stop midway.</p><p>Start in the middle then, he&#x2019;d answer, a shadow with the hall light behind him, and tired in the evenings the way grown-ups are. The light would reflect in my bedroom window like a star you could wish on.</p><p>Skip the beginning. Start in the middle.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Part One</p><p>The storm which blew me out of my past eased off.</p><p>&#x2014;FRANZ KAFKA, &#x201c;A Report for an Academy&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>One</p><p>SO THE MIDDLE of my story comes in the winter of 1996. By then, we&#x2019;d long since dwindled to the family that old home movie foreshadowed&#x2014;me, my mother, and, unseen but evident behind the camera, my father. In 1996, ten years had passed since I&#x2019;d last seen my brother, seventeen since my sister disappeared. The middle of my story is all about their absence, though if I hadn&#x2019;t told you that, you might not have known. By 1996, whole days went by in which I hardly thought of either one.</p><p>1996. Leap year. Year of the Fire Rat. President Clinton had just been reelected; this would all end in tears. Kabul had fallen to the Taliban. The Siege of Sarajevo had ended. Charles had recently divorced Diana.</p><p>Hale-Bopp came swinging into our sky. Claims of a Saturn-like object in the comet&#x2019;s wake first surfaced that November. Dolly, the cloned sheep, and Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer program, were superstars. There was evidence of life on Mars. The Saturn-like object in Hale-Bopp&#x2019;s tail was maybe an alien spaceship. In May of &#x2019;97, thirty-nine people would kill themselves as a prerequisite to climbing aboard.</p><p>Against this backdrop, how ordinary I look. In 1996, I was twenty-two years old, meandering through my fifth year at the University of California, Davis, and still maybe only a junior or maybe a senior, but so thoroughly uninterested in the niceties of units or requirements or degrees that I wouldn&#x2019;t be graduating anytime soon. My education, my father liked to point out, was wider than it was deep. He said this often.</p><p>But I saw no reason to hurry. I&#x2019;d no particular ambitions beyond being either widely admired or stealthily influential&#x2014;I was torn between the two. It hardly mattered, as no major seemed to lead reliably to either.</p><p>My parents, who were still paying my expenses, found me aggravating. My mother was often aggravated those days. It was something new for her, analeptic doses of righteous aggravation. She was rejuvenated by it. She&#x2019;d recently announced that she was through being a translator and go-between for me and my father; he and I had hardly spoken since. I don&#x2019;t remember minding. My father was himself a college professor and a pedant to the bone. Every exchange contained a lesson, like the pit in a cherry. To this day, the Socratic method makes me want to bite someone.</p><p>Autumn came suddenly that year, like a door opening. One morning I was bicycling to class when a large flock of Canada geese passed overhead. I couldn&#x2019;t see them, or much of anything else, but I heard the jazzy honking above me. There was a tule fog off the fields and I was wrapped inside it, pedaling through clouds. Tule fogs are not like other fogs, not spotty or drifting, but fixed and substantial. Probably anyone would have felt the risk of moving quickly through an unseen world, but I have&#x2014;or had as a child&#x2014;a particular penchant for slapstick and mishap, so I took the full thrill from it.</p><p>I felt polished by the wet air and maybe just a little migratory myself, just a little wild. This meant I might flirt a bit in the library if I sat next to anyone flirtable or I might daydream in class. I often felt wild back then; I enjoyed the feeling, but nothing had ever come of it.</p><p>At lunchtime I grabbed something, probably grilled cheese, let&#x2019;s say it was grilled cheese, in the school cafeteria. I was in the habit of leaving my books on the chair next to me, where they could be quickly moved if someone interesting came by but would discourage the uninteresting. At twenty-two, I had the callowest possible definition of interesting and, by the measure of my own calipers, was far from interesting myself.</p><p>A couple was sitting at a table near me and the girl&#x2019;s voice gradually rose to the point where I was forced to pay attention. &#x201c;You want some fucking space?&#x201d; she said. She was wearing a short blue T-shirt and a necklace with a glass pendant of an angelfish. Long, dark hair fell in a messy braid down her back. She stood and cleared the table with one motion of her arm. She had beautiful biceps; I remember wishing I had arms like hers.</p><p>Dishes fell to the floor and shattered; catsup and cola spilled and mixed in the breakage. There must have been music in the background, because there&#x2019;s always music in the background now, our whole lives sound-tracked (and most of it too ironic to be random. I&#x2019;m just saying), but honestly I don&#x2019;t remember. Maybe there was only a sweet silence and the spit of grease on the grill.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; the girl asked. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me to be quiet. I&#x2019;m just making more space for you.&#x201d; She pushed the table itself over, swung it to one side, dropped it. &#x201c;Better?&#x201d; She raised her voice. &#x201c;Can everyone please leave the room so my boyfriend has more space? He needs a fucking lot of space.&#x201d; She slammed her chair down onto the pile of catsup and dishes. More sounds of breakage and a sudden waft of coffee.</p><p>The rest of us were frozen&#x2014;forks halfway to our mouths, spoons dipped in our soups, the way people were found after the eruption of Vesuvius.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do this, baby,&#x201d; her boyfriend said once, but she was doing it and he didn&#x2019;t bother to repeat himself. She moved to another table, empty except for a tray with dirty dishes. There, she methodically broke everything that could be broken, threw everything that could be thrown. A saltshaker spun across the floor to my foot.</p><p>A young man rose from his seat, telling her, with a slight stutter, to take a chill pill. She threw a spoon that bounced audibly off his forehead. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t side with assholes,&#x201d; she said. Her voice was very not chill.</p><p>He sank back, eyes wide. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; he assured the room at large, but he sounded unconvinced. And then surprised. &#x201c;Holy shit! I&#x2019;ve been assaulted.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is just the shit I can&#x2019;t take,&#x201d; the boyfriend said. He was a big guy, with a thin face, loose jeans, and a long coat. Nose like a knife. &#x201c;You go ahead and tear it up, you psycho bitch. Just give me back the key to my place first.&#x201d;</p><p>She swung another chair, missing my head by maybe four feet&#x2014;I&#x2019;m being charitable; it seemed like a lot less&#x2014;striking my table and upsetting it. I grabbed my glass and plate. My books hit the floor with a loud slap. &#x201c;Come and get it,&#x201d; she told him.</p><p>It struck me funny, a cook&#x2019;s invitation over a pile of broken plates, and I laughed once, convulsively, a strange duck-like hoot that made everyone turn. And then I stopped laughing, because it was no laughing matter, and everyone turned back. Through the glass walls I could see some people on the quad who&#x2019;d noticed the commotion and were watching. A threesome on their way in for lunch stopped short at the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He took a few steps in her direction. She scooped up a handful of catsup-stained sugar cubes and threw them.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m finished,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re finished. I&#x2019;m putting your shit in the hallway and I&#x2019;m changing the locks.&#x201d; He turned and she threw a glass, which bounced off his ear. He missed a step, staggered, touched the spot with one hand, checked his fingers for blood. &#x201c;You owe me for gas,&#x201d; he said without looking back. &#x201c;Mail it.&#x201d; And he was gone.</p><p>There was a moment&#x2019;s pause as the door closed. Then the girl turned on the rest of us. &#x201c;What are you losers looking at?&#x201d; She picked up one of the chairs and I couldn&#x2019;t tell if she was going to put it back or throw it. I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;d decided.</p><p>A campus policeman arrived. He approached me cautiously, hand on his holster. Me! Standing above my toppled table and chair, still holding my harmless glass of milk and my plate with the harmless half-eaten grilled cheese sandwich. &#x201c;Just put it down, honey,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and sit for a minute.&#x201d; Put it down where? Sit where? Nothing in my vicinity was upright but me. &#x201c;We can talk about this. You can tell me what&#x2019;s going on. You&#x2019;re not in any trouble yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not her,&#x201d; the woman behind the counter told him. She was a large woman, and old&#x2014;forty or more&#x2014;with a beauty mark on her upper lip and eyeliner collecting in the corners of her eyes. You all act like you own the place, she&#x2019;d said to me once, on another occasion, when I sent back a burger for more cooking. But you just come and go. You don&#x2019;t even think how I&#x2019;m the one who stays.</p><p>&#x201c;The tall one,&#x201d; she told the cop. She pointed, but he was paying no attention, so intent on me and whatever my next move would be.</p><p>&#x201c;Calm down,&#x201d; he said again, soft and friendly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not in any trouble yet.&#x201d; He stepped forward, passing right by the girl with the braid and the chair. I saw her eyes behind his shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Never a policeman when you need one,&#x201d; she said to me. She smiled and it was a nice smile. Big white teeth. &#x201c;No rest for the wicked.&#x201d; She hoisted the chair over her head. &#x201c;No soup for you.&#x201d; She launched it away from me and the cop, toward the door. It landed on its back.</p><p>When the policeman turned to look, I dropped my plate and my fork. I honestly didn&#x2019;t mean to. The fingers of my left hand just unclenched all of a sudden. The noise spun the cop back to me.</p><p>I was still holding my glass, half full of milk. I raised it a little, as if proposing a toast. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it,&#x201d; he said, a whole lot less friendly now. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not playing around here. Don&#x2019;t you fucking test me.&#x201d;</p><p>And I threw the glass onto the floor. It broke and splashed milk over one of my shoes and up into my sock. I didn&#x2019;t just let it go. I threw that glass down as hard as I could.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>FORTY MINUTES LATER, the psycho bitch and I were tucked like ticks into the back of a Yolo County police car, the matter now being way too big for the guileless campus cops. Handcuffed, too, which hurt my wrists a great deal more than I&#x2019;d ever imagined it would.</p><p>Being arrested had seriously improved the woman&#x2019;s mood. &#x201c;I <i>told</i> him I wasn&#x2019;t fucking around,&#x201d; she said, which was almost exactly what the campus cop had also said to me, only more in sorrow than in triumph. &#x201c;So glad you decided to come with. I&#x2019;m Harlow Fielding. Drama department.&#x201d;</p><p>No shit.</p><p>&#x201c;I never met a Harlow before,&#x201d; I said. I meant a first name Harlow. I&#x2019;d met a last name Harlow.</p><p>&#x201c;Named after my mother, who was named after Jean Harlow. Because Jean Harlow had beauty <i>and</i> brains and <i>not</i> because Gramps was a dirty old man. Not even. But what good did beauty and brains do her? I ask you. Like she&#x2019;s this great role model?&#x201d;</p><p>I knew nothing about Jean Harlow except that she was maybe in <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, which I&#x2019;d never seen nor ever wanted to see. That war is over. Get over it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Rosemary Cooke.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rosemary for remembrance,&#x201d; Harlow said. &#x201c;Awesome. Totally, totally charmed.&#x201d; She slid her arms under her butt and then under her legs so her cuffed wrists ended up twisted in front of her. If I&#x2019;d been able to do the same, we could have shaken hands, as seemed to be her intention, but I couldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>We were taken then to the county jail, where this same maneuver created a sensation. A number of policemen were called to watch as Harlow obligingly squatted and stepped over her cuffed hands and back again several times. She deflected their enthusiasm with a winning modesty. &#x201c;I have very long arms,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I can never find sleeves that fit.&#x201d;</p><p>Our arresting officer&#x2019;s name was Arnie Haddick. When Officer Haddick took off his hat, his hair was receding from his forehead in a clean, round curve that left his features nicely uncluttered, like a happy face.</p><p>He removed our cuffs and turned us over to ...</p></p><h2>Transformers: Rescue Bots: Meet Boulder the Construction-Bot (Passport to Reading)</h2><p>Meet BOULDER!

InThe Clitoral Truth, Chalker offers the only mainstream, in-depth exploration devoted solely to women&#39;s genital anatomy and sexual response. Women readers everywhere-be they straight, gay, or bisexual-will learn about the countless sexual sensations and discover how to enhance their sexual responses in a more concrete way than ever before.The Clitoral Truthalso examines the ways in which women are enhancing their sexual response through masturbation, the use of sex toys, videos, books, workshops, individual coaching sessions, and the Internet.For more than 2,500 years, the clitoris and the penis were presumed to be equivalent in all respects. After the 18th century, however, this knowledge was gradually suppressed and forgotten, and the definition of the clitoris as an extensive organ system all but disappeared. During Chalker&#39;s tenure as a member of the Federation of Feminist Women&#39;s Health Centers, the group helped further the study of the clitoris to unprecedented anatomic precision.The Clitoral Truthinvestigates every aspect of this magnificent organ to see how its many parts work together to produce orgasms.The Clitoral Truthalso delves into the feminist and sexologist controversy over female ejaculation and surveys the numerous ways that women have begun to transform the deeply entrenched male-centered model of sexuality to redefine their sexuality to emphasize full-body pleasure. Enhanced with personal accounts, comprehensive illustrations, and a thorough appendix of female sexuality resources, this book helps women and their partners understand and expand their sexual potential and work toward becoming independent sexual beings</p><p>REBECCA CHALKER is the author of The Clitoral Truth: The Secret World At Your Fingertips and A Woman&#39;s Book of Choices.

In many ways, she has. Beautiful family. Thriving career. Supportive friendship. Loving marriage. But she&#x2019;s no stranger to adversity. Many know of the strength she had shown after her son, Wade, was killed in a freak car accident when he was only sixteen years old. She would exhibit this remarkable grace and courage again when the very private matter of her husband's infidelity became public fodder. And her own life has been on the line. Days before the 2004 presidential election&#x2014;when her husband John was running for vice president&#x2014;she was diagnosed with breast cancer. After rounds of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation the cancer went away&#x2014;only to reoccur in 2007. <br><br>While on the campaign trail, Elizabeth met many others who have had to contend with serious adversity in their lives, and in <i>Resilience</i>, she draws on their experiences as well as her own, crafting an unsentimental and ultimately inspirational meditation on the gifts we can find among life&#x2019;s biggest challenges.

She lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina with her two youngest children and husband, John.Elizabeth Edwards presents a revealing autobiography and useful book of advice. She&#39;s been through more than her share of difficulties, so her words are wise and worth heeding. Even better, she narrates her story herself. Her voice is fragile and delicate but also intimate and intelligent, qualities that subtly enhance the reading. She moves back and forth in time, sharing how she coped with her cancer, her mother&#39;s Alzheimer&#39;s, and her son&#39;s death at age 16. Only at the end of the book does she reveal that there will be no details about her husband&#39;s affair. She movingly never names his paramour, instead calling her &#34;that woman.&#34; Throughout, Edwards sounds like she&#39;s sharing her thoughts with a treasured friend.

They could be used to carry heavy loads in shallow streams but were light enough to be hauled long distances over land. Built with Stone Age tools from available materials, their design, size, and appearance were varied to suit the many requirements of their users. Upon arrival in North America, European settlers began using the native-made craft for traveling through the wilderness. Even today, canoes are based on these ancient designs. This fascinating guide combines historical background with instructions for constructing one. Author Edwin Tappan Adney, born in 1868, devoted his life to studying canoes and was practically the sole scholar in his field. His papers and research have been assembled by a curator at the Smithsonian Institution, and illustrated with black-and-white line drawings, diagrams, and photos.<br><br>Included here are measurements, detailed drawings, construction methods, and models.

Alone among the big piano companies, Steinway still crafts all of its pianos largely by hand, imbuing each one with the promise and burden of its brand. <br><br>In this captivating narrative, James Barron of <i>The New York Times</i> tells the story of one Steinway piano, from raw lumber to finished instrument. Barron follows that brand-new piano--known by its number, K0862--on its eleven-month journey through the Steinway factory, where time-honored manufacturing methods vie with modern-day industrial efficiency. He looks over the shoulders of men and women--some second- and third-generation employees, some recently arrived immigrants--who transform wood and steel into a concert grand. Together, they carry on the traditions begun more than 150 years ago by the immigrants who founded Steinway &amp; Sons--a family that soared to prominence in the music world and, for a while, in New York City's political and economic life. Barron also explores the art and science of developing a piano's timbre and character before its first performance, when the essential question will be answered: Does K0862 live up to the Steinway legend?<br><br>From start to finish, <i>Piano </i>will charm and enlighten music lovers.<br><br></p><p>James Barron is a staff reporter for <i>The New York Times</i>. Over the past twenty-five years, his writing has appeared in virtually every section of the paper and has ranged from breaking coverage of the September 11 attacks and the 2003 New York City blackout to <i>The Gates</i> public art installation in Central Park. An accomplished amateur pianist, he lives in New York City. <br><br>Prelude<br>By These People, in This Place<br>&nbsp;<br>[Image]<br>Steinway No. K0862 on its way to becoming a concert grand<br>&nbsp;<br>The piano being a creation and plaything of men, its story leads us into innumerable biographies; being a boxful of gadgets, the piano has changed through time and improved at ascertainable moments and places. . . . Indeed, for the last century and a half, the piano has been an institution more characteristic than the bathtub--there were pianos in the log cabins of the frontier, but no tubs.<br>&nbsp;<br>--Jacques Barzun<br>&nbsp;<br>Eighty-eight keys, two hundred and forty-some strings, a few pedals, and a case about the size of--yes--a bathtub: every piano has pretty much the same curves outside and the same workings under the lid. But the biography of a piano is the story of many stories. It is the story of the fragile instruments from which all pianos are descended. And it is the story of contrasts. It is the story of nineteenth-century immigrants who struck it rich making pianos, and of more recent immigrants from Europe and Central America who are paid by the hour. It is the story of the family that virtually invented the modern grand piano, of brothers and cousins who drank, who hated the United States, or who dabbled in bulletproof vests and subways and land deals and amusement parks and the earliest automobiles. It is the story of a few workers who have exceptionally good ears and many who have never read a note of music or set foot inside Carnegie Hall. It is the story of men with a passion for motorcycles who have taught themselves snippets of Beethoven and Chopin and of others who tack photographs of Frank Zappa above their workbenches. It is the story of workers who have brought in special radios that receive the audio portion of television broadcasts so they won't miss their talk shows while they drill out the bottoms of keys and shove in tiny lead weights. It is the story of the place where they work, of factory floor camaraderie, of pleasant, unhurried work.<br>&nbsp;<br>This book is the biography of one piano that was made by these people in this place. It is a concert grand that was built at the Steinway &amp; Sons factory in New York City in 2003 and 2004. The main character will not make a sound for months. A big supporting cast--the most experienced workers in a factory with a payroll of 450--will fuss over it and fume at it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like all Steinways, that main character goes by a number, not a name: K0862. Like all other newborns, K0862 comes with hopes for greatness and with fears that it may not measure up to the distinguished family name it wears, and not bashfully. On its right arm the Steinway name is stenciled in big gold letters that an audience cannot miss; on its cast-iron frame the name is stamped in black letters that a camera closing on the pianist's face cannot miss. There is no mistaking K0862 for a Baldwin or a Yamaha or a B�sendorfer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet K0862 looks just like every other Steinway concert grand. It is eight feet, eleven and three-quarters inches long. It contains the same bewildering assortment of moving parts, thousands of tiny pieces of wood and felt and metal that bend and twist and rise and fall on command. <br>&nbsp;<br>Pianists always say that a good piano has "personality," but the workers know that a piano is a machine, or the eighteenth century's idea of one. Talented tinkerers refined it later on--improvisational wizards of hand tools who, little by little, made a good thing stronger, tougher, and, above all, enduring. But the piano remained an invention from an earlier time. Nineteenth-century inventions had mechanized guts and world-changing goals, like doing in an hour what human hands took days to do. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, Eli Whitney had invented the cotton gin. In the middle of the nineteenth century, Robert Fulton made his steamboat, Cyrus McCormick his reaper, and Isaac Merrit Singer his sewing machine. No one would say that a sewing machine has a personality. It is just a machine.<br>&nbsp;<br>What a different machine is a piano: a machine with emotions, if that is possible, or at least emotional attachments. There are pianists who kiss their pianos every day, who touch the case as tenderly as they would touch a lover's cheek, who talk to their pianos in a way they talk to no one. Musicians regularly talk about the individual characteristics of this or that piano, the traits that make one a pleasure to play and the one next to it an agonizing slog. They dream of one that can deliver what Beethoven's pupil Carl Czerny called a "holy, distant and celestial Harmony."<br>&nbsp;<br>Even before its first note sounds, the question hanging over K0862 is the question that hangs over every Steinway: How good is it? Will it be a lemon or the piano-world version of a zero-to-sixty delight? Will it sound like celestial harmony or "a squadron of dive bombers," as the pianist Gary Graffman said of a Steinway he hated on first hearing (but came to love)? Will it surprise the Bach specialist Angela Hewitt, who considers Steinways made in New York to be "powerful but rather strident, and in my opinion, clumsy"? Will it match the piano that was the onstage favorite of Rachmaninoff and later Horowitz and, after retiring from concert life, became the living room piano in Eugene Istomin's apartment? Will it be anything like the piano that Van Cliburn discovered during a late-night practice session before a concert in Philadelphia? That piano so captivated him that he offered to buy it then and there. Steinway told him to wait--it was booked for at least nine months. He waited, and took it home in February 1990.<br>&nbsp;<br>Will K0862 be good enough for a place in Steinway's stable of concert pianos, the three hundred or so instruments that dominate the nation's concert stages and recording studios? Will it be good enough to spend five years on a very fast track with a different rider every night?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A Steinway's life begins far from center stage, in the gritty complex of red-brick factory buildings that was laid out when Ulysses S. Grant was president. The factory is dingy, just as it always was. At quitting time, the workers track sawdust home on their shoes, just as they always have. Many of the machines are older than the men who operate them--and most of the workers at Steinway are men. The factory floors are so worn that everyone has memorized where the dips are. If they open the grimy back windows, the workers can watch the airplanes taxi into position, nose to tail, at La Guardia Airport, on land that the Steinways once owned. A real estate ad would note that the factory has "partial rvr vus"--a narrow channel leading to the East River is just beyond the runways. Something a real estate ad would not mention is that New York City's largest jail is on an island a quarter of a mile from the shore.<br>&nbsp;<br>The windows on the other side of the factory look toward Manhattan, a few miles away. Just inside those windows are the workbenches of the bellymen, called that because the only way to do their work is to climb inside a piano on their stomachs. The bellymen talk about how they watched the twin towers of the World Trade Center burn and collapse on the morning of the 9/11 attacks. The bellymen remember it as one of the few days when the world beyond their windows intruded on the timelessness of the factory.<br>&nbsp;<br>In so many ways, the factory is a dusty leftover from the days before computers, televisions, even recordings--scratchy old 78s, not compact discs or MP3 downloads. It is nothing like the huge television soundstages that have filled the shells of old factories a few miles away, or the art galleries that have taken over other old industrial buildings. Nor is this the world of pristine white rooms and bright lights and smooth surfaces and the ultramodern machinery that turns out computers. This plant remains rooted in a world that was. Old etchings combined this factory with a second Steinway plant a mile away, as if a composite image would be more impressive. The other factory has been turned into pricey condominium apartments.<br>&nbsp;<br>The piano factory that still is a piano factory still has the shadowy old workrooms. And it still sends its products off to a life of white tie and tails in some of the swankiest concert halls in the world. The hands that will eventually touch K0862--the hands of the pianists who will play it--could not be more different from the hands that will build it and shape its character, its personality. These hands are calloused and chapped and cut, and there is dirt and grease under these fingernails--most of them, anyway. One worker, a woman, has half-inch-long painted nails.<br>&nbsp;<br>These hands will shape, spray-paint, polish, and tune K0862, and then work on it some more. K0862's wooden parts will be aged in a room as dim as a wine cellar. Its 340-pound iron plate will be lowered in and lifted out ten or twelve times. It will spend long hours in rooms where workers wear oxygen masks to avoid getting headaches, or getting high, from smelly glues. It will be broken in by a machine that plays scales without complaint, unlike a student.<br>&nbsp;<br>Someone walking through the factory, following a single piano as it takes shape, could forget a basic fact: Every Steinway is made the same way, from the same materials, by the same workers. Yet every Steinway ends up being different from every other--not in appearance, perhaps, but in ways that are not easily put into words: colorations of sound, nuances of strength or delicacy, what many pianists call--here's that word again--personality. Some Steinways end up sounding small and mellow, which is fine for chamber music. Some are so big and muscular and percussive that a full-strength orchestra cannot drown them out. On some, the keys move with little effort. On others, the pianist's hands and arms get a workout.<br>&nbsp;<br>Why is one piano different from another? No one really knows.<br>&nbsp;<br>In its first fifty years, Steinway made nearly one hundred thousand pianos (99,517 to be exact; No. 100,000, delivered to the White House in 1903, is now at the Smithsonian Institution). The next thirty-five years were Steinway's busiest. It made two hundred thousand pianos. No. 300,000, the Steinway that is still in the East Room, was delivered in 1938.<br>&nbsp;<br>K0862 will be built the way those ancestors were built. The process is labor-intensive and has not changed much over the years. Nor has the design. Planned obsolescence is not a concept that came to the piano industry the way it came to the powerhouses of the twentieth century that made cars and refrigerators and rubber boots. The wood in a piano does not rust or rot, and a sounding board can last seventy or eighty years, or maybe longer. There is very little to keep a piano from functioning long after it has been paid for, long after it has been passed on to the next generation, or the next. There are no annual model changes. The basic design of concert grands like K0862--their shape, their length, the layout of their strings--has gone unchanged since the 1890s. Steinway's newest model, a baby grand almost four feet shorter than K0862, has been on the market since the 1930s.<br>&nbsp;<br>K0862 and the pianos next to it on the factory floor are products of one of the last outposts of hand craftsmanship in what was once a boomtown for piano makers. Steinway outlasted rivals like Sohmer and Weber, as well as apparel makers who turned to lower-wage factories in Asia and printers who turned to newer, automated plants in the South. Just by staying put, Steinway became one of the last large manufacturing operations in New York City, which lost 666,400 factory jobs between 1962 and the end of 2002. Nowadays, the city's largest factories bake cookies and squirt soft drinks into cans and bottles that are made elsewhere, and Steinway is a relatively small concern in an industry dominated by foreign giants that can turn out as many pianos in a day as Steinway makes in a month. Some of Steinway's competitors also make everything from guitars to motorcycles to stereo components. But Steinway, for most of the twentieth century, remained focused on its pianos.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the Steinway factory was new, barges loaded with raw lumber docked at the edge of the eleven-acre compound, and the company operated its own foundry to make the cast-iron plates it had patented. Anywhere but in New York City, a 440,000-square-foot factory like Steinway's would be horizontal, a sprawling single-story wonder. There would be no need to make appointments for the freight elevators to haul the pianos from floor to floor, as foremen do at Steinway. There might be mechanical booms to lower the cast-iron plate into the rim, instead of the heavily muscled arms and hand-cranked winches at Steinway. But this factory is a warren of interconnected structures, of bare fluorescent lights hanging from the ceiling, of workrooms where a mouse occasionally darts across the floor. It is a place where the day is paced according to the company's union contract, where workers sometimes spend their two fifteen-minute breaks napping on a storage shelf the size of a Ping-Pong table.<br>&nbsp;<br>Once, the youngest workers were sent to a nearby bar on Friday afternoons to fetch buckets of beer. Fridays have been dry for years, but the timelessness of the factory remains. As Joe Gurrado, a foreman, says when showing off World War I-era photographs of Steinway workers, "The only thing you'd have to change is the clothing on those guys."<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the years, the Steinways sold most of their land, and in 1972 they sold the company itself. But their name remains on Steinway Street, and the company wraps itself in its history. Its high-ceilinged showroom in Manhattan is filled with outsized paintings of the nineteenth-century matinee idol Ignace Jan Paderewski and busts of Franz Liszt and Sergei Rachmaninoff, and the company boasts that it produces "the instrument of the immortals." K0862 has a long way to go before it reaches the world beyond the factory, the world of concert stages, finicky impresarios, tantrum-throwing performers, dour critics, and perfection-minded tuners. This is its story.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2006 by James Barron</p><h2>The Demon in the Teahouse (The Samurai Mysteries)</h2><p>The beautiful, mysterious women of Japan are being killed one by one.

Based on a real character in 18th-century Japan who was known for his reasoning and his ability to solve crimes, the man comes up with a plan. He strategically places his adopted son, 14-year-old Seikei, in a teahouse frequented by a popular geisha who seems to have some connection to both the fires and the murders, and he tells him to keep his eyes open. Conscientious and clever, Seikei quickly finds a number of clues, but in the process is accused of setting a fire. In and out of trouble, this feisty boy, whose greatest desire is to become a samurai, is almost killed, but in the end, he solves the mystery and learns a bit about what Bunzo, his instructor, told him in the beginning: "A samurai must possess the way of the warrior." This sequel to The Ghost in the Tokaido Inn (Philomel, 1999) is a fast-paced mystery with a well-constructed plot that moves quickly and often in dramatic ways. Seikei is a likable hero, a believable detective who encounters characters of all types who add to the rousing adventure and suspense.</p><p><i>Barbara Scotto, Michael Driscoll School, Brookline, MA</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Jeannie Out of the Bottle</h2><p><b><br>A magical, heartwarming memoir from one of Hollywood&#x2019;s most beloved icons</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Over the past four decades, the landmark NBC hit television series <i>I Dream of Jeannie </i>has delighted generations of audiences and inspired untold numbers of teenage crushes on its beautiful blond star, Barbara Eden.

The mermaid reminds me of Dolfina, the famous "Girl in the Fishbowl" always on display at the Bal Tabarin restaurant on Market Street, where my parents often used to bring me when I was very young, simply because they couldn't afford a babysitter and had to cart me everywhere with them.<br><br>In those far-off years during the Depression, however poor my parents were, they still hadn't forgotten how to love, how to laugh, and how to dream. They were young and carefree, spent every penny my father earned from his job as a telephone lineman, and understood exactly how to have fun.<br><br>At the time, long before my younger sister, Alison, was born, I was my mother's "onliest only," as she called me then, and would until her dying day. Like many an only child, I was probably grown-up before my time, and those nights at the Bal Tabarin (which later became Bimbo's 365 Club), where Rita Hayworth danced in the chorus and Ann Miller was discovered dancing when she was just thirteen, only served to make me more mature and at the same time give me an early love of show business.<br><br>So did seeing Bob Hope perform live onstage when I was just four years old. My mother and father took me to his show at a local theater, and I remember how joyful watching Bob made me feel. Little did I know that when I grew up, I would meet him, we'd become friends, and I'd appear onstage with him many, many times myself.<br><br>When I was a small child, my dream was to be not an actress but a singer. Each night, when I did the dishes with my mother, Alice, she sang Gilbert and Sullivan ditties or tunes from her father's favorite Irish operetta, Bohemian Girl, and I joined in. I developed a passion for singing early on in my childhood, which was only further heightened when I sang in the church choir every Sunday.<br><br>At the same time, fishing on Fisherman's Wharf with my father (although the sight of fishermen gutting their fish put me off fish for life-to this day I never eat it), roller-skating along the wharf, and bicyling in Golden Gate Park with him all contributed to making me a bit of a tomboy (which, by the way, I always thought Jeannie was as well).<br><br>I've always considered myself a California girl and have been proud of it, but in reality I was born in Tuscon, Arizona. And I always relished looking back at my mother's family history and reconstructing exactly how I ended up being born there.<br><br>I still have a remarkable letter she gave to me, which was originally bequeathed to her by her mother. It was written in 1856 by my great-great-great-grandfather, John A. Bills, to my great-great- grandparents, Bilista and William Long, after they were forced to leave New York State and go west because William, a house-painter, was dying of lead poisoning. If I could have, I would have framed it, but it is too old and too fragile, so I keep it in an acid-free envelope. All in all, I think it's a fascinating historical document (but if you don't, just skip it).<br><br>Ramsey, Illinois 28 Nov. 1856<br><br>Dear Daughter,<br><br>We rec'd your letter a few days ago and hasten to answer. We were sorry to hear that William was so feeble although it was not all together unexpected. He has been so long sick that we sometimes almost believed that thought he might at last recover-but we feel that even this letter may find you a widow and the children orphans-I sometimes feel as though you would be doubly afflicted situated as you are a stranger almost in a far off country-but it seem you are not discouraged or cast down entirely. We really hope a way will be provided for you and the little ones. Do you still feel that you had rather stay there or would you like to come back and live among your old acquaintances and friends once more.<br><br>We have sold out all our things in Troy and moved to the west. We are on a farm in a town called Ramsey it is on the Illinois South Central Railroad. As far south nearly as St. Louis. We have a very nice farm of 1110 acres and so far like it much. Gardner and George are here with us and John in Vandalia 13 miles south of us to work at his trade (dentist).

Daniel is a carman, Uncle Luis and Nathan are in -- on their old places all well. Allen and Ester lived in Albany when we came away-have not heard from them since.<br><br>I had a letter from Mrs. Harlow sometime since they live in Oroville and she seems to think that they are getting rich again- I hope they may. I suppose Mrs. Alfred Smith is out there as she has sold all her furniture and was calculating to go in a few days when we left Troy the first of July-is she there and what are they about. I wish we could run in and see you and help you in your time of need-but we are a great way apart and it is not likely that I shall ever go to California again-if we had Mary &amp; Willie home we could give them a good chance for school and bread and milk-We have two good cows and make plenty of butter and have lots of cream and milk to eat and use-I suppose they are great children now and hope they are and always will be good children and do all they can to help their mother through life.<br><br>Now Bilista I should like to know how you are situated to get a living- can you earn enough to make yourself and children comfortable-do you intend to stay there and work and do all you can to make a living or do you sometimes wish you was back again-I wish you would write me as to how you feel about it-We think this is a good and healthy country- My health and your mother's is much better than it was in Troy and so far we are not sorry we moved-Please write soon and often and we will write often now that we are settled down once more-Give our respects to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith if she is there-and finally give our respects to all our old acquaintances if you see any of them.<br><br>Goodbye and may the Lord give you strength to endure whatever you may be called to go through.<br><br>Direct your letter "John A Bills, Ramsey-Fayette Co Illinois."<br><br>Your Father John A Bills<br><br>Mrs. Bilista A Long San Francisco Cal<br><br>The Mary mentioned in the letter was my great-grandmother, Mary Dorothea Long, who came west in the covered wagon with her parents, Bilista and William Long, when she was only four years old.

When he was a child during the potato famine, his parents, hoping to save his life, put him on a ship bound for the New World. That ship turned out to be one of the "coffin boats," so named because so many children who sailed on them died of starvation or disease during the harsh and unforgiving Atlantic crossing.<br><br>Richard O'Leary was one of the lucky ones; he survived. At fifteen years old, still unable to read and write, he took a job building the transcontinental railroad and ended up in Marysville, California, where he met a priest and confided to him that he wanted a wife.<br><br>The priest relayed that information to my great-grandmother, Mary, who thought about it for a bit, then informed the priest, "I'll walk out with him." So that's what she did, for just one week, at the end of which she announced to the priest, "I'll marry him," and did.<br><br>She went on to teach my great-grandfather to read and write, and had nine children along the way as well, one of whom was my maternal grandmother, Frances Elvira O'Leary, who was born in Nevada and went to school there.<br><br>Meanwhile, back east in Pennsylvania, my maternal grandfather-to-be, Charles Benjamin Franklin (a distant relative of the great man himself), the son of an Englishwoman, was orphaned at nine after his parents were killed in a carriage accident.<br><br>On discovering that young Charles had been left alone in the world, his two maternal aunts sailed from England to America, determined to bring him back home to the old country with them. The aunts realized Charles was happy in his new home and allowed my grandfather to stay. However, later, he ran away from home, apprenticed himself to a ship's carpenter, and sailed the seven seas.<br><br>By the time Charles arrived back in America, he had married, divorced, and along the way become an accomplished carpenter, adept at all branches of the trade, including cabinetry. Finally he turned up in Nevada, where he booked into a small boardinghouse. There, one morning, a beautiful young girl-Frances Elvira O'Leary-served him breakfast.<br><br>Although he was entranced by her charms, he nevertheless couldn't help noticing that she kept rubbing her cheek. Without any preamble, he demanded to know why she hadn't seen a dentist. She blushed scarlet and shook her head, whereupon he grabbed her arm and declared, "Whether you like it or not, I'm taking you to one."<br><br>He did, and within months, my grandmother, Frances Elvira O'Leary, married Charles Benjamin Franklin in San Francisco. My mother, Alice, the youngest of four children, was born in El Paso.

BOMC Feat Alt. Reader&#39;s Digest Cond Bks.</p><p>Since The Eagle Has Landed&#x2014;one of the biggest-selling thrillers of all time&#x2014;every novel Jack Higgins has written has become an international bestseller. He has had simultaneous number-one bestsellers in hardcover and paperback, and many of his books have been made into successful movies, including The Eagle Has Landed, To Catch a King, On Dangerous Ground, Eye of the Storm, and Thunder Point. He has degrees in sociology, social psychology, and economics from the University of London, and a doctorate in media from Leeds Metropolitan University. A fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and an expert scuba diver and marksman, Higgins lives in Jersey on the Channel Islands.A world-class assassin goes after British PM John Major in Higgins's latest firmly engaging round of speculative derring-do. The Day of the Jackal this isn't, although Sean Dillon--a rogue IRA hit-man who's also a master thespian--is nearly as charismatic a killer as Forsyth's Jackal; and the author's own The Eagle Has Landed it isn't quite either, though Higgins, a diligent literary recycler, revives the spirit, pacing, and even one major player from that 1975 classic. This is the vigorous, rather simple tale of what might have been behind the real-life, still unexplained, mortar attack on Number Ten Downing Street on February 7, 1991. Here, Saddam Hussein, reeling under the allied bombing of Baghdad, asks oily Iraqi billionaire Michael Aroun to avenge Iraqi honor, which Aroun does by joining forces with Stalinist KGB Colonel Josef Makeev and hiring Dillon to blow away Margaret Thatcher, now visiting in France. When Dillon is betrayed by two hirelings and misses his shot at the Iron Lady, he ups the stakes- -why not, he proposes, go after the current PM (here, a most charming chap) and in fact the entire British War Cabinet? Using his Olivier-like powers to pose as several characters, including a bag-lady, and aided by a sexy KGB spy, Dillon sneaks into England, then Ireland, contacts old criminal/IRA pals, and plans. Arrayed against him in an ever-more suspenseful chase are several stalwart British agents, male and female, and two ex-IRA men, including Liam Devlin of Eagle fame. The mortar attack itself has about as much dramatic impact as a hiccup, but Higgins saves his big melodrama for Dillon's attempted escape--which will leave readers happily breathless and waiting for a sequel. The action's so fast, the heroes so valiant, and the villains so blackhearted that not even Higgins's syntax-crunching prose will keep his fans from driving this--his most enjoyable book in years- -up the charts.

Through that observation, astronomers could calculate the size of the solar system&#x2014;but only if they could compile data from many different points of the globe, all recorded during the short period of the transit. Overcoming incredible odds and political strife, astronomers from Britain, France, Russia, Germany, Sweden, and the American colonies set up observatories in remote corners of the world, only to have their efforts thwarted by unpredictable weather and warring armies. Fortunately, transits of Venus occur in pairs: eight years later, the scientists would have another opportunity to succeed.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chasing Venus</i> brings to life the personalities of the eighteenth-century astronomers who embarked upon this complex and essential scientific venture, painting a vivid portrait of the collaborations, the rivalries, and the volatile international politics that hindered them at every turn.

She is the brightest star in the night sky and visible even on a clear day. Some saw her as the harbinger of morning and evening, of new seasons or portentous times. She reigns as the &#x2018;Morning Star&#x2019; or the &#x2018;Bringer of Light&#x2019; for 260 days, and then disappears to rise again as the &#x2018;Evening Star&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Bringer of Dawn&#x2019;. <br> &nbsp;<br> Venus has inspired people for centuries, but in the 1760s astronomers believed that the planet held the answer to one of the biggest questions in science &#x2013; she was the key to under�standing the size of the solar system. <br> &nbsp;<br> In 1716 British astronomer Edmond Halley published a ten-page essay which called upon scientists to unite in a project spanning the entire globe &#x2013; one that would change the world of science forever. On 6 June 1761, Halley predicted, Venus would traverse the face of the sun &#x2013; for a few hours the bright star would appear as a perfectly black circle. He believed that measuring the exact time and duration of this rare celestial encounter would provide the data that astrono�mers needed in order to calculate the distance between the earth and the sun. <br> &nbsp;<br> The only problem was that the so-called transit of Venus is one of the rarest predictable astronomical events. Transits always arrive in pairs &#x2013; eight years apart &#x2013; but with an interval of more than a century before they are then seen again. Only once before, Halley said, in 1639, had an astronomer called Jeremiah Horrocks observed the event. The next pair would occur in 1761 and 1769 &#x2013; and then again in 1874 and 1882. <br> &nbsp;<br> Halley was sixty years old when he wrote his essay and knew that he would not live to see the transit (unless he reached the age of 104), but he wanted to ensure that the next generation would be fully prepared. Writing in the journal of the Royal Society, the most important scientific institution in Britain, Halley explained exactly why the event was so important, what these &#x2018;young Astronomers&#x2019; had to do, and where they should view it. By choosing to write in Latin, the international language of science, he hoped to increase the chances of astronomers from across Europe acting upon his idea. The more people he reached, the greater the chance of success. It was essential, Halley explained, that several people at different locations across the globe should measure the rare heavenly rendezvous at the same time. It was not enough to see Venus&#x2019;s march from Europe alone; astronomers would have to travel to remote locations in both the northern and southern hemispheres to be as far apart as possible. And only if they combined these results &#x2013; the northern viewings being the counterpart to the southern obser�vations &#x2013; could they achieve what had hitherto been almost unimaginable: a precise mathematical understanding of the dimensions of the solar system, the holy grail of astronomy. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Halley&#x2019;s request would be answered when hundreds of astronomers joined in the transit project. They came together in the spirit of the Enlightenment. The race to observe and measure the transit of Venus was a pivotal moment in a new era &#x2013; one in which man tried to understand nature through the application of reason. <br> &nbsp;<br> This was a century in which science was worshipped, and myth at last conquered by rational thought. Man began to order the world according to these new principles. The Frenchman Denis Diderot, for example, was amassing all available knowl�edge for his monumental <i>Encyclop�die</i>. The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus classified plants according to their sexual organs, and in 1751 Samuel Johnson imposed order upon language when he had compiled the first English dictionary. As new inventions such as microscopes and telescopes opened up previ�ously unknown worlds, scientists were able to zoom in on the minutiae of life and gaze into infinity. Robert Hooke had peered through his microscope to produce detailed engravings of magni�fied seeds, fleas and worms &#x2013; he was the first to call the basic unit of biological life a &#x2018;cell&#x2019;. In the North American colonies Benjamin Franklin was experimenting with electricity and light�ning rods, controlling what until then had been regarded as manifestations of divine fury. Slowly the workings of nature became clearer. Comets were no longer viewed as portents of God&#x2019;s wrath but, as Halley had shown, predictable celestial occurrences. In 1755 the German philosopher Immanuel Kant suggested that the universe was much larger than his contem�poraries believed and that it consisted of uncountable and gigantic &#x2018;<i>Welteninseln</i>&#x2019; &#x2013; &#x2018;cosmic islands&#x2019;, or galaxies. <br> &nbsp;<br> Humankind believed it was marching along a trajectory of progress. Scientific societies were founded in London, Paris, Stockholm, St Petersburg, and in the North American colonies in Philadelphia, to explore and exchange this new-found knowl�edge. Observation, enquiry and experimentation were the building blocks of this new understanding of the world. With progress as the leading light of the century, every generation envied the next. Whereas the Renaissance had looked back upon the past as the Golden Age, the Enlightenment looked firmly to the future. <br> &nbsp;<br> Halley&#x2019;s idea of using the transit of Venus as a tool to measure the heavens was born out of developments in astronomy over the previous century. Until the early seventeenth century man had observed the sky with his naked eye, but technology was slowly catching up with the reach of his ambitions and theories. Astronomy had changed from a science which mapped stars to one which sought to understand the motion of planetary bodies. In the early sixteenth century Nicolaus Copernicus had proposed the revolutionary idea of the solar system with the sun rather than the earth at the centre, and the other planets moving around it &#x2013; a model that had been expanded and veri�fied by Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler in the early seven�teenth century. But it was Isaac Newton&#x2019;s groundbreaking <i>Principia, </i>in 1687, which had defined the underlying universal laws of motion and gravity that ruled all and everything. As astronomers gazed at the stars, they were no longer in search of God but of the laws governing the universe. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time Halley called upon his fellow astronomers to view the transit of Venus, the universe was regarded as running like a divinely created clockwork according to laws which humankind had only to comprehend and compute. The position and move�ments of planets were no longer seen as ordained arbitrarily by God but as ordered and predictable, and based on natural laws. But man still lacked the knowledge of the actual size of the solar system &#x2013; an essential piece of the celestial jigsaw puzzle. <br> &nbsp;<br> Understanding the dimensions of the heavens had &#x2018;always been a principle object of astronomical inquiry&#x2019;, the American astronomer and Harvard professor John Winthrop said in the transit decade. Already in the early seventeenth century Kepler had discovered that by knowing how long it took for a planet to orbit the sun, the relative distance between the sun and the planet could be calculated (the longer it took a planet to orbit the sun, the further away it was). From this he had been able to work out the distance between the earth and the sun relative to the other planets &#x2013; a unit of measurement that became the basis for calculating comparative distances in the universe.&#x2020; Astronomers knew, for example, that the distance between the earth and Jupiter was five times that of the distance between the earth and the sun. The only problem was that no one had as yet been able to quantify that distance in more specific terms. <br> &nbsp;<br> Eighteenth-century astronomers had a map of the solar system, but no idea of its true size. Without knowing how far the earth really was from the sun, such a map was all but useless. Venus, so Halley believed, was the key to unlocking this secret. As the brightest star in the sky, Venus became the perfect metaphor for the light of reason that would illuminate this new world and extinguish the last vestiges of the Dark Ages. <br> &nbsp;<br> Unlike most astronomers whose lives were ruled by the repeti�tive labour of their nightly observations, Halley had embarked on a far more exciting career &#x2013; which was probably why he could envisage a global army of swashbuckling astronomers. Not only had he spent one and a half hours in a diving bell submerged almost twenty metres deep in the Thames, he had also undertaken three expeditions to the South Atlantic as the first European to map the southern night sky with a telescope. Halley &#x2018;talks, swears, and drinks brandy like a sea captain&#x2019;, a colleague said, but he was also one of the most inspired scien�tists of his age. He had predicted the return of the eponymous Halley&#x2019;s Comet, produced a map of the southern stars and convinced Isaac Newton to publish his <i>Principia</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> Knowing that he would not be alive to orchestrate the global cooperation to view Venus&#x2019;s transit &#x2013; a fact that Halley lamented &#x2018;even on his death-bed&#x2019; whilst holding a glass of wine in his hand &#x2013; all he could do was to place his trust in future genera�tions and hope that they would remember his instructions half a century hence. &#x2018;Indeed I could wish that many observations of this same phenomenon might be taken by different persons at separate places&#x2019;, he wrote. &#x2018;I recommend it therefore, again and again, to those curious Astronomers who (when I am dead) will have an opportunity of observing these things&#x2019;. <br> &nbsp;<br> Halley was asking his future disciples to embark on a project that was bigger and more visionary than any scientific endeavour previously undertaken. The dangerous voyages to remote outposts would take many months, possibly even years. Astronomers would be risking their lives for a celestial event that would last just six hours and be visible only if weather conditions permitted it. The transit would be so short that even the brief appearance of clouds or rain would make accu�rate observations difficult or even impossible. <br> &nbsp;<br> In preparation for it, scientists would need to secure funding for the best telescopes and instruments as well as for travel, accommodation and salaries. They would have to convince their respective monarchs and governments to support their individual efforts and would have to coordinate their own observations with those from other countries. Nations locked in battle would have to work together in the name of science for the first time ever. From many dozens of locations, hundreds of astronomers would have to point their telescopes to the sky at exactly the same moment in order to see Venus&#x2019;s progress across the burning disc of the sun. <br> &nbsp;<br> And perhaps even more challenging still &#x2013; though less exhila�rating &#x2013; they must then share their findings. Each observer would have to add his or her observations to the pool of international data. No single result would be of any use without the others. In order to calculate the distance between the sun and the earth, astronomers would have to compare the figures and consolidate the different data into one definitive result. Timings obtained across the world using a disparate range of clocks and telescopes would somehow have to be standardised and made comparable. <br> &nbsp;<br> The transit of Venus observations were to be the most ambitious scientific project that had ever been planned &#x2013; an extraordinary undertaking in an era when a letter posted in Philadelphia took two to three months to reach London, and when the journey from London to Newcastle was six days. It took a great leap of the imagination to propose that astronomers should travel thousands of miles into the wildernesses far north and south, laden with instruments weighing more than half a ton. <br> &nbsp;<br> Their idea of calculating exact distances in space was a bold concept too, considering that clocks were still not accurate enough to measure longitude precisely, and there was as yet no standardised measurement on Earth: an English mile was a different length from a mile in German-speaking countries &#x2013; which also varied between northern Germany and Austria. A &#x2018;<i>mil</i>&#x2019; in Sweden was more than ten kilometres, in Norway more than eleven, while a French league could be three kilo�metres but also as much as four and a half. In France alone there were 2,000 different units of measurement &#x2013; which varied even between neighbouring villages. In light of this, the idea of merging hundreds of observations taken by astronomers across the world to find one common value seemed outrageously ambitious. <br> &nbsp;<br> The scientists, who were to leave their observatories in the learned centres of Europe to view Venus from remote outposts of the known world, made for strange adventurers too. At first sight they might not have looked like heroic explorers, but as they chased Venus across the globe they did so with extraordinary intrepidity, bravery and ingenuity. On 6 June 1761 and again on 3 June 1769, several hundred astronomers all over the world pointed their telescopes towards the sky to see Venus travel across the sun. They ignored religious, national and economic differences to unite in what was the first global scientific project.

Ehrman's best-selling <em>The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings, 3/e</em>. Retaining the approach of the longer textbook while condensing and simplifying much of its material, this volume looks at the New Testament from a consistently historical and comparative perspective and emphasizes the rich diversity of the earliest Christian literature. Rather than shying away from the critical problems presented by these books, Ehrman addresses the historical and literary challenges they pose. He shows why scholars continue to argue over such significant issues as how the books of the New Testament came into being, what they mean, and how they relate to contemporary Christian and non-Christian literature. Distinctive to this study is its emphasis on the historical, literary, and religious milieu of the Greco-Roman world, including early Judaism. <br> <br> <strong>Features</strong>: <br> * Covers the fundamentals of New Testament scholarship in an engaging style, making challenging material easily understandable to undergraduates in introductory courses <br> * Retains the <strong>numerous pedagogical devices</strong> from the longer textbook: <br> "What to Expect" and "At a Glance" boxes introduce and provide summaries of the material covered in each chapter <br> "Something to Think About" and "Some More Information" boxes offer thought-provoking asides <br> * Adds <strong>new study aids</strong>: <br> <strong>Key Terms</strong> (each appearing in boldface the first time it is used), <strong>Questions for Study and Reflection</strong>, and a <strong>greatly expanded Glossary</strong> <br> * Offers streamlined coverage--this volume is nine chapters shorter than <em>The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament, 3/e</em> <br> * Includes a full-color eight-page insert on archaeology <br> * <strong> A Student Website</strong> contains chapter summaries, guides for reading, and self-quizzes <br><strong>An Instructor's Manual</strong> provides chapter summaries, student reading guides, pedagogical suggestions, and exam questions and answers <br> <br> Ideal for undergraduate and seminary classes in the New Testament, Biblical Studies, and Christian Origins, <em>A Brief Introduction to the New Testament</em> is an accessible, clearly written introduction that encourages students to consider the historical issues surrounding these writings.</p><p>Bart D.

Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane&#x2019;s bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.<br><br>The lieutenant&#x2019;s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he&#x2019;d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails.

In evocative, immediate descriptions, Hillenbrand unfurls the story of Louie Zamperini--a juvenile delinquent-turned-Olympic runner-turned-Army hero. During a routine search mission over the Pacific, Louie&#x2019;s plane crashed into the ocean, and what happened to him over the next three years of his life is a story that will keep you glued to the pages, eagerly awaiting the next turn in the story and fearing it at the same time. You&#x2019;ll cheer for the man who somehow maintained his selfhood and humanity despite the monumental degradations he suffered, and you&#x2019;ll want to share this book with everyone you know.<em> --Juliet Disparte</em> <p><strong>The Story of <em>Unbroken</em> by Laura Hillenbrand</strong></p> <p>Eight years ago, an old man told me a story that took my breath away. His name was Louie Zamperini, and from the day I first spoke to him, his almost incomprehensibly dramatic life was my obsession.</p> <p>It was a horse--the subject of my first book, <em>Seabiscuit: An American Legend</em>--who led me to Louie. As I researched the Depression-era racehorse, I kept coming across stories about Louie, a 1930s track star who endured an amazing odyssey in World War II. I knew only a little about him then, but I couldn&#x2019;t shake him from my mind. After I finished <em>Seabiscuit</em>, I tracked Louie down, called him and asked about his life. For the next hour, he had me transfixed.</p> <p>Growing up in California in the 1920s, Louie was a hellraiser, stealing everything edible that he could carry, staging elaborate pranks, getting in fistfights, and bedeviling the local police. But as a teenager, he emerged as one of the greatest runners America had ever seen, competing at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, where he put on a sensational performance, crossed paths with Hitler, and stole a German flag right off the Reich Chancellery. He was preparing for the 1940 Olympics, and closing in on the fabled four-minute mile, when World War II began. Louie joined the Army Air Corps, becoming a bombardier. Stationed on Oahu, he survived harrowing combat, including an epic air battle that ended when his plane crash-landed, some six hundred holes in its fuselage and half the crew seriously wounded.</p> <p>On a May afternoon in 1943, Louie took off on a search mission for a lost plane. Somewhere over the Pacific, the engines on his bomber failed. The plane plummeted into the sea, leaving Louie and two other men stranded on a tiny raft. Drifting for weeks and thousands of miles, they endured starvation and desperate thirst, sharks that leapt aboard the raft, trying to drag them off, a machine-gun attack from a Japanese bomber, and a typhoon with waves some forty feet high. At last, they spotted an island. As they rowed toward it, unbeknownst to them, a Japanese military boat was lurking nearby. Louie&#x2019;s journey had only just begun.</p> <p>That first conversation with Louie was a pivot point in my life. Fascinated by his experiences, and the mystery of how a man could overcome so much, I began a seven-year journey through his story. I found it in diaries, letters and unpublished memoirs; in the memories of his family and friends, fellow Olympians, former American airmen and Japanese veterans; in forgotten papers in archives as far-flung as Oslo and Canberra. Along the way, there were staggering surprises, and Louie&#x2019;s unlikely, inspiring story came alive for me. It is a tale of daring, defiance, persistence, ingenuity, and the ferocious will of a man who refused to be broken.</p> <p>The culmination of my journey is my new book, <em>Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption</em>. I hope you are as spellbound by Louie&#x2019;s life as I am.</p><b>Laura Hillenbrand</b><i> </i>is the author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Seabiscuit: An American Legend, </i>which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, won the Book Sense Book of the Year Award and the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award, landed on more than fifteen best-of-the-year lists, and inspired the film <i>Seabiscuit, </i>which was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

For the Greeks, self-knowledge and identity were the basics of their civilization and their sources were to be found in where one was born and into which social group. These determined who you were and what your duties were. In this book the independent scholar Ingrid Rossellini surveys the major ideas that, from Greek and Roman antiquity through the Christian medieval era up to the dawn of modernity in the Renaissance, have guided the Western project of self-knowledge. Addressing the curious lay reader with an interdisciplinary approach that includes numerous references to the visual arts, <i>Know Thyself</i> will reintroduce readers to the most profound and enduring ways our civilization has framed the issues of self and society, in the process helping us rediscover the very building blocks of our personality.</p><p>INGRID ROSSELLINI was born in Rome and educated there, and later received a BA, master&#39;s, and Ph.D. in Italian Literature from Columbia, writing her dissertation on Petrarch. She has taught literature and Italian film at Columbia, NYU, Harvard, Princeton, and other universities. She is the daughter of the actress Ingrid Bergman and the director Roberto Rossellini; Isabella Rossellini is her sister. She lives in New York City with her husband and two children.<b>Preface</b><br>Who are you?<br><br>If someone asked that question today, most people would offer answers that, aside from general references to gender, nationality, and ethnicity, would essentially focus on their personal characteristics, choices, and preferences. The common assumption is that the individual self is a fully autonomous and original entity, capable of selecting whatever path he or she decides to entertain in a way that is completely independent from traditional views and expectations. Individual identity, as we conceptualize it today, is something like a kit whose parts can be chosen, styled, and assembled at will: a do-it-yourself enterprise.<br><br>Although that is for the most part true, psychologists never fail to remind us that what we experienced as children remains an essential factor in the shaping of our adult selves. In order to understand our present, we need to revisit our past. The same thing could be said about our collective history: understanding who we were remains an essential component in understanding who we are today.<br><br>Do I mean to imply that <i>Know Thyself</i> is a sort of psychological guide to a more rewarding and fulfilling relation with our true selves? Yes, in fact, but definitely not in a <i>conventional </i>way. What I mean is that this is not a book about psychology but a book about history <i>with a psychological slant</i>: in other words, a book that, besides describing crucial moments of history from Greek antiquity to the Renaissance, highlights how the different definitions that the &#x201c;self&#x201d; has received contributed to the creation of the values and ideals that, down the centuries, have shaped and motivated the choices and actions of people and the makeup of their society.<br><br>In choosing this particular lens for observation, I was inspired by the nineteenth-century French historian Fustel de Coulanges, who claimed that recollecting facts is an insufficient way to look at history without an equal focus on the nature and development of the human personality. What that perspective reveals is that history is a complex tapestry woven from actual events but also from the narratives that we humans have imposed upon those facts to try to make sense of ourselves and our reality.<br><br>This book is meant to be not an academic treatise but a guide addressed to the lay reader who, while genuinely curious to explore the past, often feels intimidated by the excessive complexity of scholarly studies. Things have only gotten worse in these last decades: because as the disciplines we generally label humanities have become increasingly neglected in our academic curricula, understanding earlier ways of thinking has become, for many, ever more difficult and frustrating.<br><br>To try to remedy that confusion and make this book as clear and accessible as possible, I chose to avoid the over-detailed style typical of specialized approaches, to offer instead an interdisciplinary overview that, although simplified, still provides a comprehensive map of major patterns of history and culture. To clarify the discussion, I have also included many references to the visual arts. This choice is based on the fact that for thousands of years&#x2014;at least until the invention of the printing press, in the middle of the fifteenth century&#x2014;visual art was the only available means of mass communication capable of conveying, to a population that was largely illiterate, the models of excellence that the political, philosophical, and/or religious ideology of the times considered best fitted to exemplify what a human being was expected to be.<br><br>An important theme that we will explore while looking at the ideals that different epochs nurtured concerns the recurrent creation of legendary and mythical facts&#x2014;the narratives that, for the sake of inspiration, tradition fostered with an intensity that often appears much too exuberant for the rigorous test of credibility as Joseph Campbell indicated when he wrote that a &#x201c;myth is something that has never happened, and is happening all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>To begin, let me bring you back to Delphi of ancient Greece, where people went to consult the oracle of Apollo: the Greek god of reason who was also the only pagan divinity who appeared willing to respond to the people who came to seek his advice.<br><br>I use the verb &#x201c;to appear&#x201d; because how Apollo&#x2019;s oracle worked was more ambiguous than revelatory, in the sense that rather than offering clear guidance, it only provided cryptic hints and scattered pieces of information. These were as confusing and indirect as the language of his messenger&#x2014;the priestess, called Pythia, who in delirious fits of trance channeled the voice of Apollo, by whom she claimed to be possessed. The paradox of the oracle was that because it forced people to interpret the vagueness of those utterances, the ball was implicitly returned right back to those who sought its guidance. That way, rather than having the god clearly telling them what to do, people were indirectly led to use their own intellectual faculties to come up with the answers best fitted for their particular challenges and problems.<br><br>The key to that clever strategy was expressed in the motto etched at the top of Apollo&#x2019;s temple: &#x201c;Know thyself.&#x201d; The dictum essentially meant this: because the meaning you give to your life is what propels your actions, before asking <i>what to do</i>, ask yourself <i>who you are</i>.<br><br>This was (and is) by no means an easy endeavor, as proven by the endlessly varied answers that we humans have come up with all along the centuries.<br><br>Take our modern view of identity, for example. To encourage self-awareness in a child, we say, discover the talents and qualities that make <i>you </i>the very special and original person that you are. The corollary idea is that only by developing one&#x2019;s distinct and unique identity can one become a good member of the &#x201c;larger self&#x201d; that society represents.<br><br>If confronted with such an example of fierce individualism, the Greeks of early times would have recoiled in horror. To the Greeks, attributing ultimate value to choices and preferences that focused on the singular over the collective <i>self </i>would have been considered an absolutely unethical, if not completely unthinkable, proposition. For the Greeks, one&#x2019;s place of origin represented not simply a geographic setting but rather the place of one&#x2019;s family and community and as such the overriding source of one&#x2019;s identity. Where you were born and the social group to which you belonged determined who you were and consequently what was expected from you. Individual freedom of choice, the way we understand the term today, had little to do with that older mentality. For that reason, the command to &#x201c;know thyself&#x201d; essentially meant that you should use the guidance of reason to fulfill, in the best way possible, the ethical duties and obligations that your role as a member of the larger community entails.<br><br>This dramatic difference of interpretation may lead us to think that between that past and our present no direct connection can be drawn. As this book will show, however, that&#x2019;s not at all true. Even if our balance has dramatically shifted toward the singular self, finding a point of convergence between the individual and the collective still remains a very pressing concern of our contemporary existence. What that tells us is that despite the ever-evolving patterns of history, the concept of identity has always involved two fundamental dimensions: who we are independently, and who we are in relation to one another.<br><br>The latter aspect has prompted endless debate throughout our cultural history. Are we naturally predisposed to live with others, as Aristotle believed, when he famously stated that man is a &#x201c;political animal&#x201d;? Or is society a useful but totally unnatural artifice only created and maintained to increase our chance of survival? Although no definite conclusion has been reached (or is ever likely to be), we can all agree that even if we consider our socially inclined character instinctual, that instinct has nothing to do with the inflexible, unvarying spirit of communal collaboration that rules the life of an ant or a bee. In fact, our all-too-human tendency to favor self-interest well above communal purposes has always been the most consistent obstacle to the creation of a fully harmonic and unified society.<br><br>Of course, in the small and culturally cohesive communities of early historical times, keeping the individual in line with the greater identity that society represented was far easier than in the free, diversified, and fast-changing reality of our globalized and technologically connected world. Given such complexity, fostering a civic-minded identity has become more difficult than ever, as we see in the polarization of opinions and ideas that characterize our contemporary world.<br><br>What to do about this? This book does not pretend to offer an answer to such a difficult problem. All it proposes is to return to the early times of our history with the intention of rediscovering the building blocks of our contemporary personality. My belief is that only by exploring the ways in which past generations have looked at our inner landscape and the narratives they developed to cope with the contradictions of our nature can we acquire a better understanding of how we got here and what made us who we are today. Even if that alone would not solve our contemporary problems, improving our critical capacity to look within can contribute to increasing, even by just a few degrees, the clarity our present needs in order to find the best way to progress toward the future in a fruitful and positive manner.<br><br><i>Know Thyself</i> is divided into five parts: ancient Greece, ancient Rome, early Middle Ages, late Middle Ages, and humanism and the Renaissance.<br><br>The first part of the book explores the Greek belief that man was a creature occupying a point in between an animal and a god. Reason, which was considered the principal quality of human life, was meant to maintain that central balance through the control of all passions, including the excessive expressions of pride and ambition that the Greeks defined as hubris. From Homer&#x2019;s epics to the development of the polis, the birth of philosophy, and the creation of democracy, the immense faith that the Greeks placed in their understanding of human reason produced one of the most vibrant civilizations the world had ever seen. Yet, despite all their brilliance, the Greeks also imbued culture with some of the sturdiest seeds of bias and prejudice&#x2014;as in disparaging all non-Greeks as uncivilized barbarians (when in fact Greece owed an enormous debt to much older Eastern cultures, like the Egyptian and the Babylonian) and attributing a gender quality to the concept of rationality. This was a quality that only men were believed to possess to the total exclusion of women, who, as symbols of sensuality, were seen as the embodiment of the irrational passions and appetites belonging to the material body. Assuming that the mind of a woman was too weak to harness the impulses of the body had long-lasting consequences in Western culture. Barring women from all social and political activities was the most damaging effect of that prejudice. Significantly, the word &#x201c;virtue&#x201d; derives from <i>vir</i>, which means &#x201c;man&#x201d; in Latin, while the word &#x201c;hysteria,&#x201d; which was used up to the nineteenth century to indicate emotional instability, derives from <i>hystera</i>, meaning &#x201c;uterus&#x201d; in Greek.<br><br>One of the most influential views that the Greek philosophical tradition established was to identify in <i>reason </i>the governing force of the entire universe: as the mind ruled the body, the cosmos was believed to have received its harmony and order (<i>kosmos </i>in Greek meant &#x201c;order&#x201d;) from a divine and superior rational Mind. To live in agreement with that divine force, man had to apply to himself and to his society the same rules of harmonic collaboration that regulated all other aspects of nature. This view led the Greeks to passionately despise all tyrants and despots: people who, allowing pride to override judgment and rationality, arrogantly assumed that their talent alone was sufficient to rule society. Ironically, the end of the polis era was brought about by what the classical times had feared most: the rise of the monarchic absolutism of the Macedonian king Alexander the Great.<br><br>The second part of the book describes the enormous influence that the Greek concept of polis (which is the root of the word &#x201c;politics&#x201d;) had on its Roman conquerors&#x2014;most important, the view that man, as a rational being, could realize his full humanness only through the military, civic, and political participation that the city demanded. For the Greeks, as well as the Romans, civilization (from <i>civitas</i>, &#x201c;city&#x201d; in Latin) could be attained only by men who, by fully assuming their role of citizens, brought to full fruition their inner talents and potentialities.<br><br>Of all of Roman history, the period that most political thinkers, from Cicero to the American Founding Fathers, considered the best example of an ideal society was the time of the Roman republic, which came to an end with the ascent to power of Augustus and the creation of the Roman empire. To give the impression that his rule did not contradict but rather fulfilled the earlier ethos of Roman times, Augustus tried to instill in his subjects the belief that in following his leadership, Rome would have fulfilled its destiny as ruler of the world&#x2014;a role assigned to the city by the gods in recognition of its extraordinary contributions to law, culture, and civilization. Despite the considerable boost that the narrative received from Roman writers and artists, that positive image did not withstand the test of time, especially when the corruption of so many emperors who followed Augustus caused the unraveling of the moral fabric that had once sustained the greatness of Rome.<br><br>The third part of the book analyzes the rise of Christianity (an offshoot of Judaism, which was also greatly influenced by the Hellenistic tradition and the mysticism of Eastern cults) amid the havoc brought about by the barbarian invasions and the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The Greeks and the Romans had optimistically believed, with Aristotle, that men, being rational, were naturally inclined to coexist with others to create a just and balanced society. Christianity sharply refuted that view, affirming that humanity, having suffered irreparable damage after the original sin of Adam and Eve, could not have functioned without the assistance of faith and the intermediary action of grace. The fall of Rome was used as evidence that given the sinful defectiveness of man, no attempt to create a perfect society would have succeeded because human egotism would have always prevailed over communality and hate over empathy and justice. Within that new, pessimistic mind-set, the world was transformed into a place of sorrow and hardship: a locus of trial for a sinful humanity whom God would judge at the end of time. As religion became entrenched with every aspect of the human existence, the church, filling the void left behind by the secular state, assumed a role of leadership and preeminence that, next to spiritual, was also cultural, political, administrative, and institutional.<br><br>The fourth part of the book shows how the pessimism that pervaded the early part of the Middle Ages started to lift in the eleventh century, when, with the end of the barbarian invasion, a period of peace and prosperity slowly began. The main characteristic of those times was the rebirth of cities and the rise of a new merchant class eager to establish its place in society independent of the aristocratically led hierarchy of the previous feudal era.<br><br>The grea...</p><h2>Batman: The Jiro Kuwata Batmanga Vol. 3: The Classic Manga Available in English in Its Entirety for the First Time!</h2><p>In the 1960s, during the height of Bat-mania, mangaka (comic book creator) Jiro Kuwata was commissioned to write and draw a series of original Batman comics for the Japanese market.

Westlake turns the world of crime and criminals upside down. The bad get better, the good slide a bit, and Lord help anyone caught between a thief named John Dortmunder and the current object of his intentions. Now Westlake's seasoned but often scoreless crook must take on an impossible crime, one he doesn't want and doesn't believe in. But a little blackmail goes a long way in... WHAT'S SO FUNNY?<br>All it takes is a few underhanded moves by a tough ex-cop named Eppick to pull Dortmunder into a game he never wanted to play. With no choice, he musters his always-game gang and they set out on a perilous treasure hunt for a long-lost gold and jewel-studded chess set once intended as a birthday gift for the last Romanov czar, which unfortunately reached Russia after that party was over.<br>From the moment Dortmunder reaches for his first pawn, he faces insurmountable odds. The purloined past of this precious set is destined to confound any strategy he finds on the board. Success is not inevitable with John Dortmunder leading the attack, but he's nothing if not persistent, and some gambit or other might just stumble into a winning move.<br><br></p><p>DONALD E. WESTLAKE has written numerous novels over the past thirty-five years under his own name and pseudonyms, including Richard Stark. Many of his books have been made into movies, including THE HUNTER, which became the brilliant film noir POINT BLANK, and the 1999 smash hit PAYBACK. He penned the Hollywood scripts for THE STEPFATHER and THE GRIFTERS, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay. The winner of three Edgar awards and a Mystery Writers of America Grand Master, Donald E. Westlake was presented with The Eye, the Private Eye Writers of America&#39;s Lifetime Achievement Award, at the Shamus Awards. He lives with his wife, Abby Adams, in rural New York State.*Starred Review* Perennially star-crossed thief John Dortmunder is blackmailed by Johnny Eppick, a retired New York City cop. After careful study, Eppick has concluded that Dortmunder is the finest thief not already in jail. So, unless Dortmunder steals an 800-pound gold-and-jewel-encrusted chess set intended for Russia's last czar, he's off to prison again. But the job, in Dortmunder's very professional opinion, is impossible. The chess set is in the basement vault of a Manhattan bank building, and it's been there--safe--for 60 years. Between a rock and a hard place, Dortmunder is even more hangdog and dour than usual, and that translates to especially fertile ground for the fourteenth caper-gone-wrong novel in this delightful series. Fans of the fatalistic crook will be happy to see Dortmunder's quirky crew back again and will revel in their pre-Copernican view of a Manhattan-based solar system. Readers new to the Dortmunder series will simply laugh, then head to the library for more. Westlake is a national literary treasure, and his latest effort only enhances his value. Neocon pundit William Kristol recently wrote that Westlake deserves the Nobel Prize for Literature. The neocons haven't been right about much lately, but Kristol just may be on to something this time. <i>Thomas Gaughan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

When the ensuing silence stretched more than a few moments, the solicitor readjusted his neck cloth, cleared his throat, and shifted his inkwell one inch closer to the edge of the blotter centered on his gargantuan desk.</p> <p>Two of his minions watched the client-whom they no doubt expected to rant and throw things in the grand family tradition-from a careful distance.</p> <p>Lucas Denning, newly minted Marquis of Deene, took out the gold watch Marie had given him when he'd come down from university. The thing had stopped for lack of timely winding, but Deene made it a point to stare at his timepiece before speaking.</p> <p>"Impossible, Hooker? I'm curious as to the motivation for such hyperbole from a man of the law."</p> <p>One clerk glanced nervously at the other when Hooker stopped fussing with his files.</p> <p>"My lord, you cannot mean to deprive a man of the company of his legitimate offspring." Hooker's pudgy, lily-white hands continued to fiddle with the accoutrements of his trade. "We're discussing a girl child, true, but one in her father's possession in even the simplest sense. The courts do not exist to satisfy anybody's whims, and you can't expect them to pluck that child from her father's care and place her in... in yours. You have no children of your own, my lord, no wife, no experience raising children, and you've yet to see to your own succession. Even were the man demented, the courts would likely consider other possibilities before placing the girl in your care."</p> <p>Deene snapped the watch shut. "I heard her mother's dying wishes. That should count for something. Wellington wrote me up in the dispatches often enough."</p> <p>One of the other men came forward, a prissier, desiccated version of Hooker, with fewer chins and less hair.</p> <p>"My lord, do you proceed on dying declarations alone, that will land you in Chancery, where you'll be lucky to have the case heard before the girl reaches her majority. And endorsements of a man's wartime abilities by the Iron Duke are all well and good, but consider that raising children, most especially young girl children, should not have much in common with battling the Corsican."</p> <p>An insult lurked in that soft reply, but truth as well. Every street sweeper in London knew the futility of resorting to the Court of Chancery. The clerk had not exaggerated about the delays and idiosyncrasies of that institution.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, my lord." Hooker rose, while Deene remained seated. "We look forward to serving the marquessate in all of its legal undertakings, but in this, I'm afraid, we cannot honestly advise you to proceed."</p> <p>Deene got to his feet, taking small satisfaction from being able to look down his nose, quite literally, at the useless ciphers whose families he kept housed and fed. "Draw up the pleadings anyway."</p> <p>He stalked out of the room, the urge to destroy something, to pitch Hooker's idiot files into the fire, to snatch up the fireplace poker and lay about with it, nigh overcoming his self-discipline.</p> <p>"My lord?"</p> <p>The third man had the temerity to follow Deene from the room, which was going to serve as a wonderful excuse for Deene's long-denied display of frustration-a marquis did not have tantrums-when Deene realized the man was carrying a pair of well-made leather gloves.</p> <p>"My thanks." Deene snatched the gloves from the man's hand, but to his consternation, the fellow held onto the gloves for a bit, making for a short tug-of-war.</p> <p>"If your lordship has one more moment?"</p> <p>The clerk let the gloves go. The exchange had been bizarre enough to penetrate Deene's ire, mostly because, between Hooker &amp; Sons and the Marquis of Deene, obsequies were the order of the day and had been for generations.</p> <p>"Speak." Deene pulled on a glove. "You're obviously ready to burst with some crumb of legal wisdom your confreres were not inclined to share."</p> <p>"Not legal wisdom, my lord." The man glanced over his shoulder at the closed door behind them. "Simple common sense. You'll not be able to wrest the girl from her father through litigious means, but there are other ways."</p> <p>Yes, there were. Most of them illegal, dangerous, and unethical-but tempting.</p> <p>Deene yanked on the second glove. "If I provoke him to a duel, Dolan stands an even chance of putting out my lights, sir, a consummation my cousin and sole heir claims would serve him very ill. I doubt I'd enjoy it myself."</p> <p>This fellow was considerably younger than the other two, with an underfed, scholarly air about him and a pair of wire-rimmed glasses gracing his nose. The man drew himself up as if preparing for oral argument.</p> <p>"I do not advocate murder, my lord, but every man, every person, has considerations motivating them. The girl's father is noted to be mindful of his social standing and his wealth."</p> <p>Vulgarly so. "Your point?"</p> <p>"If you offer him something he wants more than he wants to torment you over the girl, he might part with her. The problem isn't legal. The solution might not be legal either."</p> <p>If there was sense in what the young man was saying, Deene was too angry to parse it out.</p> <p>"My thanks. I will consider the not legal alternatives, as you suggest. Good day."</p> <p>"My lord, that wasn't what I meant-"</p> <p>Deene was down the stairs and out the door before the idiot could finish his sentence. Fortunately for all in Deene's path, his coachman was just bringing the horses around the corner at a sedate walk. Deene climbed in before the vehicle even stopped moving.</p> <p>Anthony Denning folded down his edition of the Times, his expression impassive. "Any luck with your pet weasels?"</p> <p>Deene appropriated the spot beside him, since Anthony was on the forward-facing seat. "They were waiting for me to lay waste to the office from the moment I arrived."</p> <p>"Uncle once said that was the best way to get their attention."</p> <p>Deene stared out the window, knowing Anthony was simply trying to make conversation. "His tempers were just another way for him to feel powerful while incurring ridiculous costs and earning a reputation as a dangerous lunatic."</p> <p>Anthony set the paper aside as Deene banged twice on the roof quite stoutly. The horses moved up to the trot only to come back to the walk two blocks later.</p> <p>"I should have ridden."</p> <p>"You should have let me accompany you," Anthony said. He had the knack of sounding not like he was scolding, which he was, but like he was saddened to have been denied an opportunity to serve.</p> <p>"You'll make a lousy marquis when Dolan douses my lights, Anthony. I appreciate the support, but my problems with Dolan are personal."</p> <p>Anthony bore the same Denning family features as his cousin: blue eyes, wavy blond hair, a lanky build, and decent features. He'd look like a Marquis of Deene, but he'd never be able to carry out the displays of temper, incontinent drinking, and excesses of sexual indulgence Polite Society expected of the titleholder.</p> <p>Anthony did, however, make a fine supervisor to the myriad Deene land stewards, for which Deene was shamelessly grateful.</p> <p>"I'll take Beast out this afternoon prior to the fashionable hour. Perhaps some carousing tonight will improve my humor as well."</p> <p>Anthony picked up his newspaper, a bland smile on his face. "A man newly out of mourning cannot neglect his carousing. Once the Season starts, you'll be waltzing the night away. Then there's every house party and shooting party in the land to attend while each ambitious mama in the realm tries to put you on a leash for her darling daughter."</p> <p>"If you're trying to cheer me up, Cousin, you are failing spectacularly."</p> <p>Though the solicitors had mentioned that a man with a wife might stand a better chance in the courts than one without.</p> <p>What a dolorous, uncomfortable thought.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Lady Eve Windham's great fall had happened on her sixteenth birthday. In the eyes of Polite Society, it was a bad fall from a fast horse.</p> <p>Eve's family knew it to be a fall from grace, while Eve understood it to be a fall of even more disastrous dimensions than that. A long, hard fall, involving injury to her heart-not just her left wrist and hip-and requiring years of convalescence. Seven years later-she found something ominously biblical about the length of time-she still hadn't gotten back on a horse.</p> <p>Nor entirely mended her heart.</p> <p>Neither situation merited much notice though, because she'd been born the youngest daughter of Their Graces, the Duke and Duchess of Moreland. The Windham family's consequence was such that the exact nature of this youthful indiscretion was never allowed to reach the ears of the gossips, sparing Eve that most inconvenient and troublesome Windham family tradition-Great Scandal.</p> <p>Great Scandal might as well have the status of a great-aunt, so frequently did it come to call upon the Windhams. His Grace's offspring included two by-blows, both fortunately conceived prior to his acquisition of the title, and also-God be thanked-before his acquisition of a duchess.</p> <p>When Windhams married, the firstborn was typically not a nine-months babe. In fact, nobody could recall when a Windham firstborn had been a nine-months babe, not even back to the present duke's late grandfather. And yet, Windham infants were notoriously healthy from birth.</p> <p>The Windham sisters had by a narrow margin evaded what amounted to the family curse. With Maggie and Sophie wed, that margin was so narrow as to suggest Windham brides conceived on their very wedding nights. The third Windham sister to marry, Louisa, Countess of Kesmore, was being closely watched to see if she too was going to present her earl with an heir in such spanking time.</p> <p>Eve Windham, by contrast, had no intention of allowing herself to encounter those circumstances conducive to the subsequent appearance of a baby.</p> <p>Not now, not ever.</p> <p>And therein lay a problem of disastrous-even scandalous-proportions, for no less a person than Esther, Her Grace, the Duchess of Moreland, had lately taken a notion to see her two remaining unwed daughters escorted up the aisle.</p> <p>Locked in wed, as Eve's brothers used to say.</p> <p>All three brothers were married now, and saying very different things indeed.</p> <p>"Smile, Evie. Trottenham is on his way over."</p> <p>Eve pasted the requisite smile on her face and glanced around the ballroom. "Be still my tender heart." The tone of her words was at variance with their content, which caused Eve's sister Genevieve to smile as well.</p> <p>"He's not so bad, or you wouldn't have given him a minuet."</p> <p>Eve said nothing as her latest admiring swain wove ever closer through the crowd. Jenny was right: he wasn't so bad, or so good. He'd serve as one of this Season's decoys if need be.</p> <p>Eve kept her smile in place, though the thought of another entire Season-months!-of social prevarication made her oppressively tired.</p> <p>"My lady." Trottenham bowed over her hand, bringing his heels together like some stuffy Prussian officer.</p> <p>"Mr. Trottenham, a pleasure." Though it wasn't.</p> <p>"I believe the sets are forming for my dance." He wiggled his blond eyebrows, probably his attempt at flirtation. Jenny took a whiff of her wrist corsage, though Eve thought her sister might be hiding a smirk.</p> <p>Eve placed her gloved fingers over his hand, and for the thousandth time, prepared to tread that fine line between reeling a man in and casting him away. In the course of the dance, she batted her eyes, though twice she forgot the name of Mr. Trottenham's estate. She let him hold her a trifle too close-as she tittered. The grating titter was a rarefied art form.</p> <p>"Lady Eve, has my conversation grown tiresome?" Trottenham twirled her gently under his arm while he spoke, and the slight resulting vertigo was Eve's first clue she was in trouble.</p> <p>"Nonsense, Mr. Trottenham. I'm merely concentrating a bit on the steps of the dance." She treated him to her most fatuous simper, while sounds around her altered as if from far away, including the sound of Eve's own voice. Each sound became both clearer-more detached from other noises-and less real.</p> <p>"One can't expect such a pretty little lady to dance and follow a conversation." Trottenham beamed an indulgent smile at her. "Though my sisters tell me..."</p> <p>He prattled on, while Eve dealt with the peculiar sense that her head was three feet wide and that she could feel sensations with her hair. By the time the dance concluded, the visual distortions had begun.</p> <p>"Jenny, I must leave." Eve kept her voice down. The next afflictions would be nausea and much-worse vertigo, and there was no way on earth Eve could afford talk to circulate that she had been unwell or dizzy at a social function.</p> <p>Jenny's perpetual smile dimmed. "Is it a megrim, dearest?"</p> <p>"A bad one." Though there was no such thing as a good megrim. "There must have been red wine in the punch."</p> <p>"Mama's playing cards with Aunt Gladys. I can fetch her and have the coach brought around."</p> <p>"There's not time." Before Eve's eyes, odd lights began to pulse around Jenny's head.</p> <p>"Deene is here. He can see you home."</p> <p>Eve made no protest, which was surely a measure of abject misery. "Fetch him."</p> <p>Jenny moved off while Eve sidled closer to the French doors letting in fresh air from the terrace. The Season was still a few weeks off, so the night was brisk. The darkness beckoned, as did the quiet.</p> <p>Quiet and darkness were her only friends when a headache struck. Laudanum was a last resort, lest she become dependent on it.</p> <p>"Lady Eve." Deene stood before her, tall and strikingly handsome in his evening finery. He bowed over her hand, doing a credible impersonation of a proper gentleman. "You don't look well."</p> <p>How perceptive. At least he'd spoken quietly.</p> <p>She managed to bat her eyes at him. "Get me out of here without causing talk. Please."</p> <p>His gaze traveled over her quickly, assessingly. Eve would have hated that, except it was a completely impersonal inventory. "A breath of fresh air is in order."</p> <p>"Deene, nobody is going to believe-"</p> <p>He tucked her hand over his arm, beamed a brilliant smile at her, and led her out to the terrace. As soon as they'd gained the edge of the illumination cast by the torches, he paused and took off his jacket. "Unless you start squawking, nobody remarked our departure."</p> <p>He settled his jacket over Eve's shoulders and gave the lapels a little tug to bring it close around her. Eve's first impression was of blessed warmth.</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>"My pleasure." He didn't exactly sneer the words, but neither were they sincere. No matter. If he could get Eve home without further embarrassment, she'd suspend their skirmishing for one evening and be grateful.</p> <p>He offered his arm again. "There's a gate this way we can use."</p> <p>Eve hadn't meant to hesitate, but it was difficult even to think when that ominous ache started up at the base of her skull.</p> <p>"For God's sake, Eve Windham, it was just a kiss under the mistletoe, probably inspired by...</p></p><h2>Seriously Funny: Poems about Love, Death, Religion, Art, Politics, Sex, and Everything Else</h2><p><p>Can serious poetry be funny? Chaucer and Shakespeare would say yes, and so do the authors of these 187 poems that address timeless concerns but that also include comic elements.</p><p>Beginning with the Beats and the New York School and continuing with both marquee-name poets and newcomers, <i>Seriously Funny</i> ranges from poems that are capsized by their own tomfoolery to those that glow with quiet wit to ones in which a laugh erupts in the midst of terrible darkness.</p><p>Most of the selections were made in the editors&#x2019; battered compact car, otherwise known as the Seriously Funny Mobile Unit. During the two years in which Barbara Hamby and David Kirby made their choices, they&#x2019;d set out with a couple of boxes of books in the back seat, and whoever wasn&#x2019;t driving read to the other. When they found that a poem made both of them think but laugh as well, they earmarked it.</p><p>Readers will find a true generosity in these poems, an eagerness to share ideas and emotions and also to entertain.

Anything that became trapped in this sticky resin was fossilized and perfectly preserved. The insects and other inclusions found in amber today are providing scientists with unique insights into the history of life on Earth. In this new edition of &#34;Amber&#34;, Andrew Ross provides an engaging overview of this prehistoric substance and its fossilized inclusions. The book explains how amber is formed, where it is found and how to distinguish genuine amber from fakes. It describes its many uses, both in art and science, and recounts the elusive search for DNA from fossilized insects. Detailed keys and stunning photographs, including previously unseen pieces of Burmese amber from the Museum&#39;s collections, guide the reader in the identification of species of insects and other amber inclusions. &#34;Amber&#34; is essential reading for all those with an interest in this natural time capsule.</p><p>Ross&#39;s book fills a niche left vacant by other recent books on the subject. Where other authors have concentrated on the history of amber&#39;s use for decorative objects and adornment, Ross offers more practical value for amateur naturalists. How do you tell fakes? How do you identify inclusions? This book should appeal to hobbyists, museum-goers, and anyone with a serious interest in amber.-David A.

But as Carol Reardon notes, the Civil War saw many other daring assaults and stout defenses. Why, then, is it Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg--and not, for example, Richardson's Charge at Antietam or Humphreys's Assault at Fredericksburg--that looms so large in the popular imagination? <br><br>As this innovative study reveals, by examining the events of 3 July 1863 through the selective and evocative lens of 'memory' we can learn much about why Pickett's Charge endures so strongly in the American imagination. Over the years, soldiers, journalists, veterans, politicians, orators, artists, poets, and educators, Northerners and Southerners alike, shaped, revised, and even sacrificed the 'history' of the charge to create 'memories' that met ever-shifting needs and deeply felt values. Reardon shows that the story told today of Pickett's Charge is really an amalgam of history and memory. The evolution of that mix, she concludes, tells us much about how we come to understand our nation's past.<br><br><br><br></p><p>Pickett&#39;s Charge--the Confederates&#39; desperate (and failed) attempt to break the Union lines on the third and final day of the Battle of Gettysburg--is best remembered as the turning point of the U.S. Civil War. But Penn State historian Carol Reardon reveals how hard it is to remember the past accurately, especially when an event such as this one so quickly slipped into myth. She writes, &#34;From the time the battle smoke cleared, Pickett&#39;s Charge took on this chameleonlike aspect and, through a variety of carefully constructed nuances, adjusted superbly to satisfy the changing needs of Northerners, Southerners, and, finally, the entire nation.&#34; With care and detail, Reardon&#39;s fascinating book teaches a lesson in the uses and misuses of history."Quite apart from its notable historical interest, Ms. Reardon's work is a splendidly lively study of the manipulation, not necessarily deliberate or malign, of public opinion."-- <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> <br></p><h2>Dragon Tears</h2><p>Forced to kill in the line of duty, police detective Harry Lyon finds his rational world transformed into a place of bizarre surprises and unimaginable dangers</p><p><b>Dean Koontz</b>,&nbsp;the author of many #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, lives in Southern California with his wife, Gerda, their golden retriever, Elsa, and the enduring spirit of their goldens, Trixie and Anna.Koontz&#39;s current best-seller relates the story of two Southern California police detectives who track down a demonic serial killer with paranormal abilities.

Rather, their aim is to show how theology can set out from hope and begin to consider its theme in an eschatological light. For this reason they inquire into the ground of the hope of Christian faith and into the responsible exercise of this hope in thought and action in the world today. The various critical discussions should not be understood as rejections and condemnations. They are necessary conversations on a common subject which is so rich that it demands continual new approaches.&#34;</p><p>&#39;With clear decisive strokes, Moltmann shows that for both Jews and Christians history is rooted in actual events and sets its sights on a real future in accordance with God&#39;s promises....

What kind of an all-knowing God asks questions of mere humans? This thought-provoking study of the "questioning" Jesus is a unique exploration of one of his most subversive teaching tools. In Holy Curiosity, popular author and columnist Winn Collier invites readers to hear Jesus's persistent questions, to allow them to penetrate the soul, and to be called to the untamed life that Jesus offers. The questions covered include &#x20ac;� Who condemns you? &#x20ac;� Why do you doubt? &#x20ac;� Do you believe this? &#x20ac;� Does this offend you? &#x20ac;� and more Collier challenges readers to see Jesus in fresh ways, discarding sterile caricatures for a Jesus that is real, strong, and absolutely relentless in his pursuit of us.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing quite like a pointed question to elicit an honest answer. Jesus knew this. He used convicting questions throughout his ministry--not to find out something he didn&#39;t know but to probe into people&#39;s deepest, most unsettled places. In Holy Curiosity, Winn Collier leads us to encounter Jesus in a new way by helping us face Jesus&#39; questions in the Gospels, including: � Why are you afraid? � Are you being willfully stupid? � Do you believe this? � Why do you doubt? We quickly see that we are no different from those Jesus questioned--the grieving and hopeless sister, the fearful friend, the power-crazed hypocrite, or the wallowing invalid. And the questions are just as relevant and life-changing to us today. Collier shows us that Jesus&#39; motivation in asking such provocative questions is true friendship and fierce love. If we allow ourselves to grapple with the issues these questions raise, we will emerge better able to embrace the life-giving power Jesus offers. &#34;Winn Collier has once more produced a very loving, gentle, enticing book of practical but substantial theology. That is a rare feat, and in this case, a very grace-filled one.&#34;--Phyllis Tickle, author of The Great Emergence: How Christianity Is Changing and Why &#34;Winn Collier is one of the few young authors writing today who is as comfortable around Thomas Aquinas as the Simpsons, S�ren Kierkegaard as Anne Lamott, Martin Luther as N. T. Wright. With a curiosity that embraces the great and the grating, Collier takes the reader on a joyous journey of discovery: each of us is part of God&#39;s answer to each of Jesus&#39; questions.&#34;--Leonard Sweet, Drew University, George Fox University, www.sermons.com &#34;I&#39;m a huge Winn Collier fan. In addition to being a great writer and thinker, he&#39;s not afraid to wrestle with the hard issues of life. This is a book you don&#39;t want to miss and a voice you need to hear.&#34;--Margaret Feinberg, author of The Organic God and The Sacred EchoWinn Collier (ThM, Dallas Theological Seminary) is that author of Restless Faith and Let God and is a regular columnist for Relevant magazine. He is leading the formation of a new church community in Charlottesville, Virginia. Collier and his wife have two sons.

Hannah has the honor of serving as head judge of the first annual Hartland Flour Dessert Bake-off, which she anticipates will be good advertising for her already popular bakery, The Cookie Jar. Then one of the judges, high school basketball coach Boyd Watson, is found dead, face down in Hannah's strawberry shortcake, and suspicion falls on Watson's abused wife, Danielle. Determined to prove Danielle's innocence, Hannah ignores the warnings of romantic interest Mike Kingston, the supervisor of detectives at the Winnetka County sheriff's station, not to get involved. Tempting descriptions of meals served at the local establishments, mouth-watering recipes and a warm family of characters ward off the vividly depicted bitter chill of a Minnesota winter.

The street didn&#x2019;t seem much to care; its breeze was close but casual, its smoky scent was touchable. Cars were stubbed out rather than parked, and the power lines drooped from the weight of mute, hot and bothered pigeons.

Visit his website at www.williamkentkrueger.com.<p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p> <p>Henry Meloux, the old Ojibwe Mide, might tell the story this way.</p> <p>He might begin by saying that the earth is alive, that all things on it -- water, air, plants, rocks, even dead trees -- have spirit. In the absence of wind, the grass still trembles. On days when the clouds are dense as gray wool, flowers still understand how to track the sun. Trees, when they bend, whisper to one another. In such a community of spirits, nothing goes unnoticed. Would not the forest, therefore, know that a child is about to die?</p> <p>She is fourteen years, nine months, twenty-seven days old. She has never had a period, never had a boyfriend, never even had a real date. She has never eaten in a restaurant more formal than McDonald's. She has never seen a city larger than Marquette, Michigan.</p> <p>She cannot remember a night when she wasn't awakened by nightmares, some dreamed, many horribly real. She cannot remember a day she was happy, although she has always been hopeful that she might find happiness, discover it like a diamond in the dust at her feet. Through all the horror of her life, she has, miraculously, held to that hope.</p> <p>Until now.</p> <p>Now, though she is only fourteen, she is about to die. And she knows it.</p> <p>Somewhere among the trees below her, the man she calls Scorpio is coming for her.</p> <p>She cringes behind a pile of brush in the middle of a clear-cut hillside studded with stumps like gravestones. The morning sun has just climbed above the tops of the poplar trees that outline the clearing. The chill bite of autumn is in the air. From where she crouches high on the hill, she can see the gleam of Lake Superior miles to the north. The great inland sea beckons, and she imagines sailing away on all that empty blue, alone on a boat taking her toward a place where someone waits for her and worries, a place she has never been.</p> <p>She shivers violently. Before fleeing, she grabbed a thin brown blanket, which she wrapped around her shoulders. Her feet are bare, gone numb in the long, cold night. They bleed, wounded during her flight through the woods, but she no longer feels any pain. They've become stones at the end of her ankles.</p> <p>In the trees far below, a dog barks, cracking the morning calm. The girl focuses on a place two hundred yards distant where, half an hour earlier, she'd emerged from the forest and started to climb the logged-over hillside. An hour after dawn, Scorpio's dog had begun baying. When she heard the hungry sound, she knew he'd got hold of her scent. What little hope she'd held to melted instantly. After that, it was a frantic run trying to stay ahead.</p> <p>Scorpio steps from the shadow of the trees. He's like a whip, thin and cruel and electric in the sunlight. She can see the glint off the blue barrel of the rifle he cradles. Snatch, his black and tan German shepherd, pads before him, nose to the earth, tracking her through the graveyard of stumps. Scorpio scans the hillside above. She thinks she can see him smile, a gash of white.</p> <p>There is no sense in hiding now. In a few minutes, Scorpio will be on her. Grasshopper quick, she pops from the blind of brush and sprints toward the hilltop. Her senseless feet thud against the hard earth. She lets the blanket fall to the ground, leaves it behind her. Starved for sunlight, the skin of her face and arms looks bleached. Beneath her thin, dirty T-shirt her breasts are barely formed, but the small, fleshy mounds rise and fall dramatically as she sucks air in desperate gasps. Behind her, the dog begins a furious barking. He has seen the prey.</p> <p>She crests the hill and comes to a dead end. Before her the ground falls away, a sheer drop two hundred feet to a river that's a rush of white water between jagged rocks. There is no place left to run. She casts a frenzied eye back. Scorpio lopes toward her with Snatch in the lead. To her left and right, there is only the ragged lip of the cut across the hill.</p> <p>Only one way for her to go now: down.</p> <p>The face of the cliff below is a rugged profile offering handholds and small ledges. There are also tufts of brush that cling tenaciously to the stone, rooted in tiny fissures. She spies a shelf ten feet below, barely wider than her foot, but it is enough. She kneels and lowers herself over the edge. Clinging to the brush and the rough knobs of stone that punctuate the cliff, she begins her descent.</p> <p>The rock scrapes her skin, leaves her arms bleeding. Her toes stretch for a foothold but, numbed, feel almost nothing. Weakened by an ordeal that has gone on longer than she can remember, her strength threatens to fail her, but she does not give up. She has never given up. Whatever the horror in front of her, she has always faced it and pushed ahead. This moment is no different. She wills a place to stand. Her feet find support, a few inches of flat rock on which she eases herself down.</p> <p>"Come on, sweet thing. Come on back up."</p> <p>Scorpio's voice is reasonable, almost comforting. She lifts her face. He's smiling, bone-white teeth between thin, bloodless lips. Beside him, the dog snarls and snaps, foam dripping from his purple gums.</p> <p>"Hush!" Scorpio orders. "Sit."</p> <p>Snatch obeys.</p> <p>"Come on, now. Time to end this foolishness."</p> <p>He lays down his rifle, bends low, and offers his hand.</p> <p>In the quiet while she considers, she presses herself to the cliff where the stone still holds the cold of night. She can hear far below the hiss and roiling of the white water.</p> <p>"We'll go back to the cabin," Scorpio says. "Have a little breakfast. Bet you're hungry. Now, doesn't that sound better than running over these woods, ruining those pretty little feet, freezing your ass off?"</p> <p>He bends lower. His outstretched hand pushes nearer, a hand that has offered only humiliation and pain. On his wrist is a tattoo, a large black scorpion, the reason for the name she has given him in her thinking. She eyes his hairy knuckles, then looks into his face, which at the moment appears deceptively human.</p> <p>"Think about it. You find a place to perch on that cliff, then what? It's not so bad out here right now. Sun's up, air's calm. But tonight it'll be close to freezing. That means you, too. You want to freeze to death? Hell, it doesn't matter anyway. I'll just leave old Snatch here to make sure you don't climb back up, go get me some rope, and come down there to get you. But I guarantee if I have to do that, I won't be in a forgiving mood. So what do you say?"</p> <p>Not taking her eyes off him, she seeks a foothold farther down, somewhere out of his reach, but she cannot feel her toes. Finally, she risks a glance below her. In that instant, Scorpio's hand locks around her wrist.</p> <p>"Got you."</p> <p>He's strong, his grip powerful. He drags her kicking up the face of the rock. She struggles, screams as he wraps his arms around her. The dog dances back from the edge, barking crazily. Scorpio's breath smells of tobacco and coffee, but there's another smell coming off him, familiar and revolting. The musk odor of his sex.</p> <p>"Oh, little darling," he croons, "am I going to make you pay."</p> <p>She puts all her desperation, all her remaining strength, into one last effort, a violent twist that breaks her loose, sends her tumbling backward over the cliff.</p> <p>The world spins. First there is blue sky, then white water, then blue sky again. She closes her eyes and spreads her arms. Suddenly she isn't falling but flying. The wind streams across her skin. Her held breath fills her like a smooth balloon. She is weightless.</p> <p>For one glorious moment in her short, unhappy life, she is absolutely free.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Meloux would finish gently, pointing out, perhaps, that the fall of the smallest robin is known to the spirits of the earth, that no death goes unnoticed or unmourned, that the river has simply been waiting, and like a mother she has opened wide her arms.</p> <p>Copyright � 2006 by William Kent Krueger</p></p><h2>Edgar Degas (Getting to Know the World&#39;s Greatest Artists)</h2><p>Examines the life and work of the nineteenth-century artist Edgar Degas, who loved to paint scenes of Paris and the people who worked and lived there.</p><p>Mike Venezia is the author of several nonfiction books for children.&#34;The excellent-quality reproductions do a great deal to enhance and extend the text.&#34;</p><h2>Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland</h2><p>Judy Garland. The girl with the pigtails, the symbol of innocence in The Wizard of Oz. Judy Garland. The brightest star of the Hollywood musical and an entertainer of almost magical power. Judy Garland. The woman of a half-dozen comebacks, a hundred heartbreaks, and countless thousands of headlines. Yet much of what has previously been written about her is either inaccurate or incomplete, and the Garland the world thought it knew was merely a sketch for the astonishing woman Gerald Clarke portrays in <b>Get Happy</b>. Here, more than thirty years after her death, is the real Judy. <br><br>To tell her story, Clarke took ten years, traveled thousands of miles across two continents, conducted hundreds of interviews, and dug through mountains of documents, many of which were unavailable to other biographers. In a Tennessee courthouse, he came across a thick packet of papers, unopened for ninety years, that laid out the previously hidden background of Judy's beloved father, Frank Gumm. In California, he found the unpublished memoir of Judy's makeup woman and closest confidante, a memoir centered almost entirely on Judy herself. <b>Get Happy</b> is, however, more than the story of one woman, remarkable as she was. It is a saga of a time and a place that now seem as far away, and as clouded in myth and mystery, as Camelot-the golden age of Hollywood. Combining a novelist's skill and a movie director's eye, Clarke re-creates that era with cinematic urgency, bringing to vivid life the unforgettable characters who played leading roles in the unending drama of Judy Garland: Louis B. Mayer, the patriarch of the world's greatest fantasy factory, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Arthur Freed, the slovenly producer who revolutionized the movie musical and gave Judy her best and most enduring parts. Sexy Lana Turner, Judy's friend and idol, who had a habit of trying to snatch away any man Judy expressed interest in. <br><br>And what men they were! Oscar Levant, the wit's wit, whose one-liners could all but kill. Artie Shaw, whose sweet and satiny clarinet had a whole nation dancing. Handsome Tyrone Power, who caused millions of hearts to pound every time he looked out from the screen with his understanding eyes. Orson Welles, Hollywood's boy genius and the husband of a movie goddess, Rita Hayworth. Brainy Joe Mankiewicz, who knew everything there was to know about women, but who confessed that he was baffled by Judy. Vincente Minnelli, who showed what wonders Judy could perform in front of a camera and who fathered her first child, Liza-but who also, with an act of shocking betrayal, caused her first suicide attempt. Charming, brawling Sid Luft, who gave her confidence, then took it away. And the smooth and seductive David Begelman, who stole her heart so he could steal her money. <br><br>Toward the end of her life, Garland tried to tell her own story, talking into a tape recorder for hours at a time. With access to those recordings-and to her unfinished manuscript, which offers a revelation on almost every page-Clarke is able to tell Judy's story as she herself might have told it. "It's going to be one hell of a great, everlastingly great book, with humor, tears, fun, emotion and love," Judy promised of the autobiography she did not live to complete. But she might just as well have been describing <b>Get Happy</b>. For here at last-told with humor, tears, fun, emotion and love-is the true, unforgettable story of Judy Garland.</p><p>Like his renowned <i>Capote</i>, Clarke's <i>Get Happy</i> is an addictively readable bio of an addict genius. We learn that it wasn't just the Hollywood moguls who mangled Judy Garland's soul. Yes, MGM's Louis B. Mayer did paw her teenage breasts, exacerbate her insecurity by calling her "my little hunchback," feed her uppers and downers ("bolts and jolts"), and repel the U.S. drug czar's personal attempt to get her into rehab. But the true villain was Judy's diabolical stage mom, Ethel Gumm, who fed her pills at age 9. Judy's heart belonged to her daddy, a kindly theater owner cursed with pederastic yearnings that evidently got the family run out of various towns, once by a man named Doc Savage. Daddy died young, and Judy kept hooking up with older men, including two probably gay husbands, one of whom cheated on her with her daughter Liza's husband. Her first best girlfriend in Hollywood (and probable lover) turned out to be a studio spy. She knew at least one of her agents, nicknamed Loeb and Leopold, robbed her blind, but since betrayal was everybody's way of life, she just laughed it off--and died dead broke. Judy cheated on Liza's dad (and her own great director) Vincente Minnelli, with still-handsome Orson Welles, who was cheating on Rita Hayworth. "People like me don't grow up easily," Judy once said. Most people in this book deserved to go up in flames, but only nice Margaret Hamilton, playing the Wicked Witch of the West, actually did so in a filming accident. She recovered; Judy didn't. It's fascinating to read about Judy's self-immolating life. But for a jolt of joy afterward, I prescribe the CD <i>Judy at Carnegie Hall</i>. Clarke lets you know what the songs cost, and what they mean. <i>--Tim Appelo</i><br><b>Praise for Gerald Clarke's <i>Capote</i></b><br><br>"Mr. Clarke has taken on a subject whose life we are used to reading about in the most sensational and superficial terms and has produced a book of extraordinary substance, a study rich in intelligence and compassion. . . . Heartbreaking though it is, one can't put the book down." <br>--Bruce Bawer, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"<i>Capote</i> the biography is more than worthy of Capote the man. The book transcends gossip, falling short of tragedy only to the extent that Capote himself fell short of greatness."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>--Larry Lee, <i>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i><br><br>"This is literary biography the way it should be written, as rich and densely textured as a novel."<p><br> --James Atlas, <i>Vogue</i><br><br>"The book reads as if it had been written alongside the life, rather than after it, like a car following a train, the driver picking up passengers as they alight, always catching the right people at the right time. . . . [An] enthralling, novel-like biography."<br>--Molly Haskell, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br></p></p><h2>Broken Gun Louis Lamour Collection</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

He lives in South Carolina with his family.<br><br> <b>Ian Holt</b> is a Dracula documentarian, historian, and screenwriter. He lives on Long Island.<b>Prologue</b><p>Letter from Mina Harker to her son, Quincey Harker, Esq.</p><p>(To be opened upon the sudden or unnatural death of Wilhelmina Harker)</p><p>9th March 1912</p><p>Dear Quincey,</p><p>My dear son, all your life you have suspected that there have been secrets between us. I fear that the time has come to reveal the truth to you. To deny it any longer would put both your life and your immortal soul in jeopardy.</p><p>Your dear father and I chose to keep the secrets of our past from you in order to shield you from the darkness that shrouds this world. We had hoped to allow you a childhood free from the fears that have haunted us all our adult lives. As you grew into the promising young man you are today, we chose not to tell you what we knew lest you think us mad. Forgive us. If you are reading this letter now, then the evil we so desperately and perhaps wrongly sought to shield you from has returned. And now you, like your parents before you, are in grave danger.</p><p>In the year 1888, when your father and I were still young, we learned that evil lurks in the shadows of our world, waiting to prey upon the unbelieving and the unprepared.</p><p>As a young solicitor, your father was sent into the wilds of Transylvania. His task was to help Prince Dracula conclude the purchase of a property in Whitby, an ancient monastery known as Carfax Abbey.</p><p>During his stay in Transylvania, your father discovered that his host and client, Prince Dracula, was in truth a creature thought to exist only in folktale and legend, one of those which feed upon the blood of the living in order to attain immortal life. Dracula was what the locals called Nosferatu, the Un-Dead. </p><p>You may more readily recognize the creature by its more common name:vampire.</p><p>Prince Dracula, fearing that your father would expose the truth of what he was, imprisoned him in his castle. Dracula himself then booked passage to England on the sailing vessel the Demeter, spending the many days of his voyage hidden in one of dozens of crates in the hull. He concealed himself in this strange fashion because although a vampire may have the strength of ten men and the ability to take many forms, he will burn to ash if struck by the light of the sun.</p><p>At this time, I was staying in Whitby at the home of my closest and dearest friend, Lucy Westenra. A storm had blown in off the sea, and the treacherous Whitby cliffs were shrouded in a dense mist. Lucy, unable to sleep, saw from her window the storm-driven ship heading for the rocks. Lucy raced into the night in an attempt to raise the alarm before the ship was wrecked, but she was too late. I awoke in a panic, saw that Lucy was not beside me in bed, and raced out into the storm to search for her. I found her at the cliff's edge, unconscious and with two small holes in her neck.</p><p>Lucy became deathly ill. Her fianc�, Arthur Holmwood, the son of Lord Godalming, and his dear friend, a visiting Texan whom you know as your namesake, Quincey P. Morris, raced to her side. Arthur called every doctor in Whitby and beyond, but none could explain Lucy's illness. It was our friend who owned the Whitby Asylum, Dr. Jack Seward, who called in his mentor from Holland, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing.</p><p>Dr. Van Helsing, a learned man of medicine, was also acquainted with the occult. He recognized that Lucy was suffering from the bite of a vampire.</p><p>It was then that I finally received word from your father. He had escaped from Dracula's castle and taken refuge in a monastery where he, too, was deathly ill. I was forced to leave Lucy's bedside and travel to meet him. It was there in Buda-Pesth that we were married.</p><p>Your father told me of the horrors he had seen, and it was from this that we learned the identity of the vampire that had attacked Lucy and now threatened all our lives: Prince Dracula.</p><p>Upon returning from Buda-Pesth, we were told that Lucy had died. But worse was to follow. Days after her death, she had risen from her grave. She was now a vampire and was feeding on the blood of small children. Dr. Van Helsing, Quincey Morris, Dr. Seward, and Arthur Holmwood were faced with a terrible decision. They had no choice but drive a wooden stake through Lucy's heart in order to free her poor soul.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Prince Dracula returned in the night to attack me. After this attack, we all swore an oath to hunt down and destroy the vampire, and rid the world of his evil. And so it was that we became the band of heroes and chased Dracula back to his castle in Transylvania. There, Quincey Morris died in battle although, like the hero he was, he managed to plunge a knife into Dracula's heart. We watched as Prince Dracula burst into flames, crumbling into dust in the light of the setting sun.</p><p>Then, we were free, or so I thought. But about a year after you were born, I began to suffer horrible nightmares. Dracula was haunting me in my dreams. It was then that your father reminded me of the dark prince's warning and how he had claimed, "I shall have my revenge. I shall spread it over centuries. Time is on my side."</p><p>From that day onward, your father and I have had no peace. We have spent our years looking over our shoulders. And now I fear we are no longer strong enough to protect you from his evil and I have made a terrible misjudgment in character.</p><p>Know this, my son, if you are to survive the evil that is now hunting you; embrace the truth I speak in these pages. Look deep within your young self and, as your father and I were once forced to do, find the brave hero within. Dracula is a wise and cunning foe. You cannot run, and there is nowhere to hide. You must stand and fight.</p><p>Good luck, my dear son, and do not be afraid. If Van Helsing is correct, then vampires are truly demons, and God will be at your side as you do battle.</p><p>With all my undying love,</p><p>Your mother, Mina</p><br><b>Chapter I.</b><br><p><b>OCEANS OF LOVE, LUCY.</b></p><p>The inscription was the only thing Dr. Jack Seward could focus on as he felt the darkness overtake him. In the darkness was peace, with no harsh light to illuminate the tattered remains of his life. For years, he had devoted himself to fighting back the darkness. Now he simply embraced it.</p><p>Only at night could Seward find peace with the memory of Lucy. In his dreams, he still felt her warm embrace. For a fleeting moment, he could go back to London, to a happier era, when he found meaning through his place in the world and his research. This was the life he had wished to share with Lucy.</p><p>The early morning din of milk wagons, fishmongers' carts, and other merchant vehicles rattling hurriedly across the cobblestone streets of Paris intruded on Seward's dream and thrust him back into the harsh present. Seward forced his eyes open. They stung worse than fresh iodine on an open wound. As the cracked ceiling of the stale Parisian flophouse room he had been renting came into focus, he reflected on how much his life had changed. It saddened him to see all the muscle tone he had lost. His bicep sagged, resembling one of those hand-sewn muslin tea bags after it had just been removed from a teapot. The veins on his arm were like rivers on a tattered map. He was a shadow of his former self.</p><p>Seward prayed that death would come quickly. He had willed his body to science, to be used in a classroom at his alma mater. He took comfort from the fact that in death he would help to inspire future doctors and scientists.</p><p>After a time, he remembered the watch, still nestled in his left hand. He turned it over. Half past six! For an instant, panic overtook him. Damn it to hell. He had overslept. Seward staggered to his feet. An empty glass syringe rolled off the table and shattered on the grimy wooden floor. A small, smoked brown bottle of morphine was about to follow the fate of the syringe, but he quickly caught the precious liquid, untying the leather belt from his left bicep with a practiced movement. Normal circulation returned as he rolled down his sleeve and returned the silver monogrammed cuff link to his frayed dress shirt. He buttoned up his vest and slipped on his jacket. Wallingham &amp; Sons were the finest tailors in London. If his suit had been made by anyone else, it would have disintegrated ten years ago. Vanity dies hard, Seward thought to himself with a humorless chuckle.</p><p>He had to hurry if he still wanted to make the train. Where was that address? He had put it in a safe place. Now, when he needed it, he could not recall where exactly that was. He overturned the straw-filled mattress, inspected the underside of the wobbly table, and peered under the vegetable crates that served as dining chairs. He sifted through piles of aged newspaper clippings. Their headlines spoke of Seward's current preoccupation: gruesome stories of Jack the Ripper. Autopsy photos of the five known victims. Mutilated women posed, legs open, as if waiting to accept their deranged killer. The Ripper was deemed a butcher of women&#x2014;but a butcher is more merciful to the animals he slaughters. Seward had reread the autopsy notes countless times. Loose pages of his theories and ideas written on scrap paper, torn cardboard, and unfolded matchboxes fluttered around him like windblown leaves.</p><p>The sweat flowing from Seward's brow began to sting his bloodshot eyes. Damn, where had he put it? The Benefactor had taken enormous risks to get him this information. Seward could not bear the thought of disappointing the only person who still believed in him. Everyone else&#x2014;the Harkers, the Holmwoods&#x2014;all thought he had taken leave of his senses. If they could see this room, Seward knew, they would feel justified in that belief. He scanned the crumbling plaster walls, which bore the evidence of his morphine-induced rants, his wild insights handwritten in ink, coal, wine, even his own blood. No madman would be so obvious. He was certain that these writings would one day prove his sanity.</p><p>Amidst it all, there was a page torn from a book, stabbed into the wall with a bone-handled bowie knife whose blade was stained with old blood. The page featured a portrait of an elegant, raven-haired beauty. Beneath the picture, an inscription: Countess Elizabeth Bathory circa 1582.</p><p>Of course, that's where I hid it. He laughed at himself as he pulled the knife out of the wall, seizing the page and turning it over. In his own barely legible handwriting, he found the address of a villa in Marseilles. Seward removed the cross, wooden stake, and garlic wreaths that hung next to Bathory's picture and scooped up a silver knife from the floor. He placed everything into a false bottom in his medical bag and covered it all with standard medical supplies.</p><p>The train left the Gare de Lyon exactly on time. Seeing it pull away just as he was paying for his ticket, Seward sprinted across the flood-stained building to reach the chugging behemoth as it left the seventh bay door. He managed to catch the last Pullman car and hoist himself on before it had a chance to pick up speed. His heart surged with pride as he made the daring leap. He had done this sort of thing in his youth with the Texan Quincey P. Morris and his old friend Arthur Holmwood. Youth was wasted on the young. Seward smiled to himself as he recalled the reckless days of his innocence...and ignorance.</p><p>The doctor took a seat in the elaborate dining car as the train lumbered southward. It wasn't moving quickly enough. He glanced down at his pocket watch; only five minutes had passed. Seward lamented that he could no longer pass the time by writing in his journal, as he was unable to afford the luxury of such a thing. They were not scheduled to reach Marseilles for ten more hours. There, he would finally have the evidence to prove his theories and show those who had shunned him that he was not mad, that he had been right all along.</p><p>These were going to be the longest ten hours of Seward's life.</p><p>"Billets, s'il vous pla�t!"</p><p>Seward stared wide-eyed at the conductor standing over him with a stern look of impatience.</p><p>"Forgive me," Seward said. He handed the conductor his ticket, adjusting his scarf to cover the torn breast pocket.</p><p>"You are British?" the conductor asked with a heavy French accent.</p><p>"Why, yes."</p><p>"A doctor?" The conductor nodded toward the medical bag between Seward's feet.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Seward watched the conductor's gray eyes catalogue the threadbare person in front of him, the ill-fitting suit and well-worn shoes. He was hardly the image of a respectable doctor. "I will see your bag, please."</p><p>He handed over the bag, for it was not as if he had much choice in the matter. The conductor methodically pulled out medical bottles, read the labels, and dropped them back in with a clink. Seward knew what the conductor was looking for and hoped he wouldn't dig too deeply.</p><p>"Morphine," announced the conductor in a voice so loud that other passengers glanced over. He held up the brown bottle.</p><p>"I sometimes have to prescribe it as a sedative."</p><p>"I will see your license, please."</p><p>Seward searched his pockets. Over a month ago, the International Opium Convention had been signed, prohibiting persons from importing, selling, distributing, and exporting morphine without a medical license. It took him so long to find it that by the time Seward finally produced the license, the conductor was about to pull the cord to stop the train. The conductor examined the paper, frowning, then turned his steely eyes to the travel document. The United Kingdom was the first to use photo identification on their passports. Since that picture had been taken, Seward had lost a tremendous amount of weight. His hair was now much grayer, his beard wild and untrimmed. The man in the train bore little resemblance to the man in the photo.</p><p>"Why are you going to Marseilles, doctor?"</p><p>"I am treating a patient there."</p><p>"What ails this patient?"</p><p>"He's suffering from a Narcissistic Personality Disorder."</p><p>"Qu'est-ce que c'est?"</p><p>"It is a psychological instability causing the patient to inflict predatory, autoerotic, antisocial, and parasitic control on those around them. As well as&#x2014;"</p><p>"Merci." The conductor cut Seward off by handing him back his papers and ticket with a deft flick. He turned and addressed only the men at the next table. "Billets, s'il vous pla�t."</p><p>Jack Seward sighed. Replacing his papers in his jacket, he checked the pocket watch again, a nervous habit. It seemed as if the interrogation had lasted hours, but only another five minutes had passed. He rolled down the fringed window shade to shield his eyes from the daylight and reclined into the plush, burgundy upholstered seat.</p><p>Oceans of Love, Lucy.</p><p>He held the beloved watch close to his heart and closed his eyes to dream.</p><p>It was a quarter century ago. Seward held the same watch up to the light the better to read the inscription: "Oceans of love, Lucy."</p><p>She was there. Alive. "You don't like it," she said, and pouted.</p><p>He couldn't break his stare away from her green eyes, soft as a summer meadow. Lucy had an odd idiosyncrasy of watching a speaker's mouth as if trying to taste the next word before it passed by his lips. She had such a lust for life.

The American Civil War has just begun, and London arms dealer Daniel Alberton is becoming a very wealthy man. His quiet dinner party seems remote indeed from the passions rending America. Yet investigator William Monk and his bride, Hester, sense growing tensions and barely concealed violence. For two of the guests are Americans, each vying to buy Alberton&#x2019;s armaments. Soon Monk and Hester&#x2019;s forebodings are fulfilled as one member of the party is brutally murdered and two others disappear&#x2013; along with Alberton&#x2019;s entire inventory of weapons. As Monk and Hester track the man they believe to be the murderer all the way to Washington, D.C., and the bloody battlefield at Manassas, <i>Slaves of Obsession</i> twists and turns like a powder-keg fuse and holds the reader breathless and spellbound. . . .</p><p><i>Slaves of Obsession</i> moves from Victorian England to the United States on the brink of the Civil War, evoking not only the nuances of the English class system but also the fierce passions and partisan loyalties that ignited the bloodiest conflagration in American history. When Daniel Alberton, a well-born arms merchant, asks private enquiry agent William Monk to investigate an extortion attempt, the former policeman is thrust into a conflict between competing Americans, Lyman Breeland and Philo Trace, who have come to London to purchase guns for the Union and Confederacy forces respectively. Bound by honor to complete the sale of a trove of weapons he has promised to Trace, Alberton refuses Breeland's plea to change his mind. Breeland is championed by Merrit, Alberton's 16-year-old daughter, who makes an impassioned argument for the anti-slavery position. Then Alberton is brutally murdered and the arms shipment stolen, and Merrit elopes with Breeland. Monk and his wife Hester are dispatched to America to retrieve the young woman and bring her seducer back to England to face a murder trial. Hester, who was a nurse in the Crimea, comports herself admirably on the battlefield at Manassas while Monk searches for Breeland and arrests him amidst the carnage. But once back in England, Monk's investigative efforts cast doubt on Breeland's guilt and point to a killer closer to home.<p> Hester Monk emerges as a fascinating character in her own right. Her relationship with the enigmatic William, whose fragmented recollections (of who and what he was before the accident that erased most of his memory) still haunt him, is thoughtfully evoked. As usual, Perry handles the secondary characters with brio. Breeland, in particular, becomes in the author's capable hands a man whose obsessive devotion to the Union cause underscores his inability to return Merrit's love. As Hester tells the infatuated young woman, "To see the mass and lose the individual is not nobility. You are confusing emotional cowardice with honour.... To follow your duty when the cost in friendship is high, or even the cost in love, is a greater vision, of course. But to retreat from personal involvement, from gentleness and the giving of yourself, and choose instead the heroics of a general cause, no matter how fine, is cowardice." This sixth entry in the Monk series evokes the era in which it is set with a fine eye for details of dress, manners, d�cor, and culture, while skillfully unfolding the emotional and intellectual depths of both William and Hester, whose well-honed intelligence makes it clear that she, too, deserves a series of her own. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Among <b>Anne Perry</b>&#x2019;s other novels featuring investigator William Monk are<i> Funeral in Blue</i>, <i>The Twisted Root</i>, <i>A Breach of Promise</i>,<i> The Silent Cry</i>, and <i>Weighed in the Balance</i>.

Determined to clone the rare ghost orchid, Polyrrhiza lindenii, John Laroche leads Orlean on an unforgettable tour of America's strange flower-selling subculture, along with the Seminole Indians who help him and the forces of justice who fight him. In the end, Orlean-and the reader-will have more respect for underdog determination and a powerful new definition of passion. <br>Praise for The Orchid Thief: <br>"Fascinating . . . tales of theft, hatred, greed, jealousy, madness, and backstabbing . . . an engrossing journey."<br>"-Los Angeles Times" <br>"Irresistible . . . a brilliantly reported account of an illicit scheme to housebreak Florida's wild and endangered ghost orchid . . . Its central figure is John Laroche, the 'oddball ultimate' of a subculture whose members are so enthralled by orchids they 'pursue them like lovers.' "<br>"-Minneapolis Star Tribune" <br>"Artful . . . in Ms. Orlean's skillful handling, her orchid story turns out to be distinctly 'something more.' . . . [Her] portrait of her sometimes sad-making orchid thief allows the reader to discover acres of opportunity where intriguing things can be found."<br>"-The New York Times" <br>"Zestful . . . a swashbuckling piece of reporting that celebrates some virtues that made America great."<br>"-The Wall Street Journal" <br>"Deliciously weird . . . compelling."<br>"-Detroit Free Press"</p><p><i>Orchidelirium</i> is the name the Victorians gave to the flower madness that is for botanical collectors the equivalent of gold fever. Wealthy orchid fanatics of that era sent explorers (heavily armed, more to protect themselves against other orchid seekers than against hostile natives or wild animals) to unmapped territories in search of new varieties of <i>Cattleya</i> and <i>Paphiopedilum</i>. As knowledge of the family Orchidaceae grew to encompass the currently more than 60,000 species and over 100,000 hybrids, orchidelirium might have been expected to go the way of Dutch tulip mania. Yet, as journalist Susan Orlean found out, there still exists a vein of orchid madness strong enough to inspire larceny among collectors.<p> <i>The Orchid Thief</i> centers on south Florida and John Laroche, a quixotic, charismatic schemer once convicted of attempting to take endangered orchids from the Fakahatchee swamp, a state preserve. Laroche, a horticultural consultant who once ran an extensive nursery for the Seminole tribe, dreams of making a fortune for the Seminoles and himself by cloning the rare ghost orchid <i>Polyrrhiza lindenii</i>. Laroche sums up the obsession that drives him and so many others: </p><blockquote>I really have to watch myself, especially around plants. Even now, just being here, I still get that collector feeling. You know what I mean. I'll see something and then suddenly I get that <i>feeling</i>. It's like I can't just have something--I have to have it and learn about it and grow it and sell it and master it and have a million of it.</blockquote> Even Orlean--so leery of orchid fever that she immediately gives away any plant that's pressed upon her by the growers in Laroche's circle--develops a desire to see a ghost orchid blooming and makes several ultimately unsuccessful treks into the Fakahatchee. Filled with Palm Beach socialites, Native Americans, English peers, smugglers, and naturalists as improbably colorful as the tropical blossoms that inspire them, this is a lyrical, funny, addictively entertaining read. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i>"The best writers make you care about something you never noticed before. Susan Orlean is a perfect example...In a dry reporter's style, spiked with wit and charged with infectious enthusiasm, Orlean explains orchid biology and traces the history of orchid hunting, scattering surprises as she goes....An endearingly timid explorer who shudders each time she lowers herself into the teeming ooze of the Fakahatchee, Orlean is also an acute observer of the personalities and rivalries she encounters...Orlean allows accidental discoveries and encounters to dicate the book's peculiar, engrossing course."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Anna Mundow, <i>The New York Daily News</i><br><br>"Orlean's hilariously reported, discursive narrative wanders off into Seminole history, real-estate fraud, stolen flora, and the scary, swampy Fakahatchee Strand. Just when you fear you're lost in the Everglades, she returns to the flower at hand, and unleashes some delirious prose....Orlean shows great restraint and never adopts an orchid--readers may not manage to be so cold-blooded."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Alexandra Lange, <i>New York</i> Magazine<br><br>"Artful...In Ms. Orlean's skillful handling, her orchid story turns out to be distinctly 'something more.' Getting to know Mr. Laroche allows her to explore multiple subjects: orchids, Seminole history, the ecology of the Fakahatchee Strand, the fascination of Florida to con men....All that she writes here fits together because it is grounded in her personal experience...acres of opportunity where intriguing things can be found."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"The collecting mania that Susan Orlean has so painstakingly described is, like the orchid, a small thing of grandeur, a passion with a pedigree...Stylishly written, whimsical yet sophisticated, quirkily detailed and full of empathy for a person you might not have thorugh about empethetically...The Orchid Thief shows her gifts in full bloom."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Ted Conover, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Orlean writes in a keenly observant mode reminiscent of John McPhee and Diane Ackerman....In prose as lush and full of surprises as the Fakahatchee itself, Orlean connects orchid-related excesses of the past with the exploits of the present so dramatically an orchid will never just be an orchid again."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Orlean is a beautiful writer, and her story is compelling even for those whose knowledge of orchids is limited to the long-ago prom corsage. The Orchid Thief is a lesson in the dark, dangerous, sometimes hilarious nature of obsession--any obsession. You sometimes don't want to read on, but find you can't help it."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Anita Manning, <i>USA Today</i><br><br>"If you liked MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, this new nonfiction work by Susan Orlean will hold you utterly spellbound. Like many orchids, it's a beautiful hybrid: part crime story (about orchid poaching in the wild swamps of Florida), part exotic read (about a fanatic society of flower breeders). Led by the title character, a charismatic plant smuggler, you'll journey with Orlean through a strangely fascinating, almost mystical subculture."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--<i>Glamour</i><br><br>"Readers suffering from the impeachment blues can start the new year right with The Orchid Thief, a swashbuckling piece of reporting that celebrates some virtues that made America great. Here are visionary passions and fierce obsessions; heroic settings; outsize characters, entrepreneurs on the edge of the frontier, adventurers seeking the bubble reputation....Ms. Orlean, an intrepid sociologist among the orchid fanatics, is also a poetic observer of the Fakahatchee swamp. There's an offhand brilliance in her accounts of its weird beauty and discomforts. But the most compelling sections of this fascinating book deal with the orchids themselves....Zestful."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Frances Taliaferro, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"The landscapes of John Laroche and the state of Florida elicit some of Susan Orlean's best writing....her ear for self-skewing dialogue, her eye for the incongruous, convincing detail, and her Didion-like deftness in description....Such rapturous evocations are reason enough to read Orlean's book."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Dean Crawford, <i>The Boston Globe</i></p><h2>Money &amp; Power (English and French Edition)</h2><p>Rich or poor, we all face the problem of money. But is money chiefly a personal problem of how we manage our resources or a societal problem of how we organize the economy? Jacques Ellul exposes the folly of a purely societal approach -- whether communism, collectivism, socialism, or capitalism -- and argues for individual responsibility. Money, he says, is not neutral, somthing we can use as we like. Instead it is a powerful agent that sets itself against God&#39;s kingdom.

She knew that she was destined for something more, and in 1979, Lilly applied for her dream job at the Goodyear tire factory. Even though the only women she&#x2019;d seen there were secretaries in the front offices where she&#x2019;d submitted her application, she got the job&#x2014;one of the first women hired at the management level. <br>&nbsp;<br>Though she faced daily discrimination and sexual harassment, Lilly pressed onward, believing that eventually things would change. Until, nineteen years later, Lilly received an anonymous note revealing that she was making thousands less per year than the men in her position.&nbsp; Devastated, she filed a sex discrimination case against Goodyear, which she won&#x2014;and then heartbreakingly lost on appeal. Over the next eight years, her case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, where she lost again: the court ruled that she should have filed suit within 180 days of her first unequal paycheck--despite the fact that she had no way of knowing that she was being paid unfairly all those years. In a dramatic moment, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg read her dissent from the bench, urging Lilly to fight back.<br>&nbsp;<br>And fight Lilly did, becoming the namesake of President Barack Obama's first official piece of legislation.

You might even be related to a few. In truth, the tough guys at Goodyear weren't a far cry from what I'd seen and heard in the fields picking cotton or in the barn helping milk the cows at Aunt Lucille's dairy farm.<br><br>I'll never forget the afternoon when my grandfather, Papa, decided he wanted to kill my dog, Buzz. Papa, who claimed to be part Irish, was so pale that he looked part ghost. I'm honestly not sure there was any good in him, but I can also say that he wasn't all that different from most of the other men around me.<br><br>I was only five the day Papa came after Buzz, but my memory of that afternoon is clear as day. I was playing tea party in the front yard, scooping up dirt with a broken teacup Granny Mac had given me, and Buzz was my honored guest. As I set down a cup in front of Buzz, I heard Papa hollering down the road. I looked back at the house, hoping to see that Mama was still right inside the screen door cooking supper, and that she'd hear the racket in time to come out and protect me and Buzz. She wasn't. As Papa's large figure approached us, my stomach clenched. He was carrying something; it looked like a hoe.<br><br>I'd never had a pet before, unless you count the rooster who used to follow me around. But one day Buzz had appeared out of nowhere. We immediately took to each other. He was a funny little dog, brown and white and black with one dark spot shaped like a pumpkin seed on the top of his forehead. I used to rub that spot like it was a good-luck penny. I figured his breed was part everything, with his big hound-dog eyes, those large feet he slapped in front of him like clown shoes, and that mismatched coloring pieced together like a crazy quilt.<br><br>By the time Papa was close enough for me to make out what he was saying, Buzz had scooted under the house. "Where's that goddam worthless mutt?" he yelled. "He ain't worth killing."<br><br>I couldn't say a word. I couldn't even move. My mouth was as dry as if I'd swallowed the cup of dirt. All I could think about was how Papa would slaughter the pigs in the smokehouse. I always got attached to one of them, so I made a point of being as far away from the smokehouse as possible when killing time came. I wanted no part of wash pots filled with boiling-hot water and the hanging, splitting, and dressing of the meat. But I did show up about the time sausage was frying in the deep black skillet.<br><br>"Goddammit, Lilly. You better mind me and get that dog." Papa's eyes were moist and almost closed, like they had Vaseline smeared on them. He turned around and around in a circle trying to find Buzz, almost falling. He was drunk, really drunk. He lurched toward me, and I jumped up. Buzz must have thought Papa was going to hurt me because he shot out from under the porch, growling and circling us. Papa lunged at him, slicing the hoe through the air. I tried to stay between Papa and Buzz, never even thinking that I might get hit.<br><br>As we continued to dance around each other, the screen door slapped shut at last, and Mama came out screaming at Papa. His face and large nose flushed red above his white collared shirt buttoned to the top under his overalls. But other than that he didn't pay Mama a bit of attention as he, Buzz, and I continued to waltz around each other, the hoe thudding hard whenever it hit the ground.<br><br>"I mean it, Tot," she said, using the name everyone (but me) called him. "Don't make no sense to be scaring Lilly like that. Put it down."<br><br>But he was having none of it. He seemed to get madder and madder, and the hoe seemed closer to Buzz with every swing.<br><br>Suddenly Mama flew down the front steps, a long butcher knife in her hand, the same knife she always sharpened on the pedaling wheel before Papa killed the hogs. But not even the knife seemed to sway him. Papa, three times as big as she was, towered above her.<br><br>"Go on, Lilly. Get in the house," Mama said. I could see the look in her eyes, the fear and hatred that made her seem as wild as a rabid dog. I ran up onto the porch and, thankfully, Buzz followed.<br><br>Papa's eyes flashed anger at me as I stared at him through the screen door, my breath coming in quick gasps.<br><br>"Go on home and leave that dog alone," Mama said. She kept that butcher knife raised and pointed at him the whole time, jabbing it a few times in his direction when his temper flared back up. He dropped the hoe at last, and Mama backed him all the way down the steep driveway to the dirt road. And he left, lumbering and swaying his way back home.<br><br>As I watched this scene, I felt like I was suffocating, as if someone had stuck a sack of cotton over my head. I'd heard Mama tell my father how Papa had beaten her as a child. When she was little and he got to drinking, one of his buddies would rush to the house to warn my grandmother that Papa was headed home. She'd hustle the four boys and my mother out of bed to make a run for the barn, hiding in the hay for the rest of the night. Other times, without warning, Papa barged into their bedrooms, hickory stick in hand, and the beatings began.<br><br>After that day, I still rode on top of Papa's wagon and helped him feed the cows and guinea hens, but I never trusted him again. I remember telling myself I'd better be careful about who I let myself love. It was likely they'd turn on you. I also realized it was a good idea to have a knife nearby whenever possible.<br><br>Not long after, Buzz disappeared. I figured he just wandered off. Thankfully, it never occurred to me then that Papa might have gotten his way after all.<br>Many years later, when I first started working at Goodyear, the union guys liked to tell the women that they were going to "pick" us. That is, they were going to catch us and pick each pubic hair from our bodies. Like so much that happened there, when you put it in words and see it on paper, it sounds too unreal to believe. But they were always up to some prank or another, often making work a dangerous sport.<br><br>One day, a woman worker, fed up with the constant haranguing, actually dropped her pants and dared the men to do it. With her pants bunched around her ankles, she stood there in her plain white underwear. The guys backed off her but kept up their nonsense with the rest of us. I knew I'd never do what she did, but I also knew they often made good on their word, one time pinning down one of the new young guys and picking him clean. I went home and found one of Charles's knives to carry in my pocket, the hard leather sheath resting against my thigh in case they ever decided to test me.<br><br>Countless times throughout the years at Goodyear when I needed courage, I remembered how Mama had finally tamed Papa that summer afternoon. I never doubted my mother would have used the butcher knife that day, and in my moments of fear and anger, I never doubted I'd use my own knife if necessary.<br>The place where I grew up during the 1940s is a small bend in the road along the foot of Choccolocco Mountain in northeast Alabama. Just like those pinch-faced gray possums that roamed the pine forests, the people in that small community in the foothills of the Appalachians knew a thing or two about survival. They worked in the cotton or steel mills or scratched a living from the dirt. Some worked in the foundries or the army depot in nearby Anniston or, if they were lucky, had a good-paying job at Goodyear in Gadsden. The folks I knew would walk over broken glass to help a neighbor and just as soon kill you if you did them wrong.<br><br>In 1946, I was in second grade when my father came home from the navy and my parents bought land from Papa to build a slightly bigger house across the road from him. Life started looking up for my family then. It took me a while to adjust to the gleam from the naked bulb hanging off the thin cord from the ceiling, since I'd been so used to the soft glow of gaslight. A couple of years later, we got indoor plumbing and things really changed for the better. Gone were the days of tiptoeing through the wet grass in the black of night, wondering if I'd step on a rattlesnake on the way to the outhouse.<br><br>Our new house wasn't much to look at, but we were lucky. We were the only ones in Possum Trot, besides the brick mason, who owned a television. Daddy worked the night shift at the Anniston Army Depot six days a week, where he reworked engines on the battered military tanks sent home from Korea and later from Vietnam and the Middle East. Before we bought the TV, in the evenings when Daddy was gone, Mama and I had nowhere to go and nothing to do--except for Saturday evening, when we turned on the radio, silent all week to save batteries, and listened to the Grand Ole Opry. But once we got the TV, folks gathered in every corner and doorway of our small house many evenings to watch the nightly news.<br><br>During the day, I had to come up with my own entertainment, and I ran wild, disappearing for hours to climb trees and explore the woods. My cousin Louise and I spent entire days searching for caves or hunting for arrowheads in the Indian cemetery. We also loved to mimic the holy dancing we saw at the church campground down the road.<br><br>Despite these wistful memories, nearly all of my childhood was spent in endless work. In the misty summer mornings Mama and I picked beans and okra before the sun started blazing down on us. After we headed back to the house to bathe and change, we spent the rest of the day hulling peas, skinning tomatoes, and blanching vegetables to can for the winter. We only stopped canning to sleep. On the weekends we roamed the woods to fill our syrup buckets with huckleberries and blackberries for jam and cobbler, slapping the itchy bites from the invisible chiggers with Listerine to keep them from driving us crazy.<br><br>Growing up, I never lacked for essentials, and I certainly never went hungry. I knew we were better off than a good many folks. Of course, I was also painfully aware that we weren't as well off as some others--like my best friend, Sandra. I'd known her since first grade. While I wore homemade bloomers, Sandra could afford silk panties. Every day she came to school in a coordinated sweater and skirt, never without a perfect strand of pearls. Even the teachers called her "little princess."<br><br>Sandra's family lived in New Liberty, a neighborhood where no one whitewashed their trees or kept chickens running around the front yard. There, children didn't have to share a bedroom with their grandmother, like I did. Sitting in front of the large mirror at Sandra's elegant dressing table, I'd angle her hand mirror every which way to see my reflection, hoping to improve my profile. But there it always was, clear as day, the bump in the middle of my nose, the same mysterious Indian nose as Granny Mac's and Daddy's.<br><br>Every time I came home from Sandra's, I felt inferior. Just the sight of my dingy white house and dusty dirt yard made me ashamed even though I knew how far we'd come. I dared not say anything about my disappointment. I saw how hard my parents worked. But the older I got, the more transparent the differences in my life and Sandra's became, and my sense of embarrassment stayed with me, as indelible as a birthmark. I was keenly aware that all this privilege was due to Goodyear, where Sandra's father worked. New Liberty was where the Goodyear families lived. And it's where, more than anywhere, I wanted to be.<br><br>I used to stare at the Goodyear plant when I passed it on my annual summer Greyhound bus trip to Aunt Mattie Bell and Uncle Hoyt's small duplex house in Gadsden. Right before you got into town, there was the plant, next to the Coosa River. A giant redbrick building with slits for windows, it sprawled for blocks behind a tall steel fence like a fortress. The huge smokestacks billowed black smoke. Riding past the plant, I dreamed about what it would have been like to ride around in a brand-new Mercury every few years like Sandra. Or I imagined swimming in the Gulf Coast during spring break like she did. I even fantasized about how smooth my hands would be if my daddy worked at Goodyear. Maybe even best of all, if he did, I'd never have to pick cotton again.<br>All my life I'd been surrounded by one continuous cotton field. I started picking cotton there before I entered first grade and had been picking ever since. It was the only job around, and I was in the field every weekend with my cousin Louise making extra money for the family. When I was older, during the summer Louise and I chopped cotton before it matured in order to earn some spending money of our own. We slung our hoes into the ground, attacking the johnsongrass that spread like gossip between the rows, sputtering complaints to each other that we dared not offer to anyone else. It wasn't just the cotton. When we picked corn, we bellyached the same way, row after row, as cornstalks slapped our bare necks and scratched our hands.<br><br>At the end of the day, two men shouldered a pole between them and hooked our sack of cotton onto the P ring as Papa--all six foot five of him--loomed above me and slid a heavy metal ball across the bar to determine how many pounds we'd plucked from the prickly stalks. It took days to fill our long, skinny sacks. Sometimes it felt like I was trying to fill the sack with clouds.</p><h2>They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South</h2><p><b>A bold and searing investigation into the role of white women in the American slave economy</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Bridging women&#x2019;s history, the history of the South, and African American history, this book makes a bold argument about the role of white women in American slavery. Historian Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers draws on a variety of sources to show that slave-owning women were sophisticated economic actors who directly engaged in and benefited from the South&#x2019;s slave market. Because women typically inherited more slaves than land, enslaved people were often their primary source of wealth. Not only did white women often refuse to cede ownership of their slaves to their husbands, they employed management techniques that were as effective and brutal as those used by slave-owning men. White women actively participated in the slave market, profited from it, and used it for economic and social empowerment. By examining the economically entangled lives of enslaved people and slave-owning women, Jones-Rogers presents a narrative that forces us to rethink the economics and social conventions of slaveholding America.</p><p>Drawing upon a variety of sources to examine the economically entangled lives of enslaved people and slave-owning women, Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers reveals the key role of white women within the slave market. Full of new insights, this volume sheds important light on both American slavery and women&#x2019;s history.<b>Stephanie E.

When scientists theorized a link between saturated fat and heart disease, industry, media, and government joined forces to label fat a greasy killer, best avoided. But according to Jennifer McLagan, not only is our fat phobia overwrought, it also hasn&#x2019;t benefited us in any way. Instead it has driven us into the arms of trans fats and refined carbohydrates, and fostered punitive, dreary attitudes toward food&#x2013;that wellspring of life and pleasure. <br><br> In <i>Fat</i>, McLagan sets out with equal parts passion, scholarship, and appetite to win us back to a healthy relationship with animal fats. She starts by defusing fat&#x2019;s bad rap, both reminding us of what we already know&#x2013;that fat is fundamental to the flavor of our food&#x2013;and enlightening us with the many ways fat (yes, even animal fat) is indispensable to our health. <br><br> Mostly, though, <i>Fat</i> is about pleasures&#x2013;the satisfactions of handling good ingredients skillfully, learning the cultural associations of these primal foodstuffs, recollecting and creating personal memories of beloved dishes, and gratifying the palate and the soul with fat&#x2019;s irreplaceable savor. <i>Fat</i> lavishes the reader with more than 100 recipes from simple to intricate, classic to contemporary, including:<br><br> � Butter-Poached Scallops<br> � Homemade Butter<br> � Carnitas<br> � Duck Confit<br>� Prosciutto-Wrapped Halibut with Sage Butter<br> � Steak and Kidney Pie<br>� Salted Butter Tart<br>&nbsp;<br> Observing that though we now know everything about olive oil, we may not know what to do with lard or bone marrow, McLagan offers extensive guidance on sourcing, rendering, flavoring, using, and storing animal fats, whether butter or bacon, schmaltz or suet. Stories, lore, quotations, and tips touching on fat&#x2019;s place in the kitchen and in the larger culture round out this rich and unapologetic celebration of food at its very best.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><p><strong>Jennifer McLagan's Pumpkin and Bacon Soup</strong> <p></p> <p><strong>Jennifer McLagan</strong> is a chef, food stylist, and writer who has worked in London and Paris as well as her native Australia.

Adventures and Lessons from an Unexpected Public Life</h2><p>A revelatory memoir by the former secretary of state and White House chief of staff describes his behind-the-scenes witness to numerous political machinations, in an account in which he discusses the Iran-Contra scandal, the Reagan assassination attempt, and the 2000 election in Florida. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>White House chief of staff twice over, former secretary of state, past secretary of the treasury, and campaign leader for three different candidates in five successful campaigns&#x2014; few people have lived and breathed politics as deeply or for as long as James Baker. Now, with candor, down-home Texas storytelling, and more than a few surprises, Baker opens up about his thirty-five years behind the scenes.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning in 1975 with the Ford administration, in a job procured for him by friend and tennis partner George H. W. Bush, Baker was in the thick of American politics. He recounts the inside story of Ford&#x2019; s rejection of Reagan as a running mate in 1976 with the same insight he has into Reagan&#x2019; s rejection of Ford four years later. When the White House was plunged into turmoil after the Reagan assassination attempt, he was there, and his stories take readers deeper into those chaotic days. Baker was on hand for the George H. W. Bush campaign&#x2019; s battle over running mate Dan Quayle and, more recently, he was again on the front row as George W. Bush fought it out in Florida. Spellbinding and frank, his stories are the ones between the lines of our history books.<br><br>In this new edition, Baker also responds for the first time in print to the George W. Bush administration&#x2019; s reaction to the Iraq Study Group Report, written with his input.&nbsp; Baker is very qualified to comment on the political operation of the current administration, and his new writing for this paperback brings the full weight of his experience to bear.<br><br>James A. Baker III, served as Chief of Staff to Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush; Under Secretary of Commerce to Gerald Ford; Secretary of the Treasury to Reagan; and Secretary of State to Bush. He has also undertaken special envoy missions for George W. Bush and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on matters such as Iraqi debt relief and the conflict in the Western Sahara.

Brown explores the rich heritage of symbolism that has characterized temples and temple worship through the ages, reverently examining the sacred doctrines associated with the gate of heaven. Among many other topics he discusses; Rituals and symbols from the Tabernacle of Moses, the Temple of Solomon, and the holy places of the earliest Christians. The remarkable parallels between ancient temple worship and the doctrines and ordiances restored by Joseph Smith. Personages from the spirit world who returned to earth to requiest temple work, to assist with this work, or to witness their own work being done. The restored doctrine of making one&#39;s calling and election sure. Long-standing myths about LDS temple worship and the origin, symbols, and rituals of Freemasonry.</p><p>Matthew Brown has a degree in history from BYU. His first book, Symbols in stone: Symbolism on the Early Temples of the Restoration, with Paul Thomas Smith, has been praised for maintaining an impressive balance between manifesting discreet respect for sacred matters while at the same time providing genuine insight. A longtime student of Church history and temple symbolism, Matt has a passionate interest in shedding light on the events, the historical figures, and the doctrines of the Restoration.</p><h2>Phasma (Star Wars): Journey to Star Wars: The Last Jedi</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER � Discover Captain Phasma&#x2019;s mysterious history in this &#x201c;Journey to <i>Star Wars:</i> <i>The Last Jedi</i>&#x201d; novel.</b><br><br> One of the most cunning and merciless officers of the First Order, Captain Phasma commands the favor of her superiors, the respect of her peers, and the terror of her enemies. But for all her renown, Phasma remains as virtually unknown as the impassive expression on her gleaming chrome helmet. Now, an adversary is bent on unearthing her mysterious origins&#x2014;and exposing a secret she guards as zealously and ruthlessly as she serves her masters.<br><br>Deep inside the Battlecruiser <i>Absolution,</i> a captured Resistance spy endures brutal interrogation at the hands of a crimson-armored stormtrooper&#x2014;Cardinal. But the information he desires has nothing to do with the Resistance or its covert operations against the First Order.<br><br>What the mysterious stormtrooper wants is Phasma&#x2019;s past&#x2014;and with it whatever long-buried scandal, treachery, or private demons he can wield against the hated rival who threatens his own power and privilege in the ranks of the First Order. His prisoner has what Cardinal so desperately seeks, but she won&#x2019;t surrender it easily. As she wages a painstaking war of wills with her captor, bargaining for her life in exchange for every precious revelation, the spellbinding chronicle of the inscrutable Phasma unfolds.

She lives in Florida with her family and a fat mutt named Merle.Vi was trained to remember every detail when it counts, but even she can&#x2019;t keep up with the labyrinthine twists and turns of the enormous Star Destroyer&#x2019;s guts. Long hallways end and intersect, and turbolifts up and down make it impossible for her to recall their route. It&#x2019;s one thing to see pictures of ships like this one, but it&#x2019;s another thing to really understand the enormity of their enemy&#x2019;s resources. As he guides her into another lift, the man in red stands in front of the panel so she can&#x2019;t see which level they&#x2019;re headed to. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your place or mine?&#x201d; Vi asks, hoping to goad him into moving aside. <br> &nbsp;<br> But the man in red is silent, the gun always rammed into some soft place on her body and the spherical droid floating by his side. Her leather jacket has built-in armor plating, but it wouldn&#x2019;t do much to stop a fatal shot at this distance. Thing is, she knows he&#x2019;s not going to shoot her. But she has to play along. When she slowly begins to take her hands down, he clicks his tongue at her. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tsk. Hands on head. You know how this works, scum.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The blaster shoves into her kidney, and her hands go right back up. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;m not scum. I don&#x2019;t know who you think I am, but I&#x2019;m just a trader. Maybe I smuggle a little, but who doesn&#x2019;t? And wouldn&#x2019;t that be the New Republic&#x2019;s jurisdiction, anyway? Did I travel back in time? Shouldn&#x2019;t I be in a cell, waiting to speak to some cadaverous bureaucrat in a jaunty hat?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The lift door slides open, and he shoves her out into a hall that&#x2019;s downright dungeonous. They didn&#x2019;t see anyone farther up, and Vi is willing to bet that&#x2019;s due to a combination of this trooper&#x2019;s knowledge of the ship&#x2019;s rigorous schedule and his droid&#x2019;s meddling, as it sometimes pushed ahead to lead. But down here&#x2014;well, it&#x2019;s clear nobody goes down here. Except people doing things they shouldn&#x2019;t be doing. <br> &nbsp;<br> The lighting is dim and flickering, and there&#x2019;s something dripping, maybe runoff from the vent system. They&#x2019;re deep in the bowels of the Star Destroyer, then, in an area that&#x2019;s generally off-limits or beneath notice. And that&#x2019;s not good for Vi. Even the First Order has rules, and the red trooper is breaking them. If this guy kills her, he won&#x2019;t even have to do datawork. She&#x2019;ll just be another load of garbage sliding down toward the incinerator. <br> &nbsp;<br> Great. The Resistance doesn&#x2019;t know much about the enemy they&#x2019;re facing, and the New Republic doesn&#x2019;t consider them a threat, which means Vi hasn&#x2019;t been briefed on the protocol these people generally follow. She doesn&#x2019;t know what to expect. She&#x2019;s been trained to resist interrogation, but she also doesn&#x2019;t know what new toys this guy in red might have. A chill trickles down her spine. She might be in over her head. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They put you in the penthouse, huh, Emergency Brake?&#x201d; she says, because she always babbles when truly worried. &#x201c;Top-notch accommodations. Can we get room service?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The blaster doesn&#x2019;t leave her spine. Her captor gives her directions&#x2014; turn here, turn there&#x2014;but doesn&#x2019;t respond to her taunting. Finally, he presses a long code into a control panel on the wall, and a door slides open far less smoothly than Vi would expect in what&#x2019;s obviously a new ship. The room inside is colder than it should be and smells of moisture, metal, and, no point in denying it, blood. The spherical droid hurries inside first and turns off the cams, one by one. Vi pauses on the threshold, but the trooper finally touches her, shoving her hard with a gloved hand so that she stumbles to her knees, her fingers curling into a rusty grate set in the floor. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get up.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You really know how to treat a girl right.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He reaches into her jacket&#x2019;s collar and hauls her to her feet, spinning her around. She staggers into the wall, putting her back against the cold metal. The room isn&#x2019;t large, maybe three meters by four, and it clearly has only one use: interrogation. Well, two uses, if you count torture. Three, if you include the inevitable death promised by the fact that she&#x2019;s not going to give up any intel on the Resistance. The space is dominated by an interrogation chair, and the only other furnishings are a simple table and two rickety metal chairs, a place for the bad guys to sit down with a cup of caf and go over their notes while their victim bleeds out, probably. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hope the linens are clean.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> He shakes his head like he&#x2019;s disappointed, grabs her jacket lapels, and drags her to the interrogation chair. They call it a chair, but it&#x2019;s actually like a gurney standing on end with metal pincers to restrain her head, chest, and wrists as she stands on the metal lip. As part of her training, Vi was shown dozens of images of such machines ranging back from the days of the Empire&#x2019;s Inquisitors to more sophisticated units currently being manufactured for Hutts and other thugs with too much money and a need to get information while keeping their slimy hands clean. This unit, she&#x2019;s sad to notice, has life-support capabilities and a mind probe, which means her captor can bypass discussion and go straight to her brain. Vi has been trained to withstand fists and weapons, but no one has yet found a way to evade direct attacks on the nervous system. She contemplates the poison tooth implanted in the back of her jaw for the first time, running her tongue over it as her captor snaps the metal manacles closed around her arms and torso. <br> &nbsp;<br> She won&#x2019;t bite down yet. There&#x2019;s still a way out of here. There has to be. With everything she knows now, surviving will mean major strides for the Resistance. They&#x2019;ll have a better idea of what they&#x2019;re truly fighting, in numbers, technology, and enemy mindset. But that means she&#x2019;s got to find a way to live through this interrogation with her mind and body intact. And that means she&#x2019;s got to stop focusing on her own predicament and start paying attention to her enemy and what makes him tick. <br> &nbsp;<br> Luckily, she knows a lot more about him than he knows about her. <br> &nbsp;<br> After strapping her in, he checks the panel monitoring her vital signs, flicking it with a finger. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your heart rate is up,&#x201d; he notes. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, well, I&#x2019;m strapped into a torture chair, standing on somebody else&#x2019;s dried blood. Seems like a natural response.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got something to hide.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who doesn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> His red helmet tips, just a fraction, conceding the point. As she watches him, he moves around the edges of the room, double-checking the cam feeds his droid already shut off, as well as what she&#x2019;d guess is the comm system. The droid hovers ominously beside his shoulder, and he makes the rounds slowly, as if giving a warning. <br> &nbsp;<br> This is not official.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This is off the record.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> No one else is watching.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> There will be no interruptions, no reprieves.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This is not how the First Order does things.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So this is personal,&#x201d; Vi notes.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We shall see. It&#x2019;s up to you. We can do this the easy way or the hard way.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Vi wiggles, testing the strength of her bonds. &#x201c;Letting me go would be really, really easy. Besides, you can search me all you want, but I don&#x2019;t have anything useful. Let your boys tear my ship apart, deconstruct my droid, unravel my sweater, poke around in my brain all day. Whoever you think I am, you&#x2019;re wrong. I&#x2019;m just a harmless passerby.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> He stands before her now, legs spread and arms crossed. His blaster is clipped on his hip, red and gleaming. His red-gloved fingers tap against it, another reminder. It&#x2019;s just the two of them and his droid. Anything could happen. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You are Vi Moradi, code name Starling, known Resistance spy. And you have the very intel I need.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re the Big Red Button. What happens if I poke you in the chest? Does a light turn on somewhere? Does something explode?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t deny it?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> She would shrug if she weren&#x2019;t manacled and strapped down. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one running the torture, so you&#x2019;re the one who gets to decide what&#x2019;s true and what&#x2019;s not.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You were on Parnassos.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Vi is too well trained to grin.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Was I? And what&#x2019;s so important about Parnassos?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her captor considers her. &#x201c;Nothing. That&#x2019;s the point. Now tell me what you know about Captain Phasma.&#x201d;</p><h2>Trek Of The Mountain Man (The Last Mountain Man, Book 30)</h2><p>When a greedy bounty hunter, believing that he can use an old warrant and still get a $10,000 reward for killing Smoke Jensen, kidnaps Smoke&#39;s woman, Smoke, hell-bent on revenge, sets out to rescue her in a blaze of glory that will only leave one man standing--Smoke Jensen.

Pat's new job at a gallery seems easy enough. Her boss spends most of his time drinking coffee in a local cafe and discussing matters great and small, and Pat's duties are light. That is until she realizes that one of their paintings may be an undiscovered work of a renowned Scottish artist and she discovers that one of their customers may be in on the secret. Add to this a fancy ball, love triangles and an encounter with a famous crime writer, and you have Alexander McCall Smith's entertaining and witty portrait of Edinburgh society.McCall Smith is a Professor of Medical Law as well as an author who has written over 50 books on a wide range of subjects: from Forensic Aspects of Sleep to The Criminal Law of Botswana, The Perfect Hamburger (children&#39;s fiction) to The 2 1/2 Pillars of Wisdom.</p><h2>Wizard and Glass (Revised Edition): The Dark Tower IV</h2><p><b>The fourth volume in Stephen King's acclaimed, epic Dark Tower series </b><br><br>Roland and his band have narrowly escaped the city of Lud and boarded Blaine, a train that will take them to, of all places, Kansas, where the ghost city of Topeka has been depopulated by a superflu and where, alongside Interstate 70, an emerald palace rises enchantingly. Before Roland and the companions of his "ka-tet" continue along the Path of the Bean, Roland must tell his companions the tale that defines him both as a man and hero, a long-ago romance of witchery and evil, of the beautiful, unforgettable Susan Delgado, of the Big Coffin Hunters and Reah of the Coos. And when his tale is finished, Roland confronts a man who goes by many names, a man who "darkles and tincts" and who holds perhaps the key to the Dark Tower. <br><p>The stunning Plume edition features full-color illustrations by Dave McKean and is a collector&#x2019;s item for years to come.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p>Frank Muller, the recognized virtuoso of audiobook narration (<i>The Green Mile</i>, <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>), takes on Stephen King's Goliath tale of sorcerers, time travelers, and sci-fi love.

It was 28 degrees outside, the jean jacket was all he wore, and he wasn&#x2019;t shivering; the ?ask probably had something to do with that.</p><p>&#x201c;Now we only use the shovels when dirt clods roll into the grave from the backhoe.&#x201d; The tiny man took a sip from the ?ask and continued the throes of philosophic debate. &#x201c;The traditional Chinese cof?n is rectangular with three humps, and they won&#x2019;t bury you wearing red &#x2019;cause you&#x2019;ll turn into a ghost.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded and did my best to stand still in the wind. He took another sip and didn&#x2019;t offer me any.</p><p>&#x201c;The ancient Egyptians had their essential organs removed and put in jars.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded some more.</p><p>&#x201c;The Hindus burn the body, a practice I admire, but we cremated my uncle Milo and ended up losing him when his top came loose and he fell through the holes in the rusted ?oorboard of a Willy&#x2019;s Jeepster on the Upper Powder River Road.&#x201d; He thought about it, shaking his head at the ignominious end. &#x201c;That ain&#x2019;t where I wanna spend eternity.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded again and looked off toward the Big Horn Mountains, where it continued to snow. Somehow bon?res seemed more romantic than construction equipment or Willy&#x2019;s Jeepsters, for that matter.</p><p>&#x201c;The Vikings used to stick &#x2019;em a?re on a boat with all their stuff and shove out to sea, but that seems like an awful waste of stuff, not to mention a perfectly good boat.&#x201d; He paused, but continued. &#x201c;Vikings considered death to be just another voyage and you never knew what you could end up needing, so you might as well take it all with you.&#x201d; The jackleg carpenter turned his ferocious blue eyes toward me and took another sip in honor of his ancestors, still not offering me any.</p><p>I buried my hands in my duty jacket, straining the embroidered star of the Absaroka County Sheriff &#x2019;s Of?ce, and dropped my head a little as he kept on talking. I had seen Jules on a professional basis as a lodger at the jail when the nephew of the previous sheriff, and deputy of mine at the time, had picked him up for public intoxication and had beaten him. I had in turn beaten Turk, much to the dismay of my receptionist/dispatcher Ruby, and then turned him over to the highway patrol in hopes that a more structured environment might do him some good.</p><p>&#x201c;The Mongols used to ride the body on a horse till it fell off.&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed deeply, but Jules didn&#x2019;t seem to notice.</p><p>&#x201c;The Plains Indians probably had it right with the burial scaffolding; if you aren&#x2019;t up to anything else, you might as well feed the buzzards.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t stand it anymore. &#x201c;Jules?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep?&#x201d;</p><p>I turned and looked down at him. &#x201c;Do you ever shut up?&#x201d;</p><p>He tipped his battered cowboy hat back on his head and took the ?nal swig, still smiling. &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded my ?nal nod, turned, and tramped my way down the hill away from the aged cottonwood at the fence line, where I had already worn a path in the snow. Jules had been there on my three previous visits, and he knew my pattern.</p><p>I guess gravedigging got lonely.</p><p>You can tell the new graves by the pristine markers and the mounds of earth. From my numerous and one-sided conversations, I had learned that there were water lines running a patchwork under the graveyard with faucets that would be used in the spring to help soak the dirt and tamp the new ones ?at but, for now, it was as if the ground had refused to accept Vonnie Hayes. It had been almost a month since her death, and I found myself up here once a week.</p><p>When somebody like Vonnie dies you expect the world to stop, and maybe for one brief second the world does take notice. Maybe it&#x2019;s not the world outside, but the world inside that&#x2019;s still.</p><p>It took about ten minutes to get back to the IGA in the center of Durant where I had left my erstwhile deputy to shanghai prospective jurors for the local judicial system. I rolled into the parking lot, scratched my beard as I parked, and looked at the plastic-wrapped bundles of wood priced at two for seven bucks that were stacked at the entrance of the grocery store. We had been forced to act as the Absaroka County press gang about eight times during my tenure as sheriff, which itself had taken up almost a quarter of a century. The jury wheels used by the county were chocked so full of outdated records that a large percentage of the summonses were returned undeliverable, and the ones that did get where they were supposed to go many times got ignored. My advice that we simply put occupant on the things was dismissed out of hand.</p><p>I looked at the handsome woman at the entrance of the grocery store with the clipboard in her hands. Victoria Moretti didn&#x2019;t like being called handsome, but that&#x2019;s how I thought of her. Her features were a little too pronounced to be dismissed as pretty. The jaw was just a little too strong, the tarnished gold eyes just a little too sharp. She was like one of those beautiful saltwater ?sh in one of those tanks you knew better than to stick your hand into; you didn&#x2019;t even tap on the glass.</p><p>&#x201c;Of all the shitty things you make me do, I think I hate this the most. I have an undergraduate degree in law enforcement, I&#x2019;ve forgotten how many hours toward a masters, graduated from the Philadelphia Police Academy in the top ?ve percent. I had four years street duty, two ?eld commendations...I am your most senior of?cer.&#x201d; I felt a sharp jab at my midriff. &#x201c;Are you fucking listening to me?&#x201d;</p><p>I watched as my highly capable and awarded deputy accosted a middle-aged man in a barn coat, copied down information from his driver&#x2019;s license, and informed him that he needed to get over to the courthouse pronto or be faced with contempt of court. &#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s another notch on my Glock.&#x201d;</p><p>I watched as the hapless shopper balanced his purchases and wandered off to his car. &#x201c;Hey, there are worse places for a stakeout, at least we&#x2019;ve got plenty of supplies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s supposed to snow another eight inches tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked over at the neatly shoveled driveways. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. You can go in and ?ush them out, and you can do some last minute shopping.&#x201d; I was tapping on the glass and getting my tarnished gold&#x2019;s worth. &#x201c;How many more talis jurors do we need?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two.&#x201d; She searched the automatic glass doors behind us. Dan Crawford stood at the far register, registering his annoyance at our of?cial abuse of his customer base. She looked back at me. &#x201c;Talis jurors?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The process started in this country with the Boston Massacre. They pulled spectators out of the courtroom gallery to serve as jurors during the trial of a British soldier. It&#x2019;s from the Latin, meaning bystander. You&#x2019;re Italian, you should understand these things.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m from Philadelphia, where we vote early and often, and everybody on the jury has a vowel on the end of his name.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked off toward the mountains west of town and at the broiling darkness that seemed to be waiting behind the range. I couldn&#x2019;t help but think that it would be a nice evening to sit by the ?re. Red Road Contracting had promised to have my triple-walled ?ume put in by last weekend, but so far all they had done was cut an opening in my roof the size of a large porthole. They said the ?rebox that mounted to the ceiling would cover the hole, but for now the only thing between the inside of my snug little log cabin and the impending great outdoors was ten millimeters of plastic and some duct tape. It wasn&#x2019;t really their fault. The coal-bed methane out?ts were paying close to twenty dollars an hour, roughly twice what general contracting paid anywhere on the high plains, so Danny Pretty On Top had signed on with Powder River Energy Exploration and had left Charlie Small Horse to pick up the slack.</p><p>&#x201c;How about I go in and ?ush &#x2019;em out?&#x201d; she said. I looked down at her. &#x201c;I just want to get back and shoot your dog if he&#x2019;s shit in my of?ce again.&#x201d;</p><p>I had suspected an underlying motive. The beast did; it was true. I hadn&#x2019;t had him all that long, and he had decided that rather than go to the trouble of going all the way to the door and having Ruby let him out, he would just wander across the hall and unload in Vic&#x2019;s of?ce. &#x201c;He likes you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I like him, too. But I&#x2019;m going to shoot him in the ass if he leaves another little package for me.&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed and thought about how nice it would be to go back to the warmth of my of?ce. &#x201c;Okay, go ahead.&#x201d; It was like turning loose the dogs of war; her eyes grew cold, the mouth curved lupine, and she turned and disappeared.</p><p>If it did snow tonight, the whole county would be thrown into a frozen panic, court would be canceled anyway, and my little department would likely be stretched to the limit. Jim Ferguson was only a part-time deputy and Turk was already gone to the highway patrol, so Vic pretty much made up the staff; but we had a potential candidate for Turk&#x2019;s job. He was a Mexican kid who had ?nished up at the Wyoming Law Enforcement Academy, had elected to begin his career in Kemmerer, and then had moved to the state&#x2019;s maximum-security prison. After two years there, it would appear that he had changed his mind and was looking for rosier pastures. He was supposed to drive up from Rawlins in the morning for an interview, but I wasn&#x2019;t holding out much hope. He would have to gun it over Muddy Gap at 6,250 feet through the Rattlesnake range and then up the basin to the foot of the Big Horns and Durant. It was a ?ve-hour trip on dry roads and, looking at the mountains, that didn&#x2019;t seem possible. It appeared as though we were going to get our third heavy snowstorm since fall: the ?rst had tried to kill me on the mountain, and the other I had enjoyed from a stool at my friend Henry Standing Bear&#x2019;s bar, the Red Pony.</p><p>It was just after Thanksgiving, and we had consumed the better part of a bottle of single malt scotch. When I woke up the next morning, Henry had already pulled a couple of leatherette chairs in front of a double ?fty-gallon drum stove. I slipped off the sleeping bag and swung my legs over the side of the pool table on which I had fallen asleep and tried to feel the muscles in my face. He had hauled his bag with him and sat hunched over the stove. I watched as steam blew out with my breath, and I scrambled to get the down-?lled bag back around me. &#x201c;Heat&#x2019;s off.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned his head, and the dark eyes looked through the silver strands in the black curtain of his hair. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; I joined him at the stove in my socks. The ?oor was cold, and I regretted not slipping on my boots. &#x201c;Do you want some coffee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then go and make some. I am the one who built the ?re.&#x201d;</p><p>I found the ?lters and the tin of already ground coffee on the second shelf of the bar. I had lots of little bags of expensive beans that my daughter had sent me when she was a law student in Seattle. Cady was now a lawyer in Philadelphia, and I still hadn&#x2019;t gotten around to getting a grinder. Henry Standing Bear had a grinder. The Bear had a vegetable mandoline, and I didn&#x2019;t know anybody else who had one of those.</p><p>I started the coffee, hopped back over to the ?re, and grabbed my boots along the way. The windows had begun to freeze on the inside. &#x201c;How come the water hasn&#x2019;t frozen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Heat tape.&#x201d;</p><p>I pulled my boots on and gathered the sleeping bag back around me. &#x201c;You out of propane?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The heater never works when it is really cold.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s convenient.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, in the summer it works perfectly.&#x201d;</p><p>We sat there for a while, the homemade stove just beginning to warm the northeast corner of the little building or at least the sixteen inches between it and us. I yawned and watched as he yawned, too. He was studying me again. We hadn&#x2019;t talked in the last few days; there had been too much to say. We watched as the bottom barrel began to tic and grow red.</p><p>&#x201c;Dena go to that pool tournament in Vegas?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that a good thing or a bad thing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have not yet decided.&#x201d;</p><p>It felt good there with that strange feeling of being in a public place without the public. I was going to have to call and check in, but it was still early on a Sunday, our slowest day of the week. I was avoiding it, mostly because I would get caught talking to Lucian. He had a few strange ideas about some goings on out at the Durant Home for Assisted Living and had become a kind of Absaroka County Agatha Christie. I told him that if anybody shortened the span of any of the occupants they wouldn&#x2019;t be robbing them of all that much, and he reminded me that he would be happy to take me by my mutilated, half-century old ear and march me around the block. Ever since I had hired the retired sheriff as a part-time dispatcher on weekends, he had been gathering his salt.</p><p>I looked out through the haloed light of a high-plains winter at the falling snow with ?akes the size of poker chips. I had had inclinations that it was going to be a winter to remember, and so far I had been right. The day before Thanksgiving, Cady had been trapped at the Philadelphia airport; she had been trying to get back to Wyoming for a surprise visit. I hadn&#x2019;t been feeling well and, after getting through one of the toughest cases of my life, she could tell. Cady had called, ?lled with tears and frustrated fury at a two-fold snowstorm that had grounded planes on both the eastern seaboard and in Denver, the hub to our part of the world. They had assured her that even if she did make it there, she would be spending the holiday at DIA. We talked for an hour and forty-two minutes. She was laughing that heartfelt laugh of hers by the time we were done, the one that matched her deep rustic voice, and I felt better.</p><p>&#x201c;Dena says she is moving to Las Vegas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>The coffee was done, so I pulled the sleeping bag up a little higher on my shoulders and towed it over to the bar with me; I must have looked like a giant praying mantis. I poured myself a cup and got the heavy cream the Bear kept in the bar refrigerator. I added the cream to his and dumped in what I considered a reasonable amount of sugar, dropped a spoon in, and carried it over to him; I ?gured the least he could do was stir the thing himself. I handed him the Sturgis mug and sat back down. &#x201c;Things could be worse.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how is that?&#x201d;</p><p>I took a sip of my coffee for dramatic effect. &#x201c;You could have been dating a murderer.&#x201d; I watched as the big shoulders shifted, and he stared at me. It felt wrong, saying it like that. It was disrespectful of somebody I still cared a great deal about. &#x201c;I guess everybody&#x2019;s a little nervous about talking to me, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes were steady. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t say anything. &#x201c;I am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head and looked at the stove. It was warming up a little in our corner of the world, so I shrugged the bag down off my shoulders. &#x201c;Are you going to say anything in this conversation besides yes?&#x201d; I quickly added. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t answer that.&#x201d;&lt;...</p></p><h2>Sacrament Time</h2><p>Brief text, photographs, and Bible verses help convey the significance of the sacrament in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><p></p><h2>Essentials of the Earth: An Encyclopedia of Oils, Blends and Applications</h2><p>Essentials of the Earth - 6th Edition, October 2016, is a concise, user-friendly guide to essential oils, with all the latest updates in its 282 pages.

Keegan was the author of numerous books including <i>The Face of Battle</i>, <i>The Mask of Command</i>, <i>The Price of Admiralty</i>,<i> Six Armies in Normandy</i>, and <i>The Second World War</i>, and was a fellow at the Royal Society of Literature.</p>The author of The Mask of Command here describes and analyzes four landmark naval engagements, each featuring a different type of ship. The engagements: the 1805 British victory over the French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar; the WW I battle of Jutland; the decisive defeat by U.S. naval forces, mainly carrier planes, of a Japanese task force at Midway in 1942; and the prolonged struggle between Allied convoys and German U-boats in WW II known as the Battle of the Atlantic. Tracing the evolution from wooden sailing ships to ironclad steamships and then to aircraft carriers and submarines, Keegan includes a detailed description of life abroad the ships and provides the strategic background of each of the battles. He is especially keen on the shipwright's art, explaining among other things how the vessels were constructed to withstand bombardment. In this, his first book-length venture into naval history, Keegan writes as authoritatively as his admirers have come to expect. His chapter on Trafalgar is especially fine.

The Confederacy, with no fleet of its own, built an iron fort containing ten heavy guns on the hull of a captured Union frigate named the <i>Merrimack</i>. The North got word of the project when it was already well along, and, in desperation, commissioned an eccentric inventor named John Ericsson to build the <i>Monitor</i>, an entirely revolutionary iron warship&#x2014;at the time, the single most complicated machine ever made. Abraham Lincoln himself was closely involved with the ship&#x2019;s design. Rushed through to completion in just 100 days, it mounted only two guns, but they were housed in a shot-proof revolving turret. The ship hurried south from Brooklyn (and nearly sank twice on the voyage), only to arrive to find the <i>Merrimack </i>had arrived blazing that morning, destroyed half the Union fleet, and would be back to finish the job the next day. When she returned, the <i>Monitor </i>was there. She fought the <i>Merrimack</i> to a standstill, and saved the Union cause. As soon as word of the battle spread, Great Britain&#x2014;the foremost sea power of the day&#x2014;ceased work on all wooden ships. A thousand-year-old tradition ended, and the path to the naval future opened.<br> <br> Richly illustrated with photos, maps, and engravings, <i>Iron Dawn</i> is the irresistible story of these incredible, intimidating war machines. Historian Richard Snow brings to vivid life the tensions of the time, explaining how wooden and ironclad ships worked, maneuvered, battled, and sank. This full account of the <i>Merrimack</i> and <i>Monitor</i> has never been told in such immediate, compelling detail.</p><p>Richard Snow spent nearly four decades at&nbsp;<i>American Heritage&nbsp;</i>magazine, serving as editor in chief for seventeen years, and has been a consultant on historical motion pictures, among them <i>Glory</i>, and has written for documentaries, including the Burns brothers&#x2019;&nbsp;<i>Civil War</i>, and Ric Burns&#x2019;s award-winning PBS film&nbsp;<i>Coney Island</i>, whose screenplay he wrote. He is the author of multiple books, including, most recently, <i>Disney&#x2019;s Land</i>."A lively tale of science, war and clashing personalities&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;The charm of <i>Iron Dawn</i> comes from its ability to paddle between the quirky, prosaic world of inventors and bureaucrats and the hell of combat afloat, where death&#x2019;s scythe swings as swiftly as on land. By keeping a human heart beating inside the keel of two extraordinary machines, <i>Iron Dawn</i> delightfully carries the reader from the Age of Sail to the Age of Iron."<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With muscular vitality, vast knowledge of military technology, and a novelist's gift for capturing vivid detail, Richard Snow retells the story of Civil War ironclads as if it is unfolding before our startled eyes for the first time. The <i>Monitor</i> and <i>Merrimack</i> have never seemed more modern, dangerous, or revolutionary as they reappear in the hands of this master storyteller.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Harold Holzer, author of <i>Lincoln and the Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion</i> and winner of the 2015 Gilder Lehrman Lincoln Prize</b><br><br>&#x201c;A masterful tale of the great Civil War ironclads, those strange, seemingly supernatural ships.&nbsp; One, Richard Snow tells us, looked like a rhinoceros, the other like a 'metal pie plate.'&nbsp; Their story&#x2014;and that of the misunderstandings and maneuverings that preceded the Battle of Hampton Roads&#x2014;is irresistible, nowhere more so than in this crackling, supremely poised account.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Stacy Schiff, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>The Witches, Cleopatra: A Life, </i>and <i>A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America</i></b><br><br>"Everybody knows about the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimack</i>, right? Well, actually, as it turns out, we don't. In <i>Iron Dawn,</i> Richard Snow opens up the vast, enthralling world of politics, war, technology, maritime history, and human drama that lies just back of that momentous battle.

Also included is a preview of the forthcoming sequel, The Things from Another World, by John Gregory Betancourt.</p><p></p><h2>Mrs. Jordan&#39;s Profession: The Actress and the Prince</h2><p>On the London stage ill the late eighteenth century, Dora Jordan was a star, probably the greatest comic actress the British theatre has ever known. Seductive and vivacious. as delightful off-stage as on, she was adored by the public and high society alike. Then, in 1791, she attracted the attentions of Prince William, the Duke of Clarence, third son of King George III. who eventually prevailed upon her to live with him. For more than twenty years. in spite of the attacks of caricaturists and satirists. she was a loyal and loving mate, bearing him ten children, helping to pay his debts out of her earnings as an actress, acting for all intents and purposes as his wife.<br><br>Yet as Claire Tomalin shows in this brilliant rediscovery of Dora Jordan, the idyll had tragedy at its heart. Under pressure from the royal family and moved by his own ambitions, William abandoned her. For Dora, thrown out of her house, estranged from her children, it was a disaster; she was to die in poverty and loneliness in 1816. And while William evidently regretted the loss of the happiness he had known with her, he went on to marry a German princess and take the throne as King William IV in 1830. When his biography was published in 1884, Dora's name did not even appear in it.<br><br>As in The Invisible Woman, her prizewinning biography of Dickens's mistress, Nelly Ternan, Claire Tomalin has here retrieved from obscurity a fascinating and important figure. She also offers us insight into an era. For Dora Jordan's tragedy, growing as it did out of the collision and interweaving of two worlds -- the rough and colorful world of the Georgian theatre where she was at home, and the glittering world of the court and the aristocracy, increasingly shadowed by the pall of convention that would define Victoria's reign -- is a vivid reflection of historical change.<br><br>Yet the story told in Mrs Jordan's Profession is, ultimately, a personal one, a love story with a sad and brutal ending. Its essence lies in the gaiety and charm of Dora singing and joking onstage in Drury Lane, in the accounts of life with the children at 'dear Bushy,' in the notes she wrote to William in the days of happiness and the helpless, mystified letters that followed her dismissal. It is impossible to read without being moved -- and enchanted.</p><p>8 1.5-hour cassettes'This is a riveting biography...[It] conjures up a rich, alluring period which, in its brittle decadence and love of scandal and flamboyance, often seems closer than the nineteenth century to our own times...the wit and razzle-dazzle of Drury Lane...the cat's cradle of partner swapping among the Sheridans, the Royals and Dora recalls Cosi fan tutte...It is the most haunting biography I have read this year.'<p>-- Jackie Wullschlager, Financial Times</p><p>'A brilliant book, even better, if possible, than the author's previous study of Dickens's mistress, The Invisible Woman.'</p><p>-- Antonia Fraser, Literary Review</p><p>'Compelling...beautifully constructed... exceptionally well-written and informed by a vivid sense of the past.'</p><p>-- John Gross, Sunday Telegraph</p><p>'An admirable biography...It is hard to find a fault in her performance.

Lauren Groff cleverly turns this concept on its head in <em>Fates and Furies</em>, demonstrating that sometimes it&#x2019;s what you don&#x2019;t say&#x2014;to protect your partner&#x2019;s vanity, their reputation, their heart&#x2014;that makes a marriage hum. (Until it doesn&#x2019;t.) Broken up into two parts and numerous perspectives, this dazzlingly told tale of one such marriage introduces us to Lotto and Mathilde. The former is an out-of-work actor-turned successful playwright, although some of that success is fueled by forces his ego obscures. And then there&#x2019;s his adoring and enigmatic wife, Mathilde, who we later find out is a far better actor than Lotto ever was. For all the smoke and mirrors, Groff crafts a convincing love story that packs an emotional punch, especially when certain truths are revealed. There is also something satisfying in finding out the extent to which our own perceptions are skewed as the narrative unfolds. The title <em>Fates and Furies</em> is a nod to Greek Tragedy, and this novel revels in the themes befitting one&#x2014;passion, betrayal, vengeance, redemption...You will revel in it, too. <em>&#x2013;Erin Kodicek</em></p><b>Lauren Groff&nbsp;</b>is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times-</i>bestselling author of&nbsp;three novels,&nbsp;<i>The Monsters of Templeton</i>,&nbsp;<i>Arcadia, </i>and <i>Fates and Furies,&nbsp;</i>and the celebrated short-story collection&nbsp;<i>Delicate Edible Birds</i>.

Just as in 1941 he refused to understand that Hitler had broken their non-aggression pact, he was in 1945 unwilling to believe that the dictator had committed suicide in the debris of the Berlin bunker. In his paranoia, Stalin ordered his secret police, the NKVD, precursor to the KGB, to explore in detail every last vestige of the private life of the only man he considered a worthy opponent, and to clarify beyond doubt the circumstances of his death. <p> For months two captives of the Soviet Army--Otto Guensche, Hitler's adjutant, and Heinz Linge, his personal valet--were interrogated daily, their stories crosschecked, until the NKVD were convinced that they had the fullest possible account of the life of the F�hrer. In 1949 they presented their work, in a single copy, to Stalin. It is as remarkable for the depth of its insight into Adolf Hitler--from his specific directions to Linge as to how his body was to be burned, to his sense of humor--as for what it does not say, reflecting the prejudices of the intended reader: Joseph Stalin. Nowhere, for instance, does the dossier criticize Hitler's treatment of the Jews. </p><p> Today, the 413-page original of Stalin's personal biography of Hitler is a Kremlin treasure and it is said to be held in President Putin's safe. The only other copy, made by order of Stalin's successor, Nikita Khrushchev, in 1959, was deposited in Moscow Party archives under the code number 462A. It was there that Henrik Eberle and Matthias Uhl, two German historians, found it. Available to the public in full for the first time, <i>The Hitler Book</i> presents a captivating, astonishing, and deeply revealing portrait of Hitler, Stalin, and the mutual antagonism of these two dictators, who between them wrought devastation on the European continent.</p></p><p><b>Henrik Eberle</b>, a freelance journalist and historian, completed his PhD dissertation in 2002 on the scientific policies of National Socialism. He currently teaches history at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. <b>Matthias Uhl</b> received his PhD in 2000 in East European History at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. He currently is on staff at the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich and Berlin.Few books can offer a more compelling, or a more chilling, glimpse into the minds of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin than THE HITLER BOOK, the recently discovered top-secret dossier commissioned by Stalin. In addition to outlining every aspect of the German dictator's life, behavior, and personality, the book also provides a frightening look into the world of Stalin. Listening to Michael Prichard's low-key reading will cause shivers as listeners gain new insight into the German and Russian mentalities of the era. Prichard reads unobtrusively, as though he were a camera merely trying to capture an event without the participants' awareness. The result is a fascinating, albeit somewhat long, book.

The mental exercise that audio gives to the imagination has more positive effects on kids than the mind-numbing boob tube. Perhaps that&#39;s why, when Disney rereleased some of its postwar kids albums on cassette a few years ago, they were sold out within weeks of hitting the shelves. In this instance, even merely serviceable performance does wonders for Stine&#39;s hack writing. Disney has pumped more energy than creativity into the slickly produced title. It&#39;s amiable, briskly paced and safe. Neither parents nor their offspring will find any unpleasant shocks here.

But in Comtosook, the only discovery Ross can lay claim to is that of Lia Beaumont, a skittish, mysterious woman who, like Ross, is on a search for something beyond the boundary separating life and death.

Do we love across time, or in spite of it?</p><p>Ghosts and ghost hunters collide in this compelling tale of the paranormal set in Vermont's green mountains. When the patriarch of the Abenaki Indian tribe that was nearly eradicated by that state's eugenics project in the 1930s encounters Ross Wakeman, the miraculous survivor of several attempted suicides who wants nothing more than to be reunited with the woman he loved and lost, they set in motion a chain of events that will unravel an ancient murder and lead to a second chance at life and love for the victim's descendants. Picoult, author of <i>Salem Falls</i>, brings the past alive and peoples it with a cast of extraordinarily well-realized characters whose reach into the future touches the lives of a dying boy, a frightened girl, and their mothers--two women who've given up on love until the revenants stirred up by a plan to develop an ancient burial ground show them what they're missing. <i>Second Glance</i> is an intricate and suspenseful ghost story that enchants and illuminates all the way to its powerful conclusion. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Jodi Picoult received an AB in creative writing from Princeton and a master&#x2019;s degree in education from Harvard.

The thrilling conclusion to the acclaimed ICEMARK trilogy!</b><br><br>Oskan and Thirrin thought their bad-seed daughter was gone for good--burnt to a cinder and cast out onto the Spirit Plain. But banishment did not kill Medea; it made her stronger. Now, allied with Cronus, embodiment of all evil, the young sorceress is plotting revenge. Thirrin is distracted by a new invader whose troops ride huge triceratops-like beasts into battle. But the warlock Oskan realizes the true threat to the kingdom is the demon army assembled by his daughter. To ensure the Icemark's eternal safety, he knows he must destroy her soul--even if it means sacrificing his own.</p><p>The Cry of the Icemark, Stuart Hill's first novel is not only a remarkable debut but also a personal tribute. When he was a teenager, Stuart lost "the real Thirrin," his red-haired sister Kathleen, to leukemia. The story of the brave young warrior-queen who faces impossible dangers is dedicated to her. The Cry of the Icemark won the Ottakars Prize for the best new children's novel, an award given by one of Britain's leading book chains. Fox 2000 Pictures will turn the story into a major motion picture and foreign rights have been sold to over 14 countries.<br><br>Among his influences Stuart counts H. Rider Haggard, J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Margaret Abbey-his former grade school teacher and a writer of historical novels. Before beginning The Cry of the Icemark, he asked himself what had grabbed his interest as a young reader. The answer? Heroes, magic, monsters, and talking beasts. From noble Snow Leopards to ancient Vampire royalty to ferocious Wolf-folk, the characters in Icemark are sure to spark the imagination of children everywhere, and Stuart is already at work on the sequel to Thirrin's epic tale.<br><br>Stuart was born in Leicester, in the East Midlands of England, where he still lives today.

Seen through this lens, familiar sayings such as "Blessed are the meek" come into vibrant contemporary focus as "Healthy are those who have softened what is rigid within."<br>In The Hidden Gospel, Douglas-Klotz employs this approach to decode the spiritual and prophetic messages hidden within key words and concepts in the sayings and stories of Jesus. We learn to our delight, for instance, that when Jesus spoke of "goodness" he used a word which in Aramaic means "ripe" and refers to actions which are in time and tune with the Sacred Unity of all life.<br><br>The Hidden Gospel aims to bridge the gap between the historical Jesus of the scholar and the Jesus of faith of Christian believers.

Aramaic was the spoken language of Jesus's day. In presenting his translations of these Early Church writings, the author discusses a mystical aspect of the Gospels that seems to harken back to the Gnostic controversy. Reading his own work in a pleasing tone, Douglas-Klotz offers not merely a lecture; approximately twenty minutes into each side an exercise is included that teaches the listener an Aramaic prayer.

But there is no moon, no stars. The only light during the regular twelve hours of "day" comes from floodlamps that cast a yellowish glow over the streets of the city.

"Besides," they tell each other, "there is nowhere but here" Among the many other things the people of Ember have forgotten is their past and a direction for their future. For 250 years they have lived pleasantly, because there has been plenty of everything in the vast storerooms. But now there are more and more empty shelves--and more and more times when the lights flicker and go out, leaving them in terrifying blackness for long minutes.

The Splendid Splinter. Teddy Ballgame. One of the greatest figures of his generation, and arguably the greatest baseball hitter of all time. But what made Ted Williams a legend &#x2013; and a lightning rod for controversy in life and in death? What motivated him to interrupt his Hall of Fame career <i>twice</i> to serve his country as a fighter pilot; to embrace his fans while tangling with the media; to retreat from the limelight whenever possible into his solitary love of fishing; and to become the most famous man ever to have his body cryogenically frozen after his death? <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Leigh Montville, who wrote the celebrated <i>Sports Illustrated</i> obituary of Ted Williams, now delivers an intimate, riveting account of this extraordinary life. <br><br>Still a gangly teenager when he stepped into a Boston Red Sox uniform in 1939, Williams&#x2019;s boisterous personality and penchant for towering home runs earned him adoring admirers--the fans--and venomous critics--the sportswriters. In 1941, the entire country followed Williams's stunning .406 season, a record that has not been touched in over six decades. At the pinnacle of his prime, Williams left Boston to train and serve as a fighter pilot in World War II, missing three full years of baseball. He was back in 1946, dominating the sport alongside teammates Dominic DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Bobby Doerr. But Williams left baseball again in 1952 to fight in Korea, where he flew thirty-nine combat missions&#x2014;crash-landing his flaming, smoke-filled plane, in one famous episode.<br><br>Ted Willams's personal life was equally colorful. His attraction to women (and their attraction to him) was a constant. He was married and divorced three times and he fathered two daughters and a son. He was one of corporate America's first modern spokesmen, and he remained, nearly into his eighties, a fiercely devoted fisherman. With his son, John Henry Williams, he devoted his final years to the sports memorabilia business, even as illness overtook him. And in death, controversy and public outcry followed Williams and the disagreements between his children over the decision to have his body preserved for future resuscitation in a cryonics facility--a fate, many argue, Williams never wanted. <br><br>With unmatched verve and passion, and drawing upon hundreds of interviews, acclaimed best-selling author Leigh Montville brings to life Ted Williams's superb triumphs, lonely tragedies, and intensely colorful personality, in a biography that is fitting of an American hero and legend.</p></p><p>Leigh Montville's <i>Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero</i> is the definitive biography that baseball fans have been waiting for. Montville, who was a sports columnist for the <i>Boston Globe</i> and then a senior writer for <i>Sports Illustrated</i> is an admitted Red Sox and Williams fanatic, and his passion for his hero rings clearly from every page, along with his clear baseball expertise. But Montville does not hide Williams's flaws. The young Williams was temperamental and justified bad behavior with batting prowess that could excuse just about anything. Quick to anger, "the Kid" had a gift for foul language, too. <p> Montville's study offers insides accounts of Williams's obsessive development as a hitter and his constant struggle to perfect his swing (mistakenly called "natural" by sports writers with little understanding of his extensive preparation). The chapter on 1941, perhaps the greatest year in his career, draws on research and interviews never before published. Montville lets whole passages stand uninterrupted--from Williams's manager, Joe Cronin, from his teammate Dom DiMaggio, and from other players and baseball officials who tell the story of Williams's quest for a .400 batting average. The tale of the final day of the season (when he refused to be benched and went six for eight in a double header to jump from .39955 to his final total, .406) is as pulse-pounding as any thriller. </p><p> Alongside its essential focus on Williams's baseball life, the book also delves into his military service during both World War II and the Korean War, his passion for sports fishing, and his commitment to helping children through the Jimmy Fund. Finally, Montville devotes a chapter to the controversy after Williams's death, exposing the back-and-forth among Williams's heirs in the bizarre decision to freeze his body in a cryogenic warehouse in Scottsdale, Arizona. </p><p> Montville's biography makes a good case that Williams was, if not the greatest hitter ever to play the game, certainly among them. For his focused, scientific approach to hitting, Williams is unmatched in the history of the game. His life, marred perhaps by a temper and occasional immaturity that soured his reputation in Boston, is one of true sports greatness. Early in the book, Montville argues that Williams is less appreciated today than he might be because he played out most of his 19-year career in the era before televised highlights. But with Montville's efforts to capture first-hand accounts of Williams's achievements, The Splendid Splinter's legacy is assured. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p>Leigh Montville, former sports columnist at the <i>Boston Globe</i> and former senior writer at <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, is the author of the best-selling <i>At The Altar of Speed: The Fast Life and Tragic Death of Dale Earnhardt</i>.

Soon he is on the journey of a lifetime, his eyes open to awe-inspring new places and people, his days filled with fresh adventure. But chaos and betrayal plague him at every turn, and nothing is what it seems.

The story is solidly in the tradition (some might say derivative) of the classic heroic quest fantasy, with the predictable cast of dwarves, elves, and dragons--but also including some imaginatively creepy creatures of evil.<p> The land of Alagaesia is suffering under the Empire of the wicked Galbatorix, and Eragon and his dragon Saphira, last of the Riders, are the only hope. But Eragon is young and has much to learn, and so he is sent off to the elven forest city of Ellesmera, where he and Saphira are tutored in magic, battle skills, and the ancient language by the wise former Rider Oromis and his elderly dragon Glaedr. Meanwhile, back at Carvahall, Eragon's home, his cousin Roran is the target of a siege by the hideous Ra'zac, and he must lead the villagers on a desperate escape over the mountains. The two narratives move toward a massive battle with the forces of Galbatorix, where Eragon learns a shocking secret about his parentage and commits himself to saving his people.</p><p> The sheer size of the novel, as well as its many characters, places with difficult names, and its use of imaginary languages make this a challenging read, even for experienced fantasy readers. It is essential to have the plot threads of the first volume well in mind before beginning--the publisher has provided not only a map, but a helpful synopsis of the first book and a much-needed Language Guide. But no obstacles will deter the many fans of Eragon from diving headfirst into this highly-awaited fantasy.

If you&#39;re a cop in Hollywood Division, it also means dealing with the most overwrought, desperate, and deluded criminals anywhere. When you&#39;re patrolling Sunset and Hollywood Boulevards, neither a good reputation nor the lessons of scandals past will help you keep your cool, your sanity, or your life when things heat up.The robbery of a Hollywood jewelry store, complete with masks and a hand grenade, quickly connects to a Russian nightclub, an undercover operation gone bloodily wrong, and a cluelessly ambitious pair of tweakers. Putting the pieces together are the sergeant they call the Oracle and his squad of street cops. There&#39;s Budgie Polk, a twenty-something firecracker with a four-month-old at home, and Wesley Drubb, a rich boy who joined the force seeking thrills. Fausto Gamboa is the tetchy veteran, and Hollywood Nate is the one who never shuts up about movies. They spend their days in patrol cars and their nights in the underbelly of a city that never sleeps. From their headquarters at Hollywood Station, they see the glamour city for what it is: a field of land mines, where the mundane is dangerous and the dangerous is mundane.</p><p>Joseph Wambaugh, a former LAPD detective sergeant, is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of sixteen previous works of fiction and nonfiction, including The Choirboys and The Onion Field.

A suspenseful and always surprising romp through 1911 Egypt with Amelia and her equally indomitable family, the Emersons, <i>The Falcon at the Portal</i> immerses us in a fascinating world of antiquity and majesty, and plunges us into a mystery as perilous as it is puzzling. As the <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> suggests, let us all &#x201c;raise a toast to the incomparable Amelia Peabody.&#x201d;</p></p><p>"'Really,' I thought in mounting exasperation, 'there never was a household in which so many people felt free to offer their unsolicited opinions!'" This, of course, is the eminent Egyptologist and dedicated crime solver Amelia Peabody, setting the stage and the tone (an updated Oscar Wildean irony) for Elizabeth Peters's 11th book. And it's true that there are no shrinking violets in this particular household, from the redoubtable Amelia and her hot-tempered archaeologist husband Emerson (his native diggers call him the Father of Curses), to their dashing, unpredictable son Ramses (born Walter). Also, let's not forget their lovely ward, Nefret (rescued from a desert tribe several books back), and their butler, Gargery, "who wields a cudgel as handily as he carves a roast." <p> As she has so many times before, Peters presents us with this quaint--even campy--little group of people, plops them down in an exotic Egyptian setting, and then surprises us by involving them in a story of great strength and emotion. </p><p> It's 1911, and David Todros, a young Egyptian who has just married into the Peabody family, is suspected of dealing in forged antiquities, possibly to help support a rising nationalist movement. Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, and Nefret all take various actions to help David, and there are serious, dangerous consequences for everyone involved. Despite the melodramatic setting and the theatrical language, Peters's story is--as always--modern, believable, and exciting.</p><p> Other books in the Peabody series available in paperback are <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i>, <i>The Crocodile on the Sandbank</i>, <i>The Curse of the Pharaohs</i>, and <i>The Hippopotamus Pool</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p><p>As the 1911 archaeological season begins, Amelia and famille have arrived in Egypt for their annual excavation. While the reappearance of Ramses' dreadful cousin Percy is to be lamented, the marriage of his best friend David to Amelia's niece Lia is a source of joy for everyone. But the bride has barely walked down the aisle before trouble begins stalking the family. First, David is accused of selling ancient Egyptian artifacts that are actually hight-priced, almost undetectable fakes. Then, though this year's site appears ordinary ebough-dull, really-some deadly surprises await the professional touch of Professor Radcliffe Emerson, the Father of Curses, holder of innumberable honorary degrees, scourge of the underworld, and the greatest Egyptologist of this or any other age.</p><p>But even as Amelia and company endeavor to clear David's name and expose the real culprit, worse crimes and surfacing. the first is the body of an American at the bottom of the Emersons' excavation shaft. Then, as accusations of drug-dealing and moral misconduct start flying, the appearance of a small child of mysterious antecendents sparks a crisis that threatens to tear the Emerson family apart.

But one day the wind screams fiercely and the sun does not rise over the mountain. Someone has stolen the sun! "Perhaps it has lost its way," says Lucia, who despite her mother's pleas sets out to find it with only a bit of bread, a tinderbox, and her milk-white cat to keep her company. In dramatic pastels, Mary GrandPr� illuminates troll-pocked frozen mountains and wraps Lucia's family in a blanket of warmth. Inspired by Nordic lore, Phyllis Root spins a golden yarn of courage, love, and the age-old longing for the return of light.</p><p>Phyllis Root has written more than thirty books for children, including WHAT BABY WANTS, OLIVER FINDS HIS WAY, KISS THE COW!, and BIG MOMMA MAKES THE WORLD, winner of a BOSTON GLOBE-HORN BOOK Award.

She lives in Sarasota, Florida.*Starred Review* Lucia has always loved the cozy mountain cabin that she shares with her mother, baby brother, a cow, and a milk-white cat. Then comes a winter when the sun disappears altogether. Mama is loving and reassuring: "We will be each other's sun until the real sun returns." But brave Lucia is determined to restore daylight, and with her cat tucked into her parka, she sets off on her skis. Grandpre's evocative, dimly lit acrylics capture the eerie mystery and shivery suspense of the adventure, as Lucia treks through spooky, starlit forests and finally finds the sun, held hostage by a band of deliciously gruesome trolls. Root's rich language and well-paced story are sure to capture a young crowd of eager listeners, and children will connect with the messages about friendship and cooperation; as intrepid as Lucia is, she still needs the help of her white cat to carry out her quest and return safely home. A final note extends the story's <i>pourquoi</i>-tale elements by suggesting that Lucia's battle is an annual event: each winter, the days will only lengthen after a courageous person has battled the trolls and reclaimed the sun. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He's the guy who has been down so long it looks like up. <br><br>Richard George Fari�a (March 8, 1937 - April 30, 1966) was an American writer and folksinger. He was a figure in both the counterculture scene of the early- to mid-sixties and the budding folk rock scene of the same era.</p><p>This is the ultimate novel of college life during the first hallucinatory flowering of what has famously come to be known as The Sixties. <i>Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me</i> follows haunted ur-hippy Gnossos Pappadopoulis upon return to his old university town that's just tilting into a new era, and Gnossos' involvement in a swirl of sixties-style drug taking and the search for love and the meaning of it all. It is a hilarious and haunting book.<b>Richard Fari�a</b> was killed in a motorcycle accident in Carmel, California, on April 30, 1966-two days after the publication of Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me. A posthumous collection of his writings, Long Time Coming and a Long Time Gone, was published in 1969. <br><br><b> Thomas Pynchon</b> was born in Glen Cove, New York, in 1937.

It remains, five years later, in its original hardcover edition. It was the book by the Dalai Lama that broke new ground, that made him accessible to a larger audience, spreading his words of daily wisdom and message of inner peace that captured the imagination of America. His Holiness the Dalai Lama, for the first time since that revolutionary book, has once again teamed up with psychiatrist Howard Cutler to resume the discussion about what makes life meaningful begun in <i>The Art of Happiness</i>.<br><br>Over the past several years, Howard Cutler has continued his conversations with the Dalai Lama, asking him the questions we all want answered about how to find happiness in the place we spend most of our time. Work-whether it's in the home or at an office-is what mostly runs our lives. We depend on it to eat, to clothe and shelter ourselves, and to take care of our families. Once again, Dr. Cutler brings forward seminal studies and asks the Dalai Lama to respond. Beginning with a direct correlation between productivity and happiness, Dr. Cutler questions His Holiness about the nature of work. In psychiatry and according to the Dalai Lama, our motivation for working determines our level of satisfaction. The book explores these three levels of focus:<br><br><b>Survival</b>: focus on salary, stability, food and clothing<br><b>Career</b>: focus on advancement<br><b>Calling</b>: focus on work as a higher purpose<br><br>Cutler probes the Dalai Lama's wisdom by posing these questions: How does the relationship between our personal values and those of our employers affect happiness? What is the relationship between self-awareness and work? What are the main sources of dissatisfaction and how can we cope with them? How do we deal with conflicts with coworkers and bosses? How do we deal with jealousy, anger, or hostility at work? How does the lack of freedom affect our levels of happiness? How do we deal with boredom or lack of challenge? Unfair criticism? Overly demanding or taxing situations? Job change and unemployment?<br><br>Once again, Cutler walks us through the Dalai Lama's reasoning so that we know how to apply the wisdom to daily life. This practical application of Buddhist ideas&nbsp;is an invaluable source of strength and peace for anyone who earns a living.&nbsp;<br><br>The Dalai Lama's most recent book, <i>The Wisdom of Compassion</i>, is now available from Riverhead Books.</p><p>In their 1998 book <i>The Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Living</i>, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and co-author Howard C. Cutler, M.D., explored how inner development contributes to overall happiness. In their second collaboration, the authors considered how they could best follow their highly successful first book. They chose a subject that affects millions of people around the world and produced. In this very readable, useful book, the authors attempt to discover the following: "Where does work fit in to our overall quest for happiness?" and "To what degree does work satisfaction affect our overall life satisfaction and happiness?" <i>The Art of Happiness at Work</i> is a modern-day Socratic dialogue in which Cutler asks the Dalai Lama about the difficulties and rewards we might encounter in the workplace. The authors explore issues such as work and identity, making money, the Buddhist concept of "right livelihood," and transforming dissatisfaction at work. The discussion appears simple, if not obvious, at first, but upon closer scrutiny, the Dalai Lama's profound wisdom and sensitivity emerges. For the Dalai Lama, basic human values such as kindness, tolerance, compassion, honesty, and forgiveness are the source of human happiness. Throughout the book, he illustrates with clear examples how bringing those qualities to bear on work-related challenges can help us tolerate or overcome the most thorny situations. Recognizing that not all problems can be solved, the Dalai Lama provides very sound advice. The authors urge balance and self-awareness and wisely state, "No matter how satisfying our work is, it is a mistake to rely on work as our only source of satisfaction." --<i>Silvana Tropea</i>Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, is the spiritual and temporal leader of the Tibetan people. His tireless efforts on behalf of human rights and world peace have brought him international recognition. He is the recipient of the Wallenberg Award (conferred by the U.S. Congressional Human Rights Foundation), the Albert Schweitzer Award, and the Nobel Peace Prize.<br>Howard C. Cutler, M.D., is a diplomat of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. He first met the Dalai Lama in 1982 while visiting India on a research grant to study Tibetan medicine.

It is &#34;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&#34;, first published in 1961, and it&#39;s a book that is a statement, not of culinary intent, but of aspiration, a commitment to a certain sort of good life, a certain sort of world-view; a votive object implying taste and appetite and a little je ne sais quoi. Julia Child was like Amelia Earhart, or Eleanor Roosevelt: she was a hero who&#39;d gone out there and made a difference. Her books are a triumph, and also a trophy&#39; - A.A. Gill, &#34;The Times&#34;.</p><p>This is the classic cookbook, in its entirety&#x2014;all 524 recipes. <br><br>&#x201c;Anyone can cook in the French manner anywhere,&#x201d; wrote Mesdames Beck, Bertholle, and Child, &#x201c;with the right instruction.&#x201d; And here is the book that, for more than forty years, has been teaching Americans how. <br><br><em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> is for both seasoned cooks and beginners who love good food and long to reproduce at home the savory delights of the classic cuisine, from the historic Gallic masterpieces to the seemingly artless perfection of a dish of spring-green peas. This beautiful book, with more than 100 instructive illustrations, is revolutionary in its approach because: <br><br>� it leads the cook infallibly from the buying and handling of raw ingredients, through each essential step of a recipe, to the final creation of a delicate confection; <br><br>� it breaks down the classic cuisine into a logical sequence of themes and variations rather than presenting an endless and diffuse catalogue of recipes; the focus is on key recipes that form the backbone of French cookery and lend themselves to an infinite number of elaborations&#x2014;bound to increase anyone&#x2019;s culinary repertoire; <br><br>� it adapts classical techniques, wherever possible, to modern American conveniences; <br><br>� it shows Americans how to buy products, from any supermarket in the United States, that reproduce the exact taste and texture of the French ingredients, for example, equivalent meat cuts, the right beans for a cassoulet, or the appropriate fish and seafood for a bouillabaisse; <br><br>� it offers suggestions for just the right accompaniment to each dish, including proper wines. Since there has never been a book as instructive and as workable as <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em>, the techniques learned here can be applied to recipes in all other French cookbooks, making them infinitely more usable. In compiling the secrets of famous cordons bleus, the authors have produced a magnificent volume that is sure to find the place of honor in every kitchen in America. Bon app�tit! <em><br><br>Julie &amp; Julia</em> is now a major motion picture (releasing in August 2009) starring Meryl Streep as Julia Child.

A popular Coast to Coast radio host (and Episcopal clergy) provides some answers. In a first of its kind book, Ian Punnett provides a spiritual path for expressing your rawest emotions through prayer and how to rebuild a relationship with one's higher power--or anybody else in your life.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this important and practical book, Ian Punnett provides insight on&nbsp;&nbsp; feeling anger and resentment toward God and offers advice on how to deal with the pain and blame that accompanies these emotions. In a book that is edgy, timely, funny and compassionate, Punnett presents real help in everyday language for transforming the negativity of anger into a positive and useful force that will ultimately help us pray more effectively, bring us closer to God, enhance our spiritual relationship, and change the way we live and love others.<br>&nbsp;<br>After a divorce, a broken friendship, the death of a loved one, the loss of a job or even the accumulation of all the tiny cracks in our spirit from life's disappointments, it&#x2019;s easy to feel pissed at God. When anger is left unchecked, it is harmful to &nbsp;our minds, bodies and souls.<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;How to Pray When You&#x2019;re Pissed at God is not &#x201c;the last word&#x201d; on angry prayer,&#x201d; Punnett writes, &#x201c;but it might be the first words you have ever heard on the topic. By the end of the book, it is my hope that you&#x2019;ll understand the role of anger in our lives, the benefit of honest prayer, and the need for honest, angry prayer in the lives of the faithful and faithless.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>IAN PUNNETT</b> is one of the hosts of <i>Coast to Coast AM</i>, a legendary radio show syndicated on almost 600 stations across North America and a deacon in The Episcopal Church who received his Masters of Divinity degree from Columbia Theological Seminary in Atlanta.</p>Chapter One<br><br>Is It Okay to Be Mad at God?<br><br>On a Sunday in November 2010, Buffalo Bills wide receiver Steve Johnson was so angry after having bobbled what would have been a winning touchdown against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers that he tweeted this to his many thousands of followers: &#x201c;I praise you 24/7!!! And this is how you do me!!! You expect me to learn from this!! How?? I&#x2019;ll never forget this!! Ever!! Thx tho!&#x201d;<br><br>No word on whether God actually follows Steve Johnson on Twitter, but apparently a lot of God&#x2019;s followers do.<br><br>After his digital outburst, Johnson received a barrage of criticism not only from Bills fans but also from sports talk show hosts and callers from around the country. One guy who posts comments online under the name &#x201c;A Bit Concerned&#x201d; reflected the backlash when he wrote, &#x201c;Steve should start attending Sunday school or Bible study more often to get better acquainted with GOD. Or perhaps even a hearty chat with the Bills&#x2019; chaplain will help him cope better. More importantly it is time to grow up and own his mistakes.&#x201d; Receiving little support, Johnson retreated days later and responded to the criticism with a new tweet: &#x201c;No, I did not blame God, people. Seriously?&#x201d;<br><br>Too bad. Steve Johnson should not have backed down. Before he buckled under the pressure from those too nervous or too timid to express anger and frustration toward God, Johnson was in the company of angels.<br><br>The Bible is full of heroes who took their relationship with God seriously enough to honor their Creator with honesty. In fact, anger between the Creator and creation is older than the Bible itself. For example, years before the Bible was even written down, Moses and God quarreled after the children of Israel got drunk and bowed down to a graven image of another god. After all God had done to free the Israelites from bondage in Egypt, his people wanted to replace him with a golden calf. God was as angry as someone who has just come home from a hard day at work and catches their spouse cheating in the marital bed. God declared to Moses that this was the last straw, and that, as God, God was going start again with humanity. A lesser prophet might have stepped aside and let the Creator wipe out creation, but Moses had the chutzpah to challenge God on whether or not God&#x2019;s reaction was fair. God backed down.<br><br>Now, you might be saying, Moses&#x2019;s cause seems more righteous than a dropped football pass--and you&#x2019;d be right (unless you&#x2019;re a Buffalo Bills fan). But the lesson is the same: God can handle the occasional angry outburst. God can handle being questioned.<br><br>The biblical story of a righteous man named Job is another example of somebody who stands up to God and lives to tell about it. In the not-so-surprisingly titled book of Job, God and Satan treat our protagonist like a lab rat. Why? To determine whether a prosperous, faithful man would curse God if everything he loves is taken away. So, long Bible story short, God allows Satan to wipe out Job&#x2019;s fortune, kill Job&#x2019;s seven sons and three daughters, and then cover his body in boils. Job feels that God was unjustified in making a good man suffer, and he tells God exactly how he feels--despite tremendous pressure from his friends to keep his mouth shut. Job&#x2019;s wife, on the other hand, has another thought. She suggests he &#x201c;curse God and die.&#x201d; Job does neither. Instead of cursing God, he calls God out on the series of tragedies he has suffered and he demands answers.<br><br>Let the battle begin! Job jabs with &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; God counters that &#x201c;God is God,&#x201d; and God could crush Job&#x2019;s head like a grape if God felt like it--an argument Job has a hard time refuting. Yet after a few rounds Job wins the match (arguably) because he is not punished for questioning God as his friends had feared he would be. In a surprise ending, instead God sides with Job and rebukes Job&#x2019;s friends for being such candy asses (I&#x2019;m paraphrasing here). Subsequently, Job&#x2019;s suffering is turned into a blessing--he ends up with even more stuff than he had before, including seven new sons and three new daughters (the Bible even makes the rather tacky point that the new living daughters are better looking than the old dead ones--yikes). Job lives another 140 years boil-free. The Bible doesn&#x2019;t concern itself with how Mrs. Job feels about God. Just sayin&#x2019;.<br><br>So what&#x2019;s the moral here? Well, there are many, but one is that God wants us to speak our truth when we are experiencing disappointment, resentment, and anger and that it&#x2019;s perfectly fine to express our beliefs in times of crisis. In the end we have to get good with what God has planned for us, but we do not have to go quietly. Quick side note: The theme of &#x201c;I will not go quietly&#x201d; is powerfully represented in the movie The Apostle, written by, directed by, produced by, and starring Robert Duvall. In a pivotal scene, a charismatic, slightly psychotic Pentecostal preacher argues so loudly in prayer with God that he wakes the neighborhood. The preacher&#x2019;s mother, played by June Carter Cash, answers a complaining call from an angry neighbor by saying, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my son, that is. I&#x2019;ll tell ya, ever since he was an itty-bitty boy, sometimes he talks to the Lord and sometimes he yells at the Lord. Tonight, he just happens to be yellin&#x2019; at him.&#x201d;<br><br>Even Jesus of Nazareth--hands-down the most obedient son who ever lived (&#x201c;Wait, you want me to find twelve friends who are willing to die, perform lots of miracles, pick a fight with the local officials, and then get myself nailed to a tree? Sure, Dad.&#x201d;)--does not go quietly either. Crucified, bloodied, and thirsty he cries out in agony quoting the first line from Psalm 22: &#x201c;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&#x201d; It is one of the saddest, most desperate prayers in a Bible full of pain, frustration, and anger.<br><br>In fact, prayers of the pissed off are everywhere in the Bible, so this is probably a good time to talk specifically about the Book of Psalms, a collection of 150 Hebrew songs and prayers that are some of the best-loved spiritual writings of all time and a source of inspiration for billions of members of different faiths around the world. Commonly the psalms are broken up into five or six main &#x201c;themes,&#x201d; including but not limited to psalms of praise, psalms of thanksgiving, royal psalms, psalms for special occasions, so-called &#x201c;curse psalms,&#x201d; and psalms of lament.<br><br>Most of these categories are self-explanatory, but two need more illumination because they interconnect. Let&#x2019;s look briefly at the curse psalms and the psalms of lament.<br><br>Curse psalms are dominated by expressions of anger and frustration, and are characterized by grievances directed at others and at God, sentiments that can get really ugly. The general consensus among scholars is that Psalms 5, 6, 11, 12, 35, 37, 40, 52, 54, 56, 58, 69, 79, 83, 109, 137, 139, and 143 are grouped together as curse psalms, while other psalms have curse elements to them. Lament, on the other hand, is a tricky word in relation to these prayers because lament means &#x201c;an expression of sorrow or grief.&#x201d; The problem, then, is that there is a difference between saying, &#x201c;I am sad, God,&#x201d; and saying, &#x201c;God, this really sucks that I am so sad, and you really could be doing something about it, God, but you&#x2019;re not.&#x201d; Lament psalms are often laced with anger toward and resentment of God. For example, Psalm 5 doesn&#x2019;t just lament God&#x2019;s seeming unwillingness to strike out against the enemies of the person who is praying; it tactfully (more or less) schools God on how God should be dealing with what the writer perceives as bad people:<br>For there is no truth in their mouths;<br><br>their hearts are destruction;<br><br>their throats are open graves;<br><br>they flatter with their tongues.<br><br>Make them bear their guilt, O God;<br><br>let them fall by their own counsels;<br><br>because of their many transgressions cast them out,<br><br>for they have rebelled against you.<br>Suffice it to say there are many such prayers for the pissed off in the Bible, demonstrating that there is a long history of praying in anger to God and at God. There&#x2019;s also a long history of skittish theologians trying to contextualize those angry prayers in order to &#x201c;take the curse off them.&#x201d; Case in point, Dr. Ralph F. Wilson, director of Joyful Heart Renewal Ministries and author of Experiencing the Psalms, argues in his writing that the angriest psalms are an example of &#x201c;pre-Christian attitudes&#x201d; and are &#x201c;not to be examples of our lives as Christians.&#x201d; Not surprisingly, I disagree and find that attitude intellectually dishonest and unproductive. First of all, if we follow Wilson&#x2019;s Christian logic, anything in the Old Testament could reflect a &#x201c;pre-Christian attitude,&#x201d; so all the psalms, the writings of the prophets, and even the Ten Commandments could be ignored. But doesn&#x2019;t common sense dictate that we should expect psalms that reflect anger toward God if anger is a natural emotion experienced by everyone from young children to sports heroes to saints?<br><br>Dr. Julie Exline, professor of clinical psychology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, explained another aspect of the debate about angry prayer in an e-mail: &#x201c;A national survey included an item on anger toward God back in 1988 and revealed that about two thirds of Americans admitted that they were sometimes angry at God.&#x201d; But Exline&#x2019;s recent research into &#x201c;God focused anger&#x201d; indicates that &#x201c;there is some reason to believe that these estimates are on the low side. For example, people who see anger toward God as morally wrong say that they would be less comfortable admitting these feelings to others (including researchers).&#x201d;<br><br>Even in the comfort of prosperity, some people find it difficult to maintain a relationship with the Divine. In maddening times, as in the events of war, natural disasters, famine, and family crisis, faith can be so problematic that prayers can be a lot less &#x201c;Holy Bible&#x201d; and a lot more &#x201c;Holy $h#!&#x201d;<br><br>If you have ever found yourself so angry at God that you have lost the ability to pray, you may have been standing on the threshold of a new level of faith (although it might have felt more like a breakdown than a breakthrough at the time). Oftentimes in our human relationships, the tighter the relationship, the tighter the tension, and it&#x2019;s no different with God.<br><br>I can speak from experience. My breakdown/breakthrough came at the tail end of my high school graduation and continued through my first year of college. During that period an older man from my church who had been like a father to me was fighting for his life in a hospital. Because my real father lacked the emotional resources necessary to be a fully dimensional dad, this neighbor had been a very important and beneficial influence in my life as I was growing up. He was my role model. And this great man was now on the verge of death at such a relatively young age? He was married, could be such a great father--how could God do that? In a just universe, why would God do that?<br><br>I was angry so I prayed. I begged God to allow me to switch places with him. If there were a magical cliff from which I could have thrown myself, and my death would have meant that he could have been restored, I would have jumped without hesitation. But as things got worse for him and my prayers became more desperate, I began to lose my faith that there was any point to trying to be righteous at all.<br><br>The breaking point came when in the depth of my anger I became what is called a &#x201c;protest atheist.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s not that I stopped believing in God; rather I had stopped believing in a God who was worthy of being worshipped. Every day I simply did what I wanted regardless of whether it was consistent with my family&#x2019;s values. I stopped paying any real attention to my studies. I even lost my virginity to a registered nurse I barely knew on the hood of her Corvette under a full moon just to make sure God would notice.<br><br>And yet, from appearances anyway, my life kept getting better. To paraphrase from the book of Job, I cursed God but I did not die. I was offered jobs, raises, parts in college performances for which I didn&#x2019;t even have to audition. I had stopped going to church, I had stopped reading the Bible, and I had stopped praying, but nothing bad happened. In my religious worldview leading up to college, this kind of cause and effect would not have made sense at all.<br><br>At some point I realized that I still yearned for my relationship with God. While there was a slim hope for this man who had been like a father to me, though, there didn&#x2019;t seem to be any hope for me and the Lord. As it turned out, my mentor indeed did survive, albeit with lasting damage to his body. For a period of time after that, however, I didn&#x2019;t have faith; I had an empty box where my faith used to be.<br><br>Eventually, feeling as though I was hurting myself more than God, I became nostalgic for my robust prayer life. My first tentative prayers to God were in selfish gratitude for having this man back in my life. Before long I was back to praying for guidance and direction, solace, repentance, and a sense of connection to something larger than myself. While I have never fully reconciled with God for the pain and sorrow that my friend was put through (and probably never will), in other ways my connection with the Divine has never been deeper, more productive, or more dependable.<br>God and I still have our moments, but I know that I am not alone in that. Many of us have been, are now, or will be, at some point, pissed at God. The reasons will vary: feelings of abandonment; the loss of a child, a spouse, or a mother or father; financial setbacks, the stock market crashing, or somebody looting your 401K plan; loneliness or natural disasters that wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent bystanders; or lost opportunities (like Steve Johnson dropping a winning touchdown pass). Sometimes these feelings work themselves out on their own, but when our resentment toward God festers--which it often does when it goes unexpressed--that resentment can lead us to shut down a part of our souls. Without a spiritual road map back to the emotional Promised Land of peace and prosperity in faith, many people lose their relationship with God simply because they feel as though they do not have a right to quarrel, to demand answers, or to question, &#x201c;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&#x201d;</p><h2>Harris&#39;s List of Covent Garden Ladies: Sex in the City in Georgian Britain</h2><p><p><i>Harris&#x2019;s List of Covent Garden Ladies</i> was a bestseller of the 18th century, selling 250,000 copies in an age before mass consumerism.

The trout are large but wary, and each day represents an opportunity for Lyons to learn more about fly-fishing, the natural world, and himself. <i>Spring Creek</i> is an eloquent meditation on one man's pursuit of his passion.If, as Norman MacLean claims in A River Runs Through It , the apostle John was a dry fly fisherman, surely wild spring creeks are the flyfisher's sanctum sanctorum. In these 12 personal essays, Lyons declares himself a true believer, practicing his faith on the clear, wild waters of Spring Creek in central Montana. After a hilarious mishap in which he hooks and lands a water snake, Lyons next observes, "the wind and rain were quite fierce now but I noticed, in the pond above the Two Islands Pol, about a half dozen absolutely huge fish prowling . . . . " Those who have not flyfished such streams will find Lyons's account of his experiences the best substitute. The author of The Seasonable Angler and Bright Rivers knows full well that some of the best fishing moments occur while waiting out a rain shower and afterwards at dinner.

A detailed description of each fabric is illustrated with a real cloth example, right there on the same page, which clarifies in the simplest way what a silk shantung, cotton seersucker or boiled wool actually looks and feels like. <p>All About Silk is the first volume in the series. A brief introduction covers the history of silk, the main sources of silk and the silk textile industry, followed by descriptions and samples of 32 silk fabrics, in alphabetical order: batiste de soie, broadcloth, brocade, charmeuse, chiffon, China silk, cloque, crepe, crepe de Chine, douppioni, four-ply silk, gabardine, georgette, habutai, jacquard, knit, matelasse, matka, noil, organza, peau de soie, pongee, printed silk, sandwashed silk, shantung, suiting, surah, taffeta, Thai silk, tussah silk, tweed, velvet. </p><p>All About Silk is packed with information about the different weaves, yarns and finishes used to make silk fabrics. Terms such as cultivated silk, wild silk, raw silk and spun silk are clearly explained. The author uses simple drawings, an easy-to-read, consistent format and clear uncomplicated language. </p><p>Other books in the series include All About Cotton, with 40 cotton samples, and All About Wool, with 35 wool samples.</p></p><p>Julie Parker is a former newspaper editor turned fabric junkie. She holds a bachelor of arts degree in communications from the University of Washington in Seattle and a second bachelor&#39;s degree in apparel design from Western Washington University in Bellingham. She was a newspaper editor for 10 years before returning to school to study clothing design. She is the author of three books and recently was hired by the Wool Bureau in New York to write a guide to wool fabrics that was distributed to members of the garment industry throughout North America. Her most recent book, All About Wool, was a finalist in the crafts category of the 1997 Small Press Book Awards. She lives in Seattle.I wrote this book because I wanted to know what I was looking at when I went to the fabric store. I have been sewing for more than 20 years, but until recently, fabric made no more sense to me than it did when I made my first dress back in the sixth grade. <p>A trip to the fabric store was inspiring and confusing. Colors and textures caught my eye, but I knew little about the different types of fabrics and their characteristics. </p><p>I was familiar with terms like twill, tissue faille and crepe, but I didn't know what they meant. I didn't understand the distinction between crepe chiffon and chiffon taffeta. I thought organdy and organza were the same thing. I thought damask and jacquard were different. </p><p>When I began to ask questions, I didn't get satisfactory answers. I got more confused. And I discovered that many other people who work with fabric don't know any more about it than I did. </p><p>I consulted sewing and textile books, and quickly discovered that some fabrics have three or four names, some terms describe three or four fabrics, and some terms have three or four spellings. It's normal to be confused. </p><p>I was overwhelmed by vague and conflicting descriptions and industry jargon. Textile dictionaries are quite technical: They speak of picks and ends, bilateral fibers, warp beams, eight-harness looms, weft yarns, calendering, gassing, singeing and face-finished goods. </p><p>None of that makes much sense to me. What I want to know is how each fabric looks, feels and behaves, how to use it and how to care for it. I want to know how much I can expect to pay for it and where to buy it. When I pay $30 a yard for three yards of silk, I want to make that purchase with confidence in my ability to choose the right fabric for my project. </p><p>Those who lack confidence in their fabric-selecting skills are advised to stick to the list of fabrics suggested on the back of most pattern envelopes. This is not as easy as it sounds, for two reasons: </p><p>The lists usually include confusing, oversimplified or vague terminology. </p><p>Even when the information is clear, it is not very useful, because fabric stores seldom use such terms to label their products. </p><p>Most fabric labels include the fiber content, the price and, in many cases, a recommended method of care. Some stores routinely provide additional information about the weave, the country of origin, the fabric's weight and so forth, while others make no effort to do so. </p><p>This is not a conspiracy to keep customers in the dark. Many stores do not identify fabric types because they simply don't know what they are. </p><p>For starters, only a few fabric types can be easily identified and accurately labeled. Descriptions of similar types of fabrics often overlap; distinctions are not clear and usually represent someone's preference or opinion rather than fact. You might call a fabric "damask," while I prefer to call it "jacquard." We would both be right. </p><p>That's because there are no hard and fast rules about defining fabric. The textile industry is creative and competitive, driven by consumer demands for fashion and function. Weaves, fibers, dyes and finishes can be mixed together in a mind-boggling number of combinations. As fabrics evolve, definitions change. </p><p>Adding to the confusion is the natural desire of textile mills and garment manufacturers to market their products by suggesting an air of distinction, novelty or exclusivity. The easiest way to do this is to give the product a catchy name. And almost anything goes, as long as the manufacturer gives equal time to the fabric's fiber content. </p><p>The catchy name may refer to the fiber, the weave, the finish or the garment itself, resulting in a jumble of confusing terms. A number of very different items often wind up bearing similar names, even when they have nothing in common. </p><p>The confusion is compounded when an item becomes popular enough to receive media attention. Constant use of a catchy marketing term often creates the impression that the name refers to a standard type of fabric with clearly defined characteristics, when it does not. </p><p>Finally, some fabrics don't have assigned names. Mills frequently use numbers, rather than names, because it is easier to keep track of fabric No. 3754 than "lightweight silk crepe with jacquard figures." When one of these numbered fabrics is described in terms of fabric types, it is based on the expertise and opinion of the person giving the description, rather than an industry standard for the fabric. </p><p>In spite of this, some fabrics are easily defined. It's not difficult at all to conjure up an image of corduroy, velvet, denim or canvas. Most people can visualize a terry cloth bathrobe and an oxford shirt. </p><p>These are what the textile industry calls staple fabrics. Staple fabrics have steady sales over an extended period of time. They are produced in response to a large and continuous demand, they have been around for years and they aren't going to disappear in the near future. </p><p>Novelty fabrics are variations of staple fabrics. They usually resemble certain fabrics, even if they aren't exactly the same. So while it is next to impossible to accurately define all fabrics, it is easy to describe staple fabrics and to apply that knowledge to everything else. That's where this book fits in.</p></p><h2>The Reality Dysfunction: Emergence &amp; Expansion</h2><p>Densely packed with detailed world-building, a host of convincing characters, a jet-propelled pace and an intricately coiled, multifaceted plot, THE REALITY DYSFUNCTION is a towering achievement---science fiction with a wallop. Project your mind into the 27th century. Humanity is split between Adamists, &#34;normals&#34;, who faithfully retain their God-given biological heritage, and Edenists, humans telepathically gene-linked to their sentient, bio-engineered spaceships and habitats. Far out in space, one of these custom-grown &#34;biteks&#34; orbits above the greatest scientific mystery ever known: the Ruin Ring, a halo of debris composed entirely of alien habitats pulverized 2,500 years ago. What could have caused such destruction? A data chip from this long-extinct race, the Laymil, holds the only clue to the phenomenon---a force beyond human comprehension, a horror that mocks both science and faith. The Laymil called it &#34;the Reality Dysfunction&#34;--a rip in the fabric of spacetime. But to the worlds trapped in its path, they might as well have called it Hell.</p><p></p><h2>Summer and Smoke. (Acting Edition for Theater Productions)</h2><p>"Summer and Smoke" is a two-part, thirteen-scene play by Tennessee Williams, originally titled Chart of Anatomy when Williams began work on it in 1945. In 1964, Williams revised the play as "The Eccentricities of a Nightingale." "Summer and Smoke" is set in Glorious Hill, Mississippi from the "turn of the century through 1916," and centers on a high-strung, unmarried minister's daughter, Alma Winemiller, and the spiritual/sexual romance that nearly blossoms between her and the wild, undisciplined young doctor who grew up next door, John Buchanan, Jr. She, ineffably refined, identifies with the gothic cathedral, "reaching up to something beyond attainment"; her name, as Williams makes clear during the play, means "soul" in Spanish; whereas Buchanan, doctor and sensualist, defies her with the soulless anatomy chart. By play's end, however, Buchanan and Alma have traded places philosophically. Einstein Books' edition of "Summer And Smoke" contains supplementary texts: �&#x20ac; "I Rise In Flame, Cried The Phoenix", a one-act play by Tennessee Williams which presents a fictionalized version of the death of English writer D. H. Lawrence on the French Riveria; Lawrence was one of Williams' chief literary influences. �&#x20ac; An excerpt from "The Glass Menagerie", by Tennessee Williams. �&#x20ac; A few selected quotes of Tennessee Williams.</p><p></p><h2>Daily Readings From the Life of Christ, Volume 3 (Grace For Today)</h2><p><p><b>A Christian devotional on the person of Christ</b></p><p>As a Christian, you are called to keep your eyes on Jesus, the founder and finisher of your faith.

The dour Inspector's agenda aims to bring the higher-ups proof of the so-called Wild Bunch's nefarious activities; in the process, his own conduct in the old case he and his college classmates must rework and revisit comes under scrutiny.

This diary became the secret place where Ellen could confess her fears of the new marriage, her confusion over her emerging sexuality, and the nightmare that her life would become. The diary not only follows the development of a girl into womanhood, it follows the construction of the Rimbauer mansioncalled Rose Redan enormous home that would be the site of so many horrific and inexplicable tragedies in the years ahead. The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red is a rare document, one that gives us an unusual view of daily life among the aristocracy in the early 1900s, a window into one womans hidden emotional torment, and a record of the mysterious events at Rose Red that scandalized Seattle society at the timeevents that can only be fully understood now that the diary has come to light. Edited by Joyce Reardon, Ph.D. as part of her research, the diary is being published as preparations are being made by Dr. Reardon to enter Rose Red and fully investigate its disturbing history.</p><p>Dr. Joyce Reardon has been a professor at the university for 15 years, becoming the Paranormal Studies department chairman in 1999. She holds an undergraduate degree from Beaumont, graduate degrees from City College, and a doctorate in Paranormal Studies from Greenwich University. In 1998, she began researching the mysteries of Rose Red after discovering Ellen Rimbauer&#39;s diary.A mysterious and haunting spirit lurks within the walls of Rose Red, the setting for Stephen King's upcoming ABC miniseries tie-in by the same name. Built on a Native American burial ground in early 20th-century Seattle, the mansion which is constantly under construction sets the scene for a multitude of inexplicable disappearances and ghastly deaths. While moody oil tycoon John Rimbauer refuses to acknowledge that the house has a mind of its own, his young wife, Ellen, dramatizes these eerie events with great detail in her diary, often personifying the house as if it were a living being. (Or, perhaps, a non-living being?) While the evolution of Ellen's character from innocent and submissive to frighteningly powerful is a slow process, the language and questioning nature of her entries entice the reader as the mystery of Rose Red is brought into full bloom. Ellen also reveals frustration and disappointment with her marriage namely her husband's unfaithfulness and alarmingly frequent involvement in voyeuristic activities as well as a growing confusion about her sexual identity and attachment to her friend and African handmaid, Sukeena. In addition to extensive dialogue that makes the diary seem a tad more like a novel than someone's personal confessions, Ellen's entries are accompanied by a handful of explanatory notes put in by the "editor" and supposed professor of paranormal studies, Joyce Reardon. The people mentioned in the diary, as well as Reardon, are all characters in Rose Red, which was created directly for television by the bestselling author. As to who penned the actual text of the diary? That remains as much of a mystery as Rose Red herself. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Walter Breen&#39;s Complete Encyclopedia of U.S. and Colonial Coins</h2><p>Drawing on a lifetime of research, America&#39;s top coin historian presents the most comprehensive guide to U.S. coins ever published.

The other, of course, is native son Salman Rushdie--less prolific, perhaps than Bollywood, but in his own way just as fantastical. Though Rushdie's novels lack the requisite six musical numbers that punctuate every Bombay talkie, they often share basic plot points with their cinematic counterparts. Take, for example, his 1980 Booker Prize-winning <i>Midnight's Children</i>: two children born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947--the moment at which India became an independent nation--are switched in the hospital. The infant scion of a wealthy Muslim family is sent to be raised in a Hindu tenement, while the legitimate heir to such squalor ends up establishing squatters' rights to his unlucky hospital mate's luxurious bassinet. Switched babies are standard fare for a Hindi film, and one can't help but feel that Rushdie's world-view--and certainly his sense of the fantastical--has been shaped by the films of his childhood. But whereas the movies, while entertaining, are markedly mediocre, <i>Midnight's Children</i> is a masterpiece, brilliant written, wildly unpredictable, hilarious and heartbreaking in equal measure.<p> Rushdie's narrator, Saleem Sinai, is the Hindu child raised by wealthy Muslims. Near the beginning of the novel, he informs us that he is falling apart--literally: </p><blockquote>I mean quite simply that I have begun to crack all over like an old jug--that my poor body, singular, unlovely, buffeted by too much history, subjected to drainage above and drainage below, mutilated by doors, brained by spittoons, has started coming apart at the seams. In short, I am literally disintegrating, slowly for the moment, although there are signs of an acceleration.</blockquote> In light of this unfortunate physical degeneration, Saleem has decided to write his life story, and, incidentally, that of India's, before he crumbles into "(approximately) six hundred and thirty million particles of anonymous, and necessarily oblivious, dust." It seems that within one hour of midnight on India's independence day, 1,001 children were born. All of those children were endowed with special powers: some can travel through time, for example; one can change gender. Saleem's gift is telepathy, and it is via this power that he discovers the truth of his birth: that he is, in fact, the product of the illicit coupling of an Indian mother and an English father, and has usurped another's place. His gift also reveals the identities of all the other children and the fact that it is in his power to gather them for a "midnight parliament" to save the nation. To do so, however, would lay him open to that other child, christened Shiva, who has grown up to be a brutish killer. Saleem's dilemma plays out against the backdrop of the first years of independence: the partition of India and Pakistan, the ascendancy of "The Widow" Indira Gandhi, war, and, eventually, the imposition of martial law.<p> We've seen this mix of magical thinking and political reality before in the works of G�nter Grass and Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez. What sets Rushdie apart is his mad prose pyrotechnics, the exuberant acrobatics of rhyme and alliteration, pun, wordplay, proper and "Babu" English chasing each other across the page in a dizzying, exhilarating cataract of words. Rushdie can be laugh-out-loud funny, but make no mistake--this is an angry book, and its author's outrage lends his language wings. <i>Midnight's Children</i> is Salman Rushdie's irate, affectionate love song to his native land--not so different from a Bombay talkie, after all. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Born at the stroke of midnight at the exact moment of India&#x2019;s independence, Saleem Sinai is a special child. However, this coincidence of birth has consequences he is not prepared for: telepathic powers connect him with 1,000 other &#x2018;midnight&#x2019;s children&#x2019; all of whom are endowed with unusual gifts. Inextricably linked to his nation, Saleem&#x2019;s story is a whirlwind of disasters and triumphs that mirrors the course of modern India at its most impossible and glorious</p><h2>The Original Boston Cooking School Cook Book 1896</h2><p>Offers contemporary cooks a guide to preparing old-fashioned American dishes, including New England specialties and adaptations of continental dishes</p><p></p><h2>A Cabinetmaker&#39;s Notebook</h2><p>Offers anecdotes and tips from the author&#39;s experience as a cabinetmaker</p><p>James Krenov is the author of ""The Fine Art of Cabinetmaking,"" ""The Impractical Cabinetmaker,"" and ""Worker in Wood.""

This has been the most notorious crime in the past 30 years committed by Russian intelligence on foreign soil. Former Russian military intelligence officer and international expert in special operations Boris Volodarsky shows how the Russian poisoning operations started with Lenin and his Cheka, the predecessor of the KGB with intelligence operatives creating poisons and delivery methods as well as planning and carrying out poisoning operations all over the world in order to eliminate the enemies of the Kremlin. </p></p><p>Boris Volodarsky is a former captain of the GRU Spetsnaz and currently an independent intelligence analyst, a member of the World Association of International Studies (Hoover Institution, Stanford University) and has written a number of articles on intelligence for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.

In brilliant light we see what lay for nearly a century behind the London polonium poisoning of British citizen Alexander Litvinenko, former Russian. With original research guided by his insider's eye and scholarly care, Boris Volodarsky recounts scores of murders. Assassination emerges as state policy, as institutionalized bureacracy, as day-to-day routine, as laboratory science, as a branch of medicine researching ways not to stave off death but to deliver it in apparently innocent or accidental forms, and as engineering technology, devising ever-new devices to meet each new requirement, from umbrella tips and cigarette cases and rolled-up newspapers -- to Litvinenko's teacup."

In October 2006, journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a critic of President Vladimir Putin and his handling of the Chechen conflict, was shot to death in Moscow. In November 2006, former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by polonium-210 and died after several days of agony. Litvinenko was known for publicly alleging that the Russian government was behind numerous acts of terrorism against its own people, including Politkovskaya's murder. These stories are familiar to most who follow international news. What many people do not know is that this type of assassination has a long history extending through Soviet regimes as far back as Lenin. Volodarsky, a former KGB officer himself, provides evidence that eliminating enemies by poisoning or other means is still business as usual in Russia, despite the political changes of the past two decades...[<i>The KGB&#x2019;s Poison Factory</i>] will fascinate students as well as general readers interested in international espionage.</p></p><h2>Storm Runners #3: Eruption (3)</h2><p>The explosive conclusion to Roland Smith's fast-paced action series!<br><br>Chase Masters and his friends have made it through the longest night of their lives, but their adventures are far from over.

My fingertips tingle as they feel their way around the coffee table, scrabbling first for my car keys and then for my cell phone. I seem to have eight limbs as I try to get dressed in the dark, pulling on my coat and a pair of oversize sheepskin boots that I usually wear as slippers. At the threshold I hesitate for a second, then rush back to my desk and fumble in the drawer for my passport and a credit card that I keep for emergencies. I pull the door behind me in silence, although blood roars and rushes in my ears. With shaking hands I double-lock it: whether to keep someone in or to keep someone out, I can&#x2019;t know yet. </p><p>Outside, I tiptoe, but there is a crack and a squelch as I flatten a snail beneath my sole, and when I tread in a puddle by the gate, cold water seeps through the soft suede and licks unpleasantly at my bare toes. </p><p>In the dark interior of the car I turn the key in the ignition and wince as the air blows icy cold, dispersing the fluffy clouds of my breath. My hands are so cold they feel wet; I am relieved to find a pair of woolen gloves bundled in my left pocket. Before put ting them on, I use my cell phone to cover the last caller&#x2019;s tracks. I call the house phone, wait for the click of connection, and hang up before it has a chance to ring. The windshield is opaque with frost and I do not have time to wait for the heaters to defog the glass. I wipe a porthole in the passenger window and squint back into the dark recess of the bedroom window. If he had heard me, the light would be on by now. He would be silhouetted at the window, mouthing my name. Would that stop me? Would anything? </p><p>The car is pointed directly at the front of the house. If I turn the headlights on, they will shine into the window, so with no beams to guide me and only a smeared handprint of visibility through the windows, I pull out into the road. Only when I have guessed my way to the end of our lane do I switch on the full beam. The countryside is frosted and stark. Naked hedgerows cast eerie shapes in front of me and the high banks of the narrow road throw up shadows that take human form. The dead, the missing, and the missed surround me now, passive spirits who have become active ghosts. I am afraid to glance behind. They pursue me as I drive aggressively, suicidally, mounting the grass verge when I take a blind bend much too fast. The seatbelt digs into the flesh between my breasts as I make an emergency stop to avoid hitting the truck that suddenly looms in front of me. It&#x2019;s a filthy vehicle of indeterminate color, tools loose in the back, moving so slowly that the driver must be drunk. I have no option but to slow to a crawl behind him. </p><p>I ought to use this enforced pause for rational thought. But there is nothing rational about this situation. I am driving alone in pajamas and wet, clammy boots on a country lane in the middle of the night. Nobody knows where I am or why. I had only been thinking of the others, but for the first time it strikes me that my own safety might be compromised if I continue. </p><p>A glance at my speedometer tells me that we are traveling at twelve miles an hour. I toot and flash, but by the cold blue glow in his cab I see that he is making a phone call. I map the road ahead in my mind. I have driven it so often that I know every pothole, kink, and curve. I take a deep breath, crunch the gears, and plunge blindly into the passing place I calculate is just to my right. The driver of a black car coming in the opposite direction has had the same idea and we skim each other as we pass, with a sickening screech of metal on metal. I accelerate. Let him chase me if he wants to make something of it. My left-hand mirror is wrenched from its casing and falls to dangle lifelessly at the side from a lone wire, like a severed limb attached to its body by a single vein. The retreating driver sounds his horn angrily, the Doppler effect making it drop a forlorn semitone as it continues in the direction of my house. The truck is between us and it is too late to turn and see if the driver was alone or carrying a passenger, if it was a regular car or a taxi. </p><p>I pick up my crazy pace. Only a speed camera, predicted by a luminous sign, persuades my foot to the brake. On the borders of the town the scrubby roadside edges give way to narrow pavements and trees thin out to accommodate houses, a pub, a gas station. Lampposts appear, imitation Victorian globes like a parade of tiny moons, and I realize with a corresponding lucidity that this is it. The event I have been expecting and dreading for a third of my life is finally here. </p><p>It suddenly feels very hot inside the car. My hands are sweating inside my gloves, my eyes are dry, and my tongue is stuck to the roof of my mouth. I have given up so much and done so many terrible things already for the sake of my family that I can only keep going. I do not know what is going to happen to us. I am frightened, but I feel strong. I have the strength of a woman who has everything to lose. </p><p><b>1</b> </p><p>I try to see the city through his eyes. It has been only ten years, but London has changed. Will he notice the subtle developments of the last decade? Does he register the lack of telephone boxes or the proliferation of Polish grocers? What about the plugged-in pedestrians with white wires connecting their ears to their pockets? The red circles on the road that welcome us into and usher us out of the congestion zone? I&#x2019;m dying to know what he is thinking. His eyes, though, are fixed on the sycamore pods and leaves stuck under the windshield wipers. Running commentary has never been his style, but this silence is unnerving. </p><p>Alice is talking enough for the three of us, a high-pitched stream of consciousness that spills from the backseat. She has made this journey from southeast London to our home on the Suffolk coast four times a year, every year of her life. She loves traveling home through town, preferring to inch through dirty streets rather than cruise around the highway, even though it adds hours onto our journey. I always save this route for a special treat, when her behavior throughout our visit has been particularly good, or when she and Rex have found saying good-bye harder than usual. Sometimes I drive through town when I need to think, knowing that Alice&#x2019;s nose will remain pressed against the glass as the car crawls from suburb to inner city to suburb again, that the questions she asks will be about what that man is selling or what that building is, rather than another discussion about why Daddy has to live so far away. </p><p>But this afternoon&#x2019;s detour isn&#x2019;t at Alice&#x2019;s request. As we creep along Holloway Road, her favorite part of the journey, her focus is inside the car. She does not seem to mind her demotion from the front seat to the back. She ignores the Caribbean barbershop she loves to wave at and the metallic, space-age university building we saw being built, panel by shiny blue panel. We even pass the grimy cell phone store that holds such a strange fascination for her without the usual argument about when she will be old enough for her own telephone. We stop at a red light and with a click and a giggle she slides out of her seatbelt and squeezes between the driver and passenger seats. Her twiggy fingers weave in and out of Rex&#x2019;s hair, tugging it, massaging his scalp, shampooing it and revealing silver threads around his ears and temples. She shoots out rapid-fire questions one after the other without waiting for answers. </p><p>&#x201c;Will you take me to school when I go back next week? Will you drive Mum&#x2019;s car or are we going to have two? Lara&#x2019;s mum and dad have a car each but she still walks to school. Don&#x2019;t you think&#x2014;oh my God, you can come swimming now! What&#x2019;s your best stroke? Mine&#x2019;s front crawl. Will you take me swimming?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do whatever you want,&#x201d; says Rex, and Alice kisses the top of his head. Her knees fold forward and nudge the gearshift while an elbow knocks against my head as I try to negotiate the Archway traffic circle. I shout at her when I had sworn I wouldn&#x2019;t, not today. She shrugs off my scolding. The car swings to the left as I take the exit for the Great North Road. Rex crosses his legs, folds his arms, and shifts in his seat. He knows where I&#x2019;m going. Perhaps he was expecting it. Perhaps, like me, he needs this one last visit to the past before we can build our future. </p><p>Archway Road is unusually clear, and the three of us cruise underneath the bridge in the long, low autumn dazzle. The neighborhood has been gentrified in the decade since we lived here. We pass a designer baby boutique where a thrift store used to be. The liquor store that would sell us two bottles of nasty wine for five pounds, even at three in the morning, has now been upgraded to a wine merchant, and even the old pubs and restaurants look cleaner and brighter than I remember them: more plate glass, fewer metal shutters. But Archway still has some way to go, I think, as I swerve to avoid chunks of glass exploded from a bus stop window and scattered across the street like ice cubes. </p><p>Neither of us has been here for over a decade but I can still drive this street, anticipate those lights, make these gear changes, on autopilot. I could do it with my eyes shut. For a reckless second, I&#x2019;m tempted to try, to close my eyes and lock the wheel on a right curve. But I make the double turn into Queenswood Lane wide-eyed and unblinking. The noise of the city falls away as we enter the secret sliver of wildwood, where the ancient trees muffle the sirens and the screeches of the street and the half-hidden houses occupy a dark green private universe, cushioned by money as much as by trunk and bough and leaf. I drive carefully between the expensive cars, their side-view mirrors tucked into their bodies in case someone unfamiliar with the road drives too quickly and knocks into one. But I am more familiar with this lane than any other road, including the one I grew up on and the one I live on now. It&#x2019;s the setting for most of my memories and all of my nightmares. I know every old brick wall, every bump in the road, every lamppost. The 1860s apartment block with its Italianate walled garden still sits alongside that glass-and-concrete bubble, someone&#x2019;s vision of the future from the 1960s that would never make it past the conservation society today. Stern Victorian town houses tower over a pastel-colored fairy-tale mansion. Their windows glower down at us. </p><p>I deliberately don&#x2019;t look toward the last house, the place where everything happened, before the street surrenders to the trees. I focus on the road as the leafy tunnel swallows this car for the first time and park with the house behind me, telling Alice that Mummy and Daddy need to stretch their legs. She tumbles out of the car and skips into the trees, her tracksuit a flash of pink through half-undressed branches. The little red lights in the heels of her sneakers wink at us like tiny eyes. </p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go too far!&#x201d; I call. We watch as she drags her feet through the fallen leaves, tracing letters with her toes, staining the hem of her trousers with flakes of wet bark and leaf mold. She doesn&#x2019;t know it, but she&#x2019;s playing yards away from the spot where she was conceived. Rex speaks first. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s got to be done, I suppose.&#x201d; He circles the car to open my door. I get out and point the key at the car, and it locks with a pow-pow noise. Rex raises an eyebrow. &#x201c;Very swish,&#x201d; he says, taking the key from me and examining it as though it contains an entire album of high-energy dance tracks. I close my eyes to make the turn, and when I open them, there it is. Exactly where we left it, I think&#x2014;although where could it have gone? The four-story town house surrounded not by cars and concrete but by lime and plane and birch and oak; half stucco, half gray brick, it really belongs on the end of a terrace in Islington or Hackney. Its incongruity is one of the things that always made its presence on the edge of the forest so magical. It has changed, of course. It looks naked, cleaner and more metropolitan than ever now that someone has pulled down the dark green ivy that covered all of the side wall and half the front one and found its way in through the windows in the summertime. The creamy stucco gleams, not a single peel or crack in the paint. It looks innocent. But then, so do I. </p><p>The flaked black paint on the front door has been replaced by flawless turquoise gloss, and the golden lion door knocker gleams. The steep front steps&#x2014;formerly a death trap of long-dead herbs tufting out of broken terra-cotta pots, lone roller skates, empty wine bottles, and never-to-be-read free local newspapers&#x2014;have also been restored, and instead the door is flanked by two perfectly symmetrical bay trees with twisted stems in aluminum pots. Six recycling boxes are stacked neatly and discreetly behind a magnolia tree in the front garden. Instead of the nonworking bell pull which no one ever bothered with, there are six buzzers. The first time I ever came here, I spent ten minutes looking for just such a row of doorbells bearing different names. It didn&#x2019;t occur to me that people my age could live in the whole of this building rather than occupy an apartment within it. I don&#x2019;t need to get any closer to know how the place has changed on the inside. Without peering through the white-shuttered windows, I know exactly how the interiors of these apartments will look: coir or sisal carpeting, because the battered floorboards were beyond restoration even for the most dedicated property developer. The black and white hall will have been renovated, an original feature that will have added value to the house price.

(And Why Should We Care?)</h2><p><p>The most accessible, entertaining, and enlightening explanation of the best-known physics equation in the world, as rendered by two of today&#x2019;s leading scientists.</p><p>Professor Brian Cox and Professor Jeff Forshaw go on a journey to the frontier of 21st century science to consider the real meaning behind the iconic sequence of symbols that make up Einstein&#x2019;s most famous equation, E=mc2. Breaking down the symbols themselves, they pose a series of questions: What is energy? What is mass? What has the speed of light got to do with energy and mass? In answering these questions, they take us to the site of one of the largest scientific experiments ever conducted. Lying beneath the city of Geneva, straddling the Franco-Swiss boarder, is a 27 km particle accelerator, known as the Large Hadron Collider. Using this gigantic machine&#x2014;which can recreate conditions in the early Universe fractions of a second after the Big Bang&#x2014;Cox and Forshaw will describe the current theory behind the origin of mass.</p><p>Alongside questions of energy and mass, they will consider the third, and perhaps, most intriguing element of the equation: 'c' - or the speed of light. Why is it that the speed of light is the exchange rate? Answering this question is at the heart of the investigation as the authors demonstrate how, in order to truly understand why E=mc2, we first must understand why we must move forward in time and not backwards and how objects in our 3-dimensional world actually move in 4-dimensional space-time. In other words, how the very fabric of our world is constructed. A collaboration between two of the youngest professors in the UK, <i>Why Does E=mc2?</i> promises to be one of the most exciting and accessible explanations of the theory of relativity in recent years.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Brian Cox</b> is a professor of particle physicist and Royal Society University Research Fellow at the University of Manchester.

Here, in this fresh and moving account, a son returns to his native South to spend a special autumn with his ninety-five-year-old dad, sharing the unique joys, disappointments, and life lessons of Saturdays with their beloved Ole Miss Rebels.<br><br> After growing up in Jackson, Stuart Stevens built a successful career as a writer and political consultant. But in the fall of 2012, not long after he turned sixty, the presidential campaign he&#x2019;d worked on suffered a painful defeat. Grappling with a profound sense of loss and mortality, he began asking himself some tough questions, not least about his relationship with his father. The two of them had spent little time together for decades. He made a resolution: to invite his father to attend a season of Ole Miss football games together, as they&#x2019;d done when college football provided a way for his father to guide him through childhood&#x2014;and to make sense of the troubled South of the 1960s. Now, driving to and from the games, and cheering from the stands, they take stock of their lives as father and son, and as individuals, reminding themselves of their unique, complicated, precious bond. <br> &nbsp;<br> Poignant and full of heart, but also irreverent and often hilarious, <i>The Last Season </i>is a powerful story of parents and children and of the importance of taking a backward glance together while you still can.</p></p><p><b>STUART STEVENS</b> grew up in Mississippi, a seventh generation Mississippian.

I had an Ole Miss hat, sort of a cross between a baseball hat and a newsboy cap that I wore to bed most nights.&nbsp; I knew the names of every starting Rebel as though they were family members: All American quarterback Glenn Griffing, running back Lou Guy, fullback and linebacker Buck Randall. I knew them all.&nbsp; The way the radio announcers described them was how I thought of the Rebels: &#x201c;rocket armed&#x201d; Griffing; &#x201c;swivel hipped&#x201d; Guy; &#x201c;bruising&#x201d; Randal. They were like titles bestowed upon knights competing on fields of battle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was ten years old. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My parents had a party before most Ole Miss games in Jackson. My favorite was the party before the Arkansas Razorbacks game, which was always a &#x201c;hog roast&#x201d; with lots of great barbeque and a big pig. I loved the pig. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The opening game of that 1962 season was against the Kentucky Wildcats. You can&#x2019;t roast a Wildcat, but it was still a good party. They always had good parties. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The bootlegger came to the house before every party. Mississippi was the only state in the country that had not repealed prohibition so the entire state was dry and everybody had a bootlegger. Ours drove a pick-up truck with cases of booze in the back. Not very discreet but nobody really tried to hide bootlegging. The State Treasurer was even paid a percentage of a bootlegger tax that was collected. You could make a lot of money and one famous candidate for the office when asked how long he intended to serve, said, &#x201c;I figure it will only take one term.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I liked our bootlegger. He was a friendly guy who always gave me an ice-cold Coke. Once I saw a pistol in the cab of his pickup and I asked my father if he was a police officer. He laughed and said that he wasn&#x2019;t but he probably had a lot of friends who were. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The pre-game parties always ended with a couple of the Ole Miss chant, &#x201c;Hotty-toddy&#x2019;&#x201d; and a dash for the stadium. For evening games, there would be an inevitable clothing ritual with my mother that played out with the predictability of a catechism. </p><p> </p><p> &#x201c;Take a coat. It&#x2019;s going to get cool.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a jacket.&#x201d; I held up the light Ole Miss windbreaker that had been a birthday present the year before. I&#x2019;d learned not to fight these things. Submission was inevitable so best to make it speedy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &#x201c;Is that heavy enough? Shouldn&#x2019;t you wear that nice wool coat we got you for Christmas?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> The wool coat was the sort of thing that the lead character in &#x201d;Sergeant Preston of the Yukon&#x201d; wore in one of my favorite television shows. Unless the temperature plummeted 70 degrees, I knew I&#x2019;d want to abandon it on the walk to Memorial Stadium, like heavy equipment on the Russian retreat from Stalingrad. I&#x2019;d seen pictures of that in the Life Magazine book of World War Two that I kept in my room. Next to the Rebels, I was probably in love with World War Two more than anything. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay. Really, mom. I&#x2019;ve got a coat.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> As he always did at some point, my father stepped in. &#x201d;He&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; he reassured her. Then he held up the overly warm coat he had slung over his arm as a talisman to head off the next round of anti-hypothermia suggestions. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My dad and I always went to Memorial Stadium the same way: he&#x2019;d drive just a couple of miles to the parking lot of Bailey Junior High School and we&#x2019;d walk. My aunt taught at Bailey and later it was where I went to school.&nbsp; It was a formidable looking art deco structure that always reminded me, not in a positive way, of the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz.&nbsp; It was about a mile to the stadium from our usual parking spot. I loved that last stretch. Dad and I would hold hands and talk about the different ways the Rebels were going to win. He usually wore a snazzy hat and sometimes when the afternoon sun caught us just right, our shadows fell long and lean on the sidewalk, stretching his hat out in funny shapes that made me laugh. The walk never felt routine. Even from a distance, the band warming up the crowd always seemed impossibly loud. The roar probably had something to do with the sound being funneled by the structure and amplified through the crowd. But it might have been my imagination teased to a frenzy in anticipation. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Walking to the game wasn&#x2019;t like going to the Capri movie theater, our neighborhood favorite.&nbsp; Even if you didn&#x2019;t know what was going to happen in a movie, it had already been made. But the game was different. Nobody had made what was going to unfold. No one had any idea what was going to happen. We were walking to history. I imagined families all across the country huddled around radios and big cabinets televisions like the huge Zenith in our living room, listening and watching what we were going to see for real. Going to the game seemed like being on the inside of the most important secret in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> I knew that my friends at school who didn&#x2019;t go to the game would ask over and over, &#x201c;What was it like?&#x201d; Some wouldn&#x2019;t want to believe that I had really been there. I always carried the ticket stubs with me for at least a week after a game. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> On the way to the game, Confederate flags were everywhere but that was normal. What would Rebel games be without Rebel flags? Cars drove by with guys and sometimes a girl holding flags and yelling, &#x201c;Go to hell, Kentucky!&#x201d;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> I always loved the way the crowds got bigger the closer we got to the stadium. It was like seeing kids on the playground before the first day of school after the long summer. Not that I was friends with my fellow fans, or even knew more than a handful of them, but they were Rebel fans. We were Rebel fans. Perfect strangers would greet each other with, &#x201c;Hotty toddy,&#x201d; and it was like a password into our special clubhouse. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> But this time my dad steered us clear of any large groups. There was a crowd in the parking lot shouting, &#x201c;Hell, no!&#x201d; and even I could tell they were drunk. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> At halftime, Ole Miss was ahead 7-0. But my father seemed uneasy, shaking his head and talking about how &#x201c;sloppy&#x201d; the team had played. One of my favorite players, Buck Randall, had scored but the refs called it back on holding. &#x201c;We should be killin&#x2019; em,&#x201d; my dad told me and I nodded solemnly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> At soon as the teams had headed to the locker room, Colonel Reb, the Ole Miss mascot, led out the world&#x2019;s largest Confederate flag, which seemed to cover the field, followed by the Ole Miss band wearing their standard uniforms of Confederate battle dress. This was the ritual of every Ole Miss game: Colonel Reb, the giant flag and when the marching band finished its famous rendition of Dixie, the crowd would rise as one to shout, &#x201c;The South Shall Rise Again.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> But tonight, the ritual changed. A podium was placed in the center of the field and a man I had seen before but couldn&#x2019;t have named came out flanked by Mississippi Highway Patrolmen. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Ross!&#x201d; Somebody shouted. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &#x201c;Hey, Governor!&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Governor Ross Barnett looked old and addled. People were laughing. Someone handed us a leaflet with the words for &#x201c;A New Mississippi Anthem.&#x201d; The band started playing the Ross Barnet&#x2019;s campaign song that I&#x2019;d heard on the radio many times,&nbsp; &#x201c;Roll with Ross,&#x201d; but now the crowd was singing the new lyrics:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> States may sing their songs of praise</p><p> With waving flags and hip-hoo-ray&#x2019;</p><p> Let cymbals crash and let bells ring, &#x2018;Cause</p><p> Here&#x2019;s one song I&#x2019;m proud to sing:</p><p> Go Mississippi, keep rolling along.</p><p> Go Mississippi, keep rolling along.</p><p> Go, Mississippi, you cannot go wrong.</p><p> Go, Mississippi, we&#x2019;re singing your song, </p><p> M-I-S, SIS, S-I-P-P-I!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> A few people near us in the stands looked uncomfortable, but most were laughing and singing. My father pushed his hat back on his head and stared at the paper. I wanted to join in, of course, but his look told me not to. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> Ross Barnett was now waving his arms like a conductor. The crowd tore into the next verse:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <i>We will not yield an inch of any field.</i></p><p><i> Fix us another toddy, ain&#x2019;t yielding to nobody.</i></p><p><i> Ross is standing like Gibraltar, he shall never falter.</i></p><p><i> Ask us what we say, it&#x2019;s to hell with Bobby K.</i></p><p><i> Never shall our emblem go.</i></p><p><i> From Colonel Rebel to Ole Black Joe.</i> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> That was more than enough for my father. &#x201c;Time to go,&#x201d; he said and pulled on my hand. I assumed he meant time to get some hot dogs. I loved hot dogs. We started to move down our row toward an aisle. Barnett was bellowing:</p><p> </p><p> &#x201c;I love Mississippi! I love Mississippi! I love her people! Our customs! I love and respect our heritage!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> The crowd had stopped laughing and cheered wildly. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> When we got to the hot dog stands on the ground floor, I stopped because I thought it was hot dog time. My father walked ahead for a few steps then came back. &#x201c;Half time hot dog?&#x201d; he asked. He bought me one but he didn&#x2019;t look happy. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &#x201d;Aren&#x2019;t you getting one?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &#x201c;Not tonight,&#x201d; he said and instead of turning to go back into the stadium he motioned toward the exit. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go home.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &#x201c;Home?&#x201d;</p><p> </p><p> He looked at me and then rubbed his stomach. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel good.&nbsp; I ate too much at that party. We can listen to the second half at home.&#x201d; Then when he saw me hesitating, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s peach cobbler left from the party. &#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I loved the cobbler.&nbsp; I took a big bite out of the hot dog and we walked out. Ross Barnet was still shouting. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> Twenty-four hours later, the Ole Miss campus was a war zone in the last battle of the Civil War, Federal troops fighting Southerners over integration. Two weeks after that, the US and Russia would come close to war over nuclear missiles in Cuba.&nbsp; But for me, 1962 will always be most remembered as the year my father and I cheered as Ole Miss went undefeated and won the national championship. It&#x2019;s there, floating in memory, that perfect season in that most imperfect year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> There were other seasons, some good, some not so good but always shared with my father. And then life&#x2019;s wheel began to spin and days and nights spent in stadiums faded into the past. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> Until one day I woke up at the age of sixty and realized that what I wanted most in the world, was one more season. With my father and football and the Ole Miss Rebels. It didn&#x2019;t need to be a perfect season. One last season would be perfect enough. </p><p> </p></p><h2>Summer Of The Monkeys (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Among her many awards are two Newberys and two National Book Awards, and she was recently named a "Living Legend&#x201d; by the Library of Congress. She has been published in more than 22 languages in a variety of formats, from picture books to historical novels.</p>Grade 2-6-- Finding a princess who is the ``king's equal'' in comeliness, intelligence, and wealth is an order that confounds the wisest, most loyal councilors in this distant realm. Finding a book equal in quality and brilliance to this one is an even more formidable task. Paterson weaves her story within the structure of familiar fairy tales; she includes romance, repetition of language, the number three, and a moral of goodness and love triumphing over selfishness and greed. Her careful attention to the beauty and variety of descriptive language is evident on every page. The story gains dimension with the inclusion of ``the Wolf.'' At first glimpse, he seems a menacing, negative force, but he is revealed ultimately to be the purveyor of magic, and even the perfect matchmaker. He never intrudes upon court life in the capital city, but remains in his remote mountain lair, an enigmatic character to ponder at the story's end. Vagin's illustrations are exquisite, luminous in color, clarity, and precision. Readers are drawn into the courtly world of a wealthy kingdom through details of costume, architecture, furniture, and decorations. Because there are six chapters, the book is a lengthy read-aloud. This is, however, no drawback; young listeners will be a spellbound and appreciative audience, and should want to return to the book again and again. --Martha Rosen, Edgewood School, Scarsdale, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>All about the ECERS-R A Detailed Guide in Words and Pictures to Be Used with the ECERS-R</h2><p>This book is a resource guide to be used with the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised Edition.

Celebrating Christmas is so often about nostalgia. With a nod and a wink to the days of Christmas past, <i>It's a Wonderful Christmas</i> presents classic images of the Yuletide icons of mid-20th-century America.<br><br>Bubbler lights and glow-in-the-dark icicles. Catalogues crammed with toys. Norad bulletins tracking Rudolph's red nose through the nighttime sky. Along with hundreds of such quintessentially American illustrations, author Susan Waggoner stocking-stuffs her lively text with fascinating bits of information, lore, and lists. Wonder what the all-time most popular Christmas song is? How the tradition of the department store Santa got started? The answers are here. Loaded with images of vintage Christmas cards, wrapping paper, magazine ads, Lionel toy trains, and more, all in full color, this charming book will appeal to anyone who associates Christmas with home movies, "The Chipmunk Song," and Santa relaxing with an ice-cold bottle of Coca-Cola.</p><p>Susan Waggoner has written numerous books of fiction and nonfiction. She is the author of STC&#x2019;s <i>It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Christmas, Under the Tree, Classic Household Hints, </i>and, with Robert Markel, <i>Cocktail Hour, Vintage Cocktails, </i>and <i>Make Mine Vodka</i>. Waggoner lives in New York City.This cozy book bursts with the sweet nostalgia found in such movies as A Christmas Story: think fancy glass Christmas balls, Bing Crosby, tinsel and garlands, toy trains, coonskin hats and glistening roast turkey. Broken down by subject (e.g., the tree and its trimmings, the holiday shopping frenzy, popular gifts for "kids from one to 92", celebrations, food, etc.), it addresses the lighthearted and the more serious aspects of the Yuletide season. Waggoner (Vintage Cocktails) gives depth to a seemingly light subject; although the copious photographs and illustrations depict corny Christmas cards and ecstatic children discovering a load of presents under the tree on Christmas morning, the accompanying text is well researched and deftly illuminates how a great number of Christmas traditions originated during the 1940s, &#x2019;50s and &#x2019;60s.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There is nothing for them except survival&#x201a; and the precious last vestiges of their own humanity. At once brutal and tender&#x201a; despairing and hopeful&#x201a; spare of language and profoundly moving&#x201a; The Road is a fierce and haunting meditation on the tenuous divide between civilization and savagery&#x201a; and the essential &#x2014; sometime terrifying &#x2014; power of filial love. It is a masterpiece.</p><p>Best known for his Border Trilogy, hailed in the San Francisco Chronicle as "an American classic to stand with the finest literary achievements of the century," Cormac McCarthy has written ten rich and often brutal novels, including the bestselling <i>No Country for Old Men</i>, and <i>The Road</i>. Profoundly dark, told in spare, searing prose, <i>The Road</i> is a post-apocalyptic masterpiece, one of the best books we've read this year, but in case you need a second (and expert) opinion, we asked Dennis Lehane, author of equally rich, occasionally bleak and brutal novels, to read it and give us his take. Read his glowing review below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><p> </p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Dennis Lehane</strong><br><br><b>Dennis Lehane, master of the hard-boiled thriller, generated a cult following with his series about private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, wowed readers with the intense and gut-wrenching <i>Mystic River</i>, blew fans all away with the mind-bending <i>Shutter Island</i>, and switches gears with <i>Coronado</i>, his new collection of gritty short stories (and one play). </b> <br><br> Cormac McCarthy sets his new novel, <i>The Road</i>, in a post-apocalyptic blight of gray skies that drizzle ash, a world in which all matter of wildlife is extinct, starvation is not only prevalent but nearly all-encompassing, and marauding bands of cannibals roam the environment with pieces of human flesh stuck between their teeth. If this sounds oppressive and dispiriting, it is. McCarthy may have just set to paper the definitive vision of the world after nuclear war, and in this recent age of relentless saber-rattling by the global powers, it's not much of a leap to feel his vision could be not far off the mark nor, sadly, right around the corner. Stealing across this horrific (and that's the only word for it) landscape are an unnamed man and his emaciated son, a boy probably around the age of ten. It is the love the father feels for his son, a love as deep and acute as his grief, that could surprise readers of McCarthy's previous work. McCarthy's Gnostic impressions of mankind have left very little place for love. In fact that greatest love affair in any of his novels, I would argue, occurs between the Billy Parham and the wolf in <i>The Crossing</i>. But here the love of a desperate father for his sickly son transcends all else. McCarthy has always written about the battle between light and darkness; the darkness usually comprises 99.9% of the world, while any illumination is the weak shaft thrown by a penlight running low on batteries. In <i>The Road</i>, those batteries are almost out--the entire world is, quite literally, dying--so the final affirmation of hope in the novel's closing pages is all the more shocking and maybe all the more enduring as the boy takes all of his father's (and McCarthy's) rage at the hopeless folly of man and lays it down, lifting up, in its place, the oddest of all things: faith. <i>--Dennis Lehane</i><br><br> <br>**Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction <br> **New film starring Vigo Mortensen in theaters November 2008 <br> **Oprah Book Club pick <br></p><h2>They Killed Our President: 63 Reasons to Believe There Was a Conspiracy to Assassinate JFK</h2><p>Unless you&#x2019;ve been living under a rock for the past fifty years, you&#x2019;re aware of the many hypotheses that the assassination of President John F.

Like its predecessors--''Baal, '' ''Bethany's Sin, '' and ''The Night Boat''--''They Thirst'' made its initial appearance as a paperback original. In the years since, it has acquired an intensely devoted following, and is now widely regarded as one of the significant vampire novels of the 20th century. <p> The story begins in the tiny Hungarian hamlet of Krajeck, where nine-year-old Andre Palatazin awaits the return of his father from an unspecified--but clearly dangerous--mission. The man who finally returns is no longer Andre's father--is no longer, in fact, a man. Pursued by this undead entity, Andre and his mother barely escape with their lives. Decades later, Andre--now Andy--Palatazin is a homicide detective in the Los Angeles Police Department, and spends his days dealing with the quotidian terrors of a large metropolis. His life takes a darker turn when the demonic forces he first encountered in Krajeck arrive in L.A., led by an ancient vampire known as The Master. The Master's plan: to overrun the city and use it as a stepping-stone toward wider, ultimately global, domination. </p><p> ''They Thirst'' marks the earliest appearance of McCammon's penchant for epic, wide-angled narratives. With the unobtrusive ease of a natural storyteller, the author propels a wide assortment of vividly created characters through an apocalyptic scenario that combines gritty urban realism with a powerful portrait of supernatural forces at large in the modern world. The result is a genuine classic of the genre, a novel that is as fresh and absorbing today as it was more than thirty years ago.</p>Prince Vulkan, master of the vampires, has loosed his army of the undead on Los Angeles in this seamlessly written horror novel by the author of Mine. Vulkan's plan is to replace humankind, city by city, with the living dead. Four people stand in his way. Homicide detective Andy Palatazin, a Hungarian immigrant who fled this scourge as a child, is determined to stop it now. Young Tommy Chandler, whose parents were killed before his eyes, wants revenge. TV star Wes Richer hopes to save his beloved by tracking Vulkan to his lair. Father Silvera, a dying priest, believes that God has chosen him to destroy the vampire prince. Wreaking death and carnage, Vulkan proceeds to a final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. McCammon delivers terror with skillful ferocity as he pays tribute to masters of the genre and raises the standards for the craft a notch or two. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Defeat Into Victory</h2><p>Defeat into Victory</p><p>William Joseph Slim, first Viscount, was born in 1891.

Reprint.</p><p>Continuing Moorcock's saga of Elric the albino sorcerer prince and mercenary warrior (The Fortress of the Pearl, 1989, etc.), whose blade Stombringer devours the souls of those it slays. This time out, a dragon brings Elric before the ghost of Sadric his father; Sadric requires Elric to locate his soul, now reposing in a rosewood box in a far distant land, and restore it to him--or Sadric's ghost will be welded to Elric with horrid consequences. During his quest Elric will discover an ally, the mysterious warrior princess Rose; their mutual foe will be Charion, the undead agent of Chaos. Matters are complicated by the constant interference of the dangerous contending demons Arioch and Mashabak. Before he finally restores Sadric's soul, Elric learns that most of what occurs is motivated by Rose's vast scheme to revenge herself upon Charion for destroying her people. Long on philosophy and chat, short on plot and action; annoying, too, is the way the narrative slips from past to present tense and back, to no discernible purpose. A disappointing installment, seemingly cobbled hurriedly together from ill-matched parts. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Elric's quest--to rescue the soul of his long-dead father by cheating the Lords of Chaos--leads him across time and space through the many worlds of the multiverse as diverse forces oppose him at every step. Moorcock's strength as a writer lies in his bold imagery and cosmic vision as well as in his ability to depict characters that are both larger than life and genuinely appealing.

Winner of an Edgar Award and the recipient of a Gold Dagger for fiction and the Chandler-Fulbright Award, he lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and their two sons.*Starred Review* Rebus is back! Well, you didn&#x2019;t really think Rankin&#x2019;s cantankerous Edinburgh copper would stay retired, did you? Rankin has moved on since Rebus&#x2019; retirement party in Exit Music (2008), beginning a new series starring another Edinburgh cop, Malcolm Fox, but Fox couldn&#x2019;t be more different from Rebus: a reformed drunk rather than a functioning one; a rule follower rather than a habitual rule breaker; and, most important, an internal-affairs officer rather than a detective. Oil and water, right? So who could resist the temptation to put them together in the same novel? It turns out Rebus has been spending his time since retirement as a civilian volunteer in a cold-case unit; one of those cold cases, the 15-year-old disappearance of a young woman, turns very hot when Rebus finds a connection to several more recent disappearances. His bloodhound&#x2019;s scent aroused, the detective is on the trail with a vengeance, crossing lines and bending rules just like in his salad days, which, naturally, brings him afoul of Fox, who abhors Rebus&#x2019; nonconformity and is convinced the maverick must be dirty. (Or is he just jealous of his worst enemy&#x2019;s prowess as a detective?) Crime-fiction readers are trained to hate internal-affairs cops, but Rankin made us see Fox&#x2019;s humanity in The Complaints (2011) and The Impossible Dead (2011); now he sets the IA guy against our favorite bullheaded maverick. Ambiguity has never tasted so bittersweet. A gutsy experiment on Rankin&#x2019;s part and a completely successful one. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Crime-fiction fans will swarm when the news of Rebus&#x2019; return spreads, and Rankin won&#x2019;t disappoint them. --Bill Ott</p><h2>The World in a Grain: The Story of Sand and How It Transformed Civilization</h2><p><b>A finalist for the PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award</b> <br><br><b>The gripping story of the most important overlooked commodity in the world--sand--and the crucial role it plays in our lives.</b> <br><br>After water and air, sand is the natural resource that we consume more than any other--even more than oil. Every concrete building and paved road on Earth, every computer screen and silicon chip, is made from sand. From Egypt's pyramids to the Hubble telescope, from the world's tallest skyscraper to the sidewalk below it, from Chartres' stained-glass windows to your iPhone, sand shelters us, empowers us, engages us, and inspires us. It's the ingredient that makes possible our cities, our science, our lives--and our future. <br><br>And, incredibly, we're running out of it. <br><br><i>The World in a Grain</i> is the compelling true story of the hugely important and diminishing natural resource that grows more essential every day, and of the people who mine it, sell it, build with it--and sometimes, even kill for it. It's also a provocative examination of the serious human and environmental costs incurred by our dependence on sand, which has received little public attention. Not all sand is created equal: Some of the easiest sand to get to is the least useful. Award-winning journalist Vince Beiser delves deep into this world, taking readers on a journey across the globe, from the United States to remote corners of India, China, and Dubai to explain why sand is so crucial to modern life. Along the way, readers encounter world-changing innovators, island-building entrepreneurs, desert fighters, and murderous sand pirates. The result is an entertaining and eye-opening work, one that is both unexpected and involving, rippling with fascinating detail and filled with surprising characters.</p><p><b>Vince Beiser&nbsp;</b>is an award-winning journalist.&nbsp;<i>The World in a Grain</i>, his first book, was a finalist for the PEN/E.

It is about the most important solid substance on Earth, the literal foundation of modern civilization.<br><br>It is about sand.<br><br>Sand? Why is this humblest of materials, something that seems as trivial as it is ubiquitous, so significant?<br><br>Because sand is the main material that modern cities are made of. It is to cities what flour is to bread, what cells are to our bodies: the invisible but fundamental ingredient that makes up the bulk of the built environment in which most of us live.<br><br>Sand is at the core of our daily lives. Look around you right now. Is there a floor beneath you, walls around, a roof overhead? Chances are excellent they are made at least partly out of concrete. And what is concrete? It's essentially just sand and gravel glued together with cement.<br><br>Take a glance out the window. All those other buildings you see are also made from sand. So is the glass in that window. So are the miles of asphalt roads that connect all those buildings. So are the silicon chips that are the brains of your laptop and smartphone. If you're in downtown San Francisco, in lakefront Chicago, or at Hong Kong's international airport, the very ground beneath you is likely artificial, manufactured with sand dredged up from underwater. We humans bind together countless trillions of grains of sand to build towering structures, and we break apart the molecules of individual grains to make tiny computer chips.<br><br>Some of America's greatest fortunes were built on sand. Henry J. Kaiser, one of the wealthiest and most powerful industrialists of twentieth-century America, got his start selling sand and gravel to road builders in the Pacific Northwest. Henry Crown, a billionaire who once owned the Empire State Building, began his own empire with sand dredged from Lake Michigan that he sold to developers building Chicago's skyscrapers. Today the construction industry worldwide consumes some $130 billion worth of sand each year.<br><br>Sand lies deep in our cultural consciousness. It suffuses our language. We draw lines in it, build castles in it, hide our heads in it. In medieval Europe (and a classic Metallica song), the Sandman helped ease us into sleep. In our modern mythologies, the Sandman is a DC superhero and a Marvel supervillain. In the creation myths of indigenous cultures from West Africa to North America, sand is portrayed as the element that gives birth to the land. Buddhist monks and Navajo artisans have painted with it for centuries. "Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives," intone the opening credits of a classic American soap opera. William Blake encouraged us to "see a world in a grain of sand." Percy Bysshe Shelley reminded us that even the mightiest of kings end up dead and forgotten, while around them only "the lone and level sands stretch far away." Sand is both minuscule and infinite, a means of measurement and a substance beyond measuring.<br><br>Sand has been important to us for centuries, even millennia. People have used it for construction since at least the time of the ancient Egyptians. In the fifteenth century, an Italian artisan figured out how to turn sand into fully transparent glass, which made possible the microscopes, telescopes, and other technologies that helped drive the Renaissance's scientific revolution.<br><br>But it was only with the advent of the modern industrialized world, in the decades just before and after the turn of the twentieth century, that people really began to harness the full potential of sand and begin making use of it on a colossal scale. It was during this period that sand went from being a resource used for widespread but artisanal purposes to becoming the essential building block of civilization, the key material used to create mass-manufactured structures and products demanded by a fast-growing population.<br><br>At the dawn of the twentieth century, almost all of the world's large structures-apartment blocks, office buildings, churches, palaces, fortresses-were made with stone, brick, clay, or wood. The tallest buildings on Earth stood fewer than ten stories high. Roads were mostly paved with broken stone, or more likely, not paved at all. Glass in the form of windows or tableware was a relatively rare and expensive luxury. The mass manufacture and deployment of concrete and glass changed all that, reshaping how and where people lived in the industrialized world.<br><br>Then in the years leading up to the twenty-first century, the use of sand expanded tremendously again, to fill needs both old and unprecedented. Concrete and glass began rapidly expanding their dominion from wealthy Western nations to the entire world. At roughly the same time, digital technology, powered by silicon chips and other sophisticated hardware made with sand, began reshaping the global economy in ways gargantuan and quotidian.<br><br>Today, your life depends on sand. You may not realize it, but sand is there, making the way you live possible, in almost every minute of your day. We live in it, travel on it, communicate with it, surround ourselves with it.<br><br>Wherever you woke up this morning, chances are good it was in a building made at least partly out of sand. Even if the walls are made of brick or wood, the foundation is most likely concrete. Maybe it's also plastered with stucco, which is mostly sand. The paint on your walls likely contains finely ground silica sand to make it more durable, and may include other forms of high-purity sands to increase its brightness, oil absorption, and color consistency.<br><br>You flicked on the light, provided by a glass bulb made from melted sand. You meandered to the bathroom, where you brushed your teeth over a sink made of sand-based porcelain, using water filtered through sand at your local purification plant. Your toothpaste likely contained hydrated silica, a form of sand that acts as a mild abrasive to help remove plaque and stains.<br><br>Your underwear snapped into place thanks to an elastic made with silicone, a synthetic compound also derived from sand. (Silicone also helps shampoo make your hair shinier, makes shirts less wrinkle-prone, and reinforced the boot sole with which Neil Armstrong made the first footprint on the moon. And yes, most famously, it has been used to enhance women's busts for more than fifty years.)<br><br>Dressed and ready, you drove to work on roads made of concrete or asphalt. At the office, the screen of your computer, the chips that run it, and the fiber-optic cables that connect it to the Internet are all made from sand. The paper you print your memos on is probably coated with a sand-based film that helps it absorb printer ink. Even the glue that makes your sticky notes stick is derived from sand.<br><br>At day's end, you flopped down with a glass of wine. Guess what? Sand was used to make the bottle, the glass, and even the wine. Wine is sometimes made with a dash of colloidal silica, a gel form of silicon dioxide used as a "fining" agent to improve the beverage's clarity, color stability, and shelf life.<br><br>Sand, in short, is the essential ingredient that makes modern life possible. Without sand, we couldn't have contemporary civilization.<br><br>And believe it or not, we are starting to run out.<br><br>Though the supply might seem endless, usable sand is a finite resource like any other. (Desert sand generally doesn't work for construction; shaped by wind rather than water, desert grains are too round to bind together well.) We use more of this natural resource than of any other except air and water. Humans are estimated to consume nearly 50 billion tons of sand and gravel every year. That's enough to blanket the entire state of California. It's also twice as much as we were using just a decade ago.<br><br>Today, there is so much demand for sand that riverbeds and beaches around the world are being stripped bare of their precious grains. Farmlands and forests are being torn up. And people are being imprisoned, tortured, and murdered. All over sand.<br><br>The key factor driving our world's unprecedented consumption of this humblest of materials is this: the number and size of cities is exploding. Every year there are more and more people on the planet, and every year more and more of them move to cities, especially in the developing world.<br><br>The scale of this migration is staggering. In 1950, some 746 million people-less than one-third of the world's population-lived in cities. Today, the number is almost 4 billion, more than half of all the people on Earth. The United Nations predicts that another 2.5 billion will join them in the next three decades. The global urban population is rising by about 65 million people annually; that's the equivalent of adding eight New York Citys to the planet every single year.<br><br>To build these cities of concrete, asphalt, and glass, humans are pulling sand out of the ground in exponentially increasing amounts. The overwhelming bulk of it goes to make concrete, by far the world's most important building material. In a typical year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, the world uses enough concrete to build a wall 88 feet high and 88 feet wide right around the equator. China alone used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the United States used in the entire twentieth century.<br><br>There is such intense need for certain types of construction sand that places like Dubai, which sits on the edge of an enormous desert in the Arabian Peninsula, are importing sand from Australia. That's right: exporters in Australia are literally selling sand to Arabs.<br><br>What is sand, anyway? That simple syllable comprises a panoply of tiny objects of many shapes and sizes made of many different substances. As defined by the Udden-Wentworth scale, the most commonly used geologic standard, the term sand encompasses loose grains of any hard material with a diameter between 2 and 0.0625 millimeters. That means the average grain of sand is a tad larger than the width of a human hair. Those grains can be made by glaciers grinding up stones, by oceans degrading seashells and corals (many Caribbean beaches are made of decomposed shells), even by volcanic lava chilling and shattering upon contact with air or water. (That�s where Hawaii�s black sand beaches come from.)<br><br>Nearly 70 percent of all sand grains on Earth, however, are quartz. These are the ones that matter most to us. Quartz is a form of silicon dioxide, or SiO2, also known as silica. Its components, silicon and oxygen, are the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust, so it's no surprise that quartz is one of the most common minerals on Earth. It is found abundantly in the granite and other rocks that form the world's mountains and other geologic features.<br><br>Most of the quartz grains we use were formed by erosion. Wind, rain, freeze-thaw cycles, microorganisms, and other forces eat away at mountains and other rock formations, breaking grains off their exposed surfaces. Rain then washes those grains downhill, sweeping them into rivers that carry countless tons of them far and wide. This waterborne sand accumulates in riverbeds, on riverbanks, and on the beaches where the rivers meet the sea. Over the centuries, rivers periodically overflow their banks and shift their courses, leaving behind huge deposits of sand in what has become dry land. Quartz is tremendously hard, which is why quartz grains survive this long, bruising journey intact while other mineral grains disintegrate.<br><br>Over millions of years, sands are often buried under newer layers of sediment, uplifted into new mountains, then eroded and transported once again. "Sand grains have no souls, but they are reincarnated," writes geologist Raymond Siever in his book Sand. "Each cycle of deposition, burial, uplift and erosion renews the sand grains and rounds each grain a little more." The average time for this cycle is 200 million years. The next time you dump sand out of your shoes, give those grains a little respect: they may predate the dinosaurs.<br><br>In the wild, quartz always comes mixed with bits of other materials: iron, feldspar, whatever other minerals prevail in the local geology. (Pure quartz is transparent, but quartz grains are often stained by oxidation. That coloring, plus the presence of other types of grains, is why most beaches and sand deposits you see are various shades of yellow or brown.) A certain amount of those other substances need to be filtered out before the sand can be used to make concrete, glass, or other products.<br><br>You can think of sand sort of like a colossal army, or a group of related armies, made up of quintillions of tiny soldiers. Only these armies are deployed not to kill, but to create. Rather than destroy, these soldiers build structures and products and perform services for us.<br><br>At first glance, sand grains, like uniformed troops, all look pretty much the same. In fact, though, there are many different types, with different attributes, strengths, and weaknesses, which in turn determine the uses to which they can be put. Some are prized for their hardness, some for their pliancy; some for their roundness, some for their angularity; some for their color, some for their purity. Some sands, like specially chosen commandos, are put through elaborate physical or chemical processes to alter their capabilities, or are combined with other materials to perform tasks they could not in their original state.<br><br>Construction sand-the hard, angular grains used primarily to make concrete-are the infantry of this army. This kind of sand is abundant, easily found, and not especially pure. Its grains are mainly quartz, but include other minerals, which vary depending on where the sand was mined. Construction sand can be found in virtually every country, often mixed with its indispensable partner, gravel. The construction industry refers to sand and gravel together as aggregate; the difference between sand and gravel is mainly just size. These particles are drafted into service from riverbeds, beaches, or land quarries. Sand and gravel aggregates are put to work together to make concrete, while sand is deployed on its own to make other construction materials like mortar, plaster, and roofing components.<br><br>Marine sands-the naval wing of the army, found on the ocean floor-are of similar composition, making them useful for artificial land building, such as Dubai's famous palm-tree-shaped man-made islands. These underwater grains can also be used for concrete, but that requires washing the salt off them-an expensive step most contractors would rather avoid.<br><br>Silica sands are purer-at least 95 percent silica-and are found in fewer places than construction or marine sand. Also called industrial sands, they're the Special Forces of the sand army, capable of being put to more sophisticated purposes than the average foot soldier. These are the sands you need to make glass. Higher-purity sands are especially prized: the sands of north-central France's Fontainebleau region, for instance, are upward of 98 percent pure silica. Europe's finest glassmakers have relied on them for centuries. Silica sands are also used to help make molds for metal foundries, add luster to paint, and filter the water in swimming pools, among many other tasks. Some of the unique properties of industrial sands suit them for highly specific jobs. The silica sands of western Wisconsin, for instance, have a particular shape and structure that make them ideal for use in fracking for oil and gas.</p><h2>Not Man Apart: Photographs of the Big Sur Coast</h2><p>Pays tribute to the untamed natural beauty of the California coast and presents an urgent plea for its protection</p><p></p><h2>When the Lion Feeds</h2><p>The bestselling novel that launched Wilbur Smith`s bestselling career, this is the first in the riveting saga of the Courtney brothers. `Franois, how many men up at the face?` `Cave-in.` Franois`s voice was now hysterically shrill. `Cave-in.` He broke Sean`s grip and raced away towards the lift station, the mud flying from his gumboots.

Unexpectedly, a stranger slips her a photograph of a skeleton and assures her it is the key to the victim's death. Before she knows it, Tempe is involved in an international mystery as old as Jesus, and one that could lead to the rewriting of two thousand years of religious history. <br> As Tempe investigates, she learns that the stranger's picture shows bones uncovered during an archaeological dig. She discovers the Montreal shooting victim ran an import business that just might have been a front for the trading of black market antiquities. Along with Detective Andrew Ryan and biblical archaeologist Jake Drum, Tempe travels to Israel to probe the origins of the skeleton and the ancient crypt in which it was found. Together they make a startling discovery that raises radical questions about Christ's death and places them squarely in the middle of a swirling controversy. Could one of the tombs really be Christ's last resting place? Are the bones in the ancient ossuary the last remnants of James, the brother of Jesus, as the inscription claims? Or has someone concocted an elaborate hoax? <br> Using her skills as a forensic scientist, Tempe plunges into the most controversial case of her career. The stakes have never been higher -- the more she learns, the greater the danger. And though Ryan is sexier and more engaging than ever, he may not be able to protect Tempe in this place where there seem to be so many foes. <br> Cross Bones, with its lightning pace, intricately plotted story, riveting and state-of-the-art forensic detail, is Kathy Reichs's most compelling and dramatic novel yet.</p><p>Kathy Reichs&#x2019;s first novel <i>D�j� Dead</i> was a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and won the 1997 Ellis Award for Best First Novel. <i>A Conspiracy of Bones</i> is Kathy&#x2019;s nineteenth entry in her series featuring forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan.

A decade later, I'm still commuting, and lay claim to the mother lode of frequent flyer miles. </p><p> Pelletier's <i>demande d'expertise en anthropologie</i> was on my desk when I arrived in Montreal for my February rotation. </p><p> It was now Wednesday, February 16, and the chimney bones formed a complete skeleton on my worktable. Though the victim hadn't been a believer in regular checkups, eliminating dental records as an option, all skeletal indicators fit Bellemare. Age, sex, race, and height estimates, along with surgical pins in the right fibula and tibia, told me I was looking at the long-lost Cowboy. </p><p> Other than a hairline fracture of the cranial base, probably caused by the unplanned chimney dive, I'd found no evidence of trauma. </p><p> I was pondering how and why a man goes up on a roof and falls down the chimney, when the phone rang. </p><p> "It seems I need your assistance, Temperance." Only Pierre LaManche called me by my full name, hitting hard on the last syllable, and rhyming it with "sconce" instead of "fence." LaManche had assigned himself a cadaver that I suspected might present decomposition issues. </p><p> "Advanced putrefaction?" </p><p> <i>"Oui."</i> My boss paused. "And other complicating factors." </p><p> "Complicating factors?" </p><p> "Cats." </p><p> Oh, boy. </p><p> "I'll be right down." </p><p> After saving the Bellemare report on disk, I left my lab, passed through the glass doors separating the medico-legal section from the rest of the floor, turned into a side corridor, and pushed a button beside a solitary elevator. Accessible only through the two secure levels comprising the LSJML, and through the coroner's office below on eleven, this lift had a single destination: the morgue. </p><p> Descending to the basement, I reviewed what I'd learned at that morning's staff meeting. </p><p> Avram Ferris, a fifty-six-year-old Orthodox Jew, had gone missing a week earlier. Ferris's body had been discovered late yesterday in a storage closet on the upper floor of his place of business. No signs of a break-in. No signs of a struggle. Employee said he'd been acting odd. Death by self-inflicted gunshot wound was the on-scene assessment. The man's family was adamant in its rejection of suicide as an explanation. </p><p> The coroner had ordered an autopsy. Ferris's relatives and rabbi had objected. Negotiations had been heated. </p><p> I was about to see the compromise that had been reached. </p><p> And the handiwork of the cats. </p><p> From the elevator, I turned left, then right toward the morgue. Nearing the outer door to the autopsy wing, I heard sounds drifting from the family room, a forlorn little chamber reserved for those called upon to identify the dead. </p><p> Soft sobbing. A female voice. </p><p> I pictured the bleak little space with its plastic plants and plastic chairs and discreetly curtained window, and felt the usual ache. We did no hospital autopsies at the LSJML. No end-stage liver disease. No pancreatic cancer. We were scripted for murder, suicide, accidental and sudden and unexpected death. The family room held those just ambushed by the unthinkable and unforeseen. Their grief never failed to touch me. </p><p> Pulling open a bright blue door, I proceeded down a narrow corridor, passing computer stations, drying racks, and stainless steel carts on my right, more blue doors on my left, each labeled salle d'autopsie. At the fourth door, I took a deep breath and entered. </p><p> Along with the skeletal, I get the burned, the mummified, the mutilated, and the decomposed. My job is to restore the identity death has erased. I frequently use room four since it is outfitted with special ventilation. This morning the system was barely keeping up with the odor of decay. </p><p> Some autopsies play to an empty house. Some pack them in. Despite the stench, Avram Ferris's postmortem was standing room only. </p><p> LaManche. His autopsy tech, Lisa. A police photographer. Two uniforms. A S�r�t� du Qu�bec detective I didn't know. Tall guy, freckled, and paler than tofu. </p><p> An SQ detective I <i>did</i> know. Well. Andrew Ryan. Six-two. Sandy hair. Viking blue eyes. </p><p> We nodded to each other. Ryan the cop. Tempe the anthropologist. </p><p> If the official players weren't crowd enough, four outsiders formed a shoulder-to-shoulder wall of disapproval at the foot of the corpse. </p><p> I did a quick scan. All male. Two midfifties, two maybe closing out their sixties. Dark hair. Glasses. Beards. Black suits. Yarmulkes. </p><p> The wall regarded me with appraising eyes. Eight hands stayed clasped behind four rigid backs. </p><p> LaManche lowered his mask and introduced me to the quartet of observers. </p><p> "Given the condition of Mr. Ferris's body, an anthropologist is needed." </p><p> Four puzzled looks. </p><p> "Dr. Brennan's expertise is skeletal anatomy." LaManche spoke English. "She is fully aware of your special needs." </p><p> Other than careful collection of all blood and tissue, I hadn't a clue of their special needs. </p><p> "I'm very sorry for your loss," I said, pressing my clipboard to my chest. </p><p> Four somber nods. </p><p> Their loss lay at center stage, plastic sheeting stretched between his body and the stainless steel. More sheeting had been spread on the floor below and around the table. Empty tubs, jars, and vials sat ready on a rolling cart. </p><p> The body had been stripped and washed, but no incision had been made. Two paper bags lay flattened on the counter. I assumed LaManche had completed his external exam, including tests for gunpowder and other trace evidence on Ferris's hands. </p><p> Eight eyes tracked me as I crossed to the deceased. Observer number four reclasped his hands in front of his genitals. </p><p> Avram Ferris didn't look like he'd died last week. He looked like he'd died during the Clinton years. His eyes were black, his tongue purple, his skin mottled olive and eggplant. His gut was distended, his scrotum ballooned to the size of beach balls. </p><p> I looked to Ryan for an explanation. </p><p> "Temperature in the closet was pushing ninety-two," he said. </p><p> "Why so hot?" </p><p> "We figure one of the cats brushed the thermostat," Ryan said. </p><p> I did a quick calculation. Ninety-two Fahrenheit. About thirty-five Celsius. No wonder Ferris was setting a land record for decomposition. </p><p> But heat had been just one of this gentleman's problems. </p><p> When hungry, the most docile among us grow cranky. When starved, we grow desperate. Id overrides ethics. We eat. We survive. That common instinct drives herd animals, predators, wagon trains, and soccer teams. </p><p> Even Fido and Fluffy go vulture. </p><p> Avram Ferris had made the mistake of punching out while trapped with two domestic shorthairs and a Siamese. </p><p> And a short supply of Friskies. </p><p> I moved around the table. </p><p> Ferris's left temporal and parietal bones were oddly splayed. Though I couldn't see the occipital, it was obvious the back of his head had taken a hit. </p><p> Pulling on gloves, I wedged two fingers under the skull and palpated. The bone yielded like sludge. Only scalp tissue was keeping the flip side together. </p><p> I eased the head down and examined the face. </p><p> It was difficult to imagine what Ferris had looked like in life. His left cheek was macerated. Tooth marks scored the underlying bone, and fragments glistened opalescent in the angry red stew. </p><p> Though swollen and marbled, Ferris's face was largely intact on the right. </p><p> I straightened, considered the patterning of the mutilation. Despite the heat and the smell of putrefaction, the cats hadn't ventured to the right of Ferris's nose or south to the rest of the body. </p><p> I understood why LaManche needed me. </p><p> "There was an open wound on the left side of the face?" I asked him. </p><p> "Oui. And another at the back of the skull. The putrefaction and scavenging make it impossible to determine bullet trajectory." </p><p> "I'll need a full set of cranial X-rays," I said to Lisa. </p><p> "Orientation?" </p><p> "All angles. And I'll need the skull." </p><p> "Impossible." Observer four again came alive. "We have an agreement." </p><p> LaManche raised a gloved hand. "I have the responsibility to determine the truth in this matter." </p><p> "You gave your word there would be no retention of specimens." Though the man's face was the color of oatmeal, a pink bud was mushrooming on each of his cheeks. </p><p> "Unless absolutely unavoidable." LaManche was all reason. </p><p> Observer four turned to the man on his left. Observer three raised his chin and gazed d...</p></p><h2>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid: A Memoir</h2><p>From one of the most beloved and bestselling authors in the English language, a vivid, nostalgic and utterly hilarious memoir of growing up in the middle of the United States in the middle of the last century. A book that delivers on the promise that it is &#x201c;laugh-out-loud funny.&#x201d;<br><br>Some say that the first hints that Bill Bryson was not of Planet Earth came from his discovery, at the age of six, of a woollen jersey of rare fineness. Across the moth-holed chest was a golden thunderbolt. It may have looked like an old college football sweater, but young Bryson knew better. It was obviously the Sacred Jersey of Zap, and proved that he had been placed with this innocuous family in the middle of America to fly, become invisible, shoot guns out of people&#x2019;s hands from a distance, and wear his underpants over his jeans in the manner of Superman.<br><br>Bill Bryson&#x2019;s first travel book opened with the immortal line, &#x201c;I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to.&#x201d; In this hilarious new memoir, he travels back to explore the kid he once was and the weird and wonderful world of 1950s America. He modestly claims that this is a book about not very much: about being small and getting much larger slowly. But for the rest of us, it is a laugh-out-loud book that will speak volumes &#x2013; especially to anyone who has ever been young.</p><p>Bill Bryson&#x2019;s bestselling books include <b>A Walk in the Woods</b>, <b>Neither Here Nor There</b>, <b>In a Sunburned Country</b>, <b>Bryson&#x2019;s Dictionary of Troublesome Words</b>, and <b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b>, the latter of which earned him the 2004 Aventis Prize. Bryson lives in England with his wife and children.<b>EXCERPT<br>Burns Unit<br><br></b>The only downside of my mother&#x2019;s working was that it put a little pressure on her with regard to running the home and particularly with regard to dinner, which frankly was not her strong suit anyway. My mother always ran late and was dangerously forgetful into the bargain. You soon learned to stand aside about ten to six every evening, for it was then that she would fly in the back door, throw something in the oven, and disappear into some other quarter of the house to embark on the thousand other household tasks that greeted her each evening. In consequence she nearly always forgot about dinner until a point slightly beyond way too late. As a rule you knew it was time to eat when you could hear baked potatoes exploding in the oven. <br><br>We didn&#x2019;t call it the kitchen in our house. We called it the Burns Unit. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bit burned,&#x201d; my mother would say apologetically at every meal, presenting you with a piece of meat that looked like something &#x2014; a much-loved pet perhaps &#x2014; salvaged from a tragic house fire. &#x201c;But I think I scraped off most of the burned part,&#x201d; she would add, overlooking that this included every bit of it that had once been flesh. <br><br>Happily, all this suited my father. His palate only responded to two tastes &#x2014; burnt and ice cream &#x2014; so everything suited him so long as it was sufficiently dark and not too startlingly flavorful. Theirs truly was a marriage made in heaven for no one could burn food like my mother or eat it like my dad. <br><br>As part of her job, my mother bought stacks of housekeeping magazines &#x2014; <i>House Beautiful, House and Garden, Better Homes and Gardens</i> &#x2014; and I read these with a curious avidity, partly because they were always lying around and in our house all idle moments were spent reading something, and partly because they depicted lives so absorbingly at variance with our own. The housewives in my mother&#x2019;s magazines were so collected, so organized, so calmly on top of things, and their food was perfect &#x2014; their <i>lives</i> were perfect. They dressed up to take their food out of the oven! There were no black circles on the ceiling above their stoves, no mutating goo climbing over the sides of their forgotten saucepans. Children didn&#x2019;t have to be ordered to stand back every time they opened <i>their</i> oven doors. And their foods &#x2014; baked Alaska, lobster Newburg, chicken cacciatore &#x2014; why, these were dishes we didn&#x2019;t even dream of, much less encounter, in Iowa. <br><br>Like most people in Iowa in the 1950s, we were more cautious eaters in our house.* On the rare occasions when we were presented with food with which we were not comfortable or familiar &#x2014; on planes or trains or when invited to a meal cooked by someone who was not herself from Iowa &#x2014; we tended to tilt it up carefully with a knife and examine it from every angle as if it determining whether it might need to be defused. Once on a trip to San Francisco my father was taken by friends to a Chinese restaurant and he described it to us afterwards in the somber tones of someone recounting a near-death experience. <br><br>&#x201c;And they eat it with sticks, you know,&#x201d; he added knowledgeably.<br><br>&#x201c;Goodness!&#x201d; said my mother.<br><br>&#x201c;I would rather have gas gangrene than go through that again,&#x201d; my father added grimly.<br><br>In our house we didn&#x2019;t eat: <br><br>� pasta, rice, cream cheese, sour cream, garlic, mayonnaise, onions, corned beef, pastrami, salami, or foreign food of any type, except French toast; <br>� bread that wasn&#x2019;t white and at least 65 percent air; <br>� spices other than salt, pepper and maple syrup; <br>� fish that was any shape other than rectangular and not coated in bright orange breadcrumbs, and then only on Fridays and only when my mother remembered it was Friday, which in fact was not often; <br>� seafood of any type but especially seafood that looked like large insects; <br>� soups not blessed by Campbell&#x2019;s and only a very few of those; <br>� anything with dubious regional names like &#x201c;pone,&#x201d; or &#x201c;gumbo&#x201d; or foods that had at any time been an esteemed staple of slaves or peasants. <br><br>All other foods of all types &#x2014; curries, enchiladas, tofu, bagels, sushi, couscous, yogurt, kale, rocket, Parma ham, any cheese that was not a vivid bright yellow and shiny enough to see your reflection in &#x2014; had either not yet been invented or was yet unknown to us. We really were radiantly unsophisticated. I remember being surprised to learn at quite an advanced age that a shrimp cocktail was not, as I had always imagined, a pre-dinner alcoholic drink with a shrimp in it. <br><br>All our meals consisted of leftovers. My mother had a seemingly inexhaustible supply of foods that had already been to the table, sometimes many times. Apart from a few perishable dairy products, everything in the fridge was older than I was, sometimes by many years. (Her oldest food possession of all, it more or less goes without saying, was a fruitcake that was kept in a metal tin and dated from the colonial period.) I can only assume that my mother did all of her cooking in the 1940s so that she could spend the rest of her life surprising herself with what she could find under cover at the back of the fridge. I never knew her to reject a food. The rule of thumb seemed to be that if you opened the lid and the stuff inside didn&#x2019;t make you actually recoil and take at least one staggered step backwards, it was deemed OK to eat. <br><br>Both of my parents had grown up in the Great Depression and neither of them ever threw anything away if they could possibly avoid it. My mother routinely washed and dried paper plates, and smoothed out for reuse spare aluminum foil. If you left a pea on your plate, it became part of future meal. All our sugar came in little packets spirited out of restaurants in deep coat pockets, as did our jams, jellies, crackers (oyster <i>and</i> saltine), tartar sauces, some of our ketchup and butter, all of our napkins, and a very occasional ashtray; anything that came with a restaurant table really. One of the happiest moments in my parents&#x2019; life was when maple syrup started to be served in small disposable packets and they could add those to the household hoard. <br><br>*In fact like most other people in America. It is perhaps worth noting that the leading American food writer of the age, Duncan Hines, author of the hugely successful <i>Adventures in Eating</i>, declared with pride that he never ate food with French names if he could possibly help it. Hines&#x2019;s other boast was that he did not venture out of America until he was seventy years old, when he made a trip to Europe. He disliked nearly everything he found there, especially the food.</p><h2>The Magic School Bus on the Ocean Floor</h2><p>Assuming they are simply going on an ordinary field trip to the beach, Ms. Frizzle&#39;s students enjoy a pleasant surprise when their teacher drives right into the ocean.</p><p>Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen, the author and illustrator of the Magic School Bus books, have collaborated for twenty years, bringing humor and true kidlike curiosity to science and learning. Booklist heralded Ms. Frizzle as &#34;the wackiest, wisest teacher in picture books.&#34; Two MSB titles have been named School Library Journal Best Books of the Year, and they have won countless state book awards, from New York to Nebraska.In her zany approach to science, Ms. Frizzle literally immerses her students in a sea of knowledge. Expecting a normal, end-of-the-year beach day, the class is shocked when "the Friz" drives the school bus through the parking lot, over the beach (with a quick lecture on the intertidal zone), and into the ocean depths. During this fanciful yet scientifically accurate romp, the bus appropriately metamorphoses into a submarine, a submersible, a glass-bottom boat, and--in a final flourish--a titanic surfboard. All the while, Ms. Frizzle's students (and Cole's readers) experience the wet wonders of potentially dry textbook subjects: where sand comes from, why oceans are salty, how fish breathe, the "not-fish" sea animals, underwater food chains, life in hot water vents and coral reefs. Weighty information is buoyantly supported by energetic, cartoony illustrations with bubbles of comical true-to-life kid-talk. Elementary readers will giggle at the side-story of Lenny, a lifeguard suffering delusions of heroism. Cole and Degen continue to hone their unique mix of humor, fact and sound teaching techniques. Like others in the series, this book will capture readers at school and at home.

All are essential to the well-staffed space vessel. Since the early days of interstellar travel, when Tuxedo Thomas, a Maine coon cat, showed what a cat could do for a ship and its crew, the so-called Barque Cats have become highly prized crew members. Thomas's carefully bred progeny, ably assisted by humans&#x2014;Cat Persons&#x2014;with whom they share a deep and loving bond, now travel the galaxy, responsible for keeping spacecraft free of vermin, for alerting human crews to potential environmental hazards, and for acting as morale officers.<br><br>Even among Barque Cats, Chessie is something special. Her pedigree, skills, and intelligence, as well as the close rapport she has with her human, Janina, make her the most valuable crew member aboard the Molly Daise. And the litter of kittens in her belly only adds to her value.<br><br>Then the unthinkable happens. Chessie is kidnapped&#x2014;er, catnapped&#x2014;from Dr. Jared Vlast's vet clinic at Hood Station by a grizzled spacer named Carl Poindexter. But Chessie's newborn kittens turn out to be even more extraordinary than their mother. For while Chessie's connection to Janina is close and intuitive, the bond that the kitten Chester forms with Carl's son, Jubal, is downright telepathic. And when Chester is sent into space to learn his trade, neither he nor Jubal will rest until they're reunited.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the announcement of a widespread epidemic affecting livestock on numerous planets throws their future into doubt. Suddenly the galactic government announces a plan to impound and possibly destroy all exposed animals. Not even the Barque Cats will be spared.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the clock racing against them, Janina, Jubal, Dr. Vlast, and a handful of very special kittens will join forces with the mysterious Pshaw-Ra&#x2014;an alien-looking cat with a hidden agenda&#x2014;to save the Barque Cats, other animals, and quite possibly the universe as they know it from total destruction.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne McCaffrey, the Hugo Award&#x2013;winning author of the bestselling Dragonriders of Pern novels, is one of science fiction's most popular authors.

She lives on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.<i>Chapter&nbsp;One<br></i><br>&nbsp;"How much for that pretty kittycat you got there, young lady?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Janina started, jarring Chessie out of her brooding nap. Chessie laid her ears back, stretched, and gazed up into the face of the man who stood smiling down at them. He was a grizzled-looking spacer in the middle of the human life span, she judged, wearing a uniform, the arms of which sported a collection of ships' patches bearing insignias she did not recognize. But then, Hood Station, where they had just docked, was a backwater facility providing the interface between the agro-based planet Sherwood and the rest of the universe. A wide variety of human types roamed the corridors. Though the man didn't seem threatening, he certainly seemed ignorant about cats, as Janina, Chessie's Cat Person, immediately informed him. Had Janina been a cat, Chessie thought, she'd have been bristling.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Excuse me, sir, but if you are referring to Thomas's Duchess, descendant of Tuxedo Thomas, the original Barque Cat himself, she is not for sale at any price." Janina tightened her arms protectively around Chessie's kitten-heavy body. &nbsp; "Beggin' your pardon, miss, I had no idea the lady was such a celebrity. She's just such a beauty and I'm looking for a cat for my kid. Looks like she's going to litter soon. How many kittens do you reckon she's got in there?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Dr. Vlast says no fewer than five and perhaps as many as eight!" Janina replied proudly. "Chessie is a good breeder and a good mother."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Glad to hear it. Glad to hear it. Still, that's a lot of kittens. You'll be looking for homes for them, won't you?"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>This fellow just didn't get it, did he? Chessie knew her kittens were far too valuable to be given away as pets! How could a spacer not know the history of Barque Cats? Had she been able to speak to Janina, she'd have asked, "Doesn't he know we save lives, that we patrol the tight areas of our spaceships, keeping rodents from eating the coating on cables, smelling hazardous gases and even escaping oxygen?" Chessie looked into Janina's face, which was flushing a pretty pink, and mewed her confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Chessie's-the Duchess's-kittens were spoken for three litters ago, sir," Janina informed him politely, then added, reeling off the little speech the crew's communication's officer had prepared for her, "They are highly prized, as her progeny are not only superbly bred but have all grown into the best ships' cats in the universe. The sire of this particular litter is Space Jockey, a cat as renowned as the Duchess herself for his breeding and spirit."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Hah! The truth was that although Jock was a handsome tom, he was a terrible brawler. That trait accounted for the rambunctiousness of these unborn babies of his. Chessie had never carried a more active litter, and that was saying something! She had borne twelve litters in fewer years, barely having time to train one kindle of kittens in the space ways before the next lot was born and the whole process began again. She couldn't actually remember many times when she had not been pregnant. It made patrolling the ventilation ducts and interior passages of her ship, the Molly Daise, a bit difficult at times, but there were always half-grown kittens to go into those few places where she could not fit her belly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Is that the truth? Well, I'll be. Could I pet her? Would she mind? She's such a pretty cat."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "I suppose it would be all right," Janina said, with a glance down at her.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The girl was already a bit more skittish than usual, and Chessie knew it was because she had opposed this latest pregnancy. Chessie couldn't agree more, but she graciously lifted her head to meet the man's fingers and felt Janina relax somewhat. The man had a gentle touch, and his fingers smelled pleasantly male and of a recent hearty meal. She gave the back of his hand a lick as he pulled it away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"What a darlin' girl," the man said, smiling at her. He had a very nice white smile that made his rugged face look younger. Chessie approved. He could probably snap a rat's neck with a single bite with teeth like those!&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Janina beamed. Chessie's young Cat Person took as much pride in Chessie and her babies as Chessie herself did. They had been together ten years, all of Chessie's life and over half of Janina's, who had been a mere human kitten when Chessie was born and the girl became hers. Some ships' cats considered their Cat Person to be a cross between a caretaker and a colleague. Chessie had thought of Janina as an older sister initially. But over the years, through her many litters, she had come to regard the girl almost as one of her own kittens. A grown kitten able to help with birthing the others, but still so young and in need of reassuring nuzzles and purrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I'm sorry, but I really need to keep moving," Janina told the man. "We're on our way to Dr. Vlast's clinic now for her prenatal checkup."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"A prenatal checkup for a cat? She must be really special," the man said, keeping pace alongside them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Chessie wanted a bath but couldn't start one while clasped in Janina's arms. The kittens were trying to pounce each other while still inside her, judging by the way it felt, and bouncing about the space station wasn't helping. She shifted her weight so her pretty fluffy tail draped over Janina's arm, making more room for her pretty fluffy rear. She mewed up at Kibble, as the rest of the crew called Janina. Apparently, a lot of Cat Persons on other ships had the same name, but Chessie was sure none of the others were as sweet and kind or took such good care of their Barque Cats as her Kibble did.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The man seemed to have appointed himself as their escort, walking easily beside them when the way was clear, breaking up clusters of thoughtlessly chattering people when it wasn't with a cheery, "Gangway! Pregnant lady coming through!"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Janina said, "Thank you. Poor Chessie and her kittens have such a great reputation, and fetch such a big price that she hasn't been given enough time to rest between litters, in my opinion. I want Dr. Vlast to check her over and make sure she's okay. I thought her previous litter should have been her last for a while but I was outvoted."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Chessie wished Janina had won. Motherhood had always been easy for her before, but this litter was disturbing. She dreamed of these kittens all the time-she couldn't remember doing that before. Or having the cravings she'd had with this pregnancy, like those deliciously crunchy shiny beetles she'd discovered in the last shipment of fresh fruit from Jambago Trine. She couldn't seem to get enough of them. Just thinking about them made her hungry.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Those kittens must be worth quite a bit for the crew to risk stressing out Mrs. Puss here like that."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Janina told him what the babies from Chessie's last litter had fetched-a price that made the man whistle in appreciation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"As much as that, eh? I knew that some of the Federated ships had cats, but I never knew they were so important, or that some were so much more special than others."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "Oh my, yes. Chessie and her kind have been specially bred for service on shipboard and have saved countless lives! Having the right cat is like having the right engineer, or the right navigator."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"That's amazing," the man said with the proper degree of awe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Chessie was amazed too. This man must be serving on very low-class ships not to know the importance of Barque Cats, to have missed the story of the founding of her breed and profession. The entire crew loved to tell the story, over the com or when getting together with the crews of other ships. A ship's Barque Cat was a great bragging point for the crew, especially since kittens from the most remarkable cats were highly prized and went to the best homes and earned the crews extra treats. Even Janina, who never preened herself, was apt to carry on at nap-inducing length about Chessie's ancestry, breeding, history, personal qualities, and job performance. Chessie liked it that her friends boasted about her, but there were limits!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Janina had become so nervous about taking her to see Dr. Vlast-as Chessie could tell from her rapid heartbeat-it was as if she was the one who would be poked and prodded and have a thermometer shoved up her bum. Since Dr. Vlast had taken over the clinic, Janina seemed much more concerned about her health than ever before. Since the arrival of the good-looking young vet, she and Janina usually visited the clinic several times at each docking, even if she felt perfectly well. This time, the girl seemed to be welcoming the distraction of being able to talk to the curious man about her favorite subject-Barque Cats in general and her in particular. Kibble launched enthusiastically into the familiar story as they made their way through the space station to the clinic.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Chessie's many times great-great-grandsire, Tuxedo Thomas, originally belonged to a lady named Mrs. Montgomery, the wife of Captain Mason Montgomery," Janina told the man. "She and Thomas lived on PS Station until she was killed in a ventilation accident. Thomas must have blamed himself for not preventing the death of his mistress, because when Captain Montgomery returned to the station, he found Thomas patrolling the ventilation ducts, apparently looking for leaks. Thomas didn't stop the behavior when the captain, out of respect for his wife's love of the cat, took him aboard his cargo ship, the SS Flamboyant."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I can see where the cat might have been a big help on cargo ships with foodstuffs," the man conceded. "Maybe keeping down the vermin, the rodents and bugs, but surely any cat could do that-and traps and sonic deterrents and other devices would serve the same purpose."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Hmph, Chessie thought...</p><h2>Dave Barry Does Japan</h2><p>The best-selling author of Dave Barry Talks Back provides a look at the follies and quirks of the Japanese--and Americans--in a collection of observations on sumo wrestling, sushi, geisha girls, and more. 150,000 first printing. $150,000 ad/promo.

He grows up and moves on, but he is forever changed by the cruel and brutal nature of the act. It lights a fire deep within him that burns white and cold, a quiet flame just waiting to ignite. Now, years later, the sins of his life are reaching into his present, bringing with them the buried secrets and half-forgotten acts of his past. <br> <br> Someone is hunting him, targeting his home, his businesses, and his partner, Angel. The instrument of revenge is Bliss, a killer of killers, the most feared of assassins. Bliss is a Reaper, a lethal tool to be applied toward the ultimate end, but he is also a man with a personal vendetta. <br> <br> Hardened by their pasts, Louis and Angel decide to strike back. While they form a camaraderie that brings them solace, it offers them no shelter from the fate that stalks them. When they mysteriously disappear, their friends are forced to band together to find them. They are led by private detective Charlie Parker, a killer himself, a Reaper in waiting. <br> <br> Connolly's triumphant prose and unerring rendering of his tortured characters mesmerize and chill. He creates a world where everyone is corrupt, murderers go unpunished, but betrayals are always avenged.

Some are obvious: the man who kills his girlfriend, then takes his own life, either out of remorse or because of his own inability to face the consequences of his actions; or the tit-for-tat murders of hoodlums, gangsters, drug dealers, each killing leading inexorably to another as the violence escalates. One death invites the next, extending a pale hand in greeting, grinning as the ax falls, the blade cuts. There is a chain of events that can easily be reconstructed, a clear trail for the law to follow.</p><p>But there are other killings that are harder to connect, the links between them obscured by great distances, by the passage of years, by the layering of this honeycomb world as time folds softly upon itself.</p><p>The honeycomb world does not hide secrets: it stores them. It is a repository of buried memories, of half-forgotten acts.</p><p>In the honeycomb world, everything is connected.<b></b></p><p><b>* * *</b></p><p>The St. Daniil sat on Brightwater Court, not far from the cavernous dinner clubs on Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue where couples of all ages danced to music in Russian, Spanish, and English, ate Russian food, shared vodka and wine, and watched stage shows that would not have been out of place in some of the more modest Reno hotels, or on a cruise ship, yet the St. Daniil was far enough away from them to render itself distinct in any number of ways. The building that it occupied overlooked the ocean, and the boardwalk with its principal trio of restaurants, the Volna, the Tatiana, and the Winter Garden, now screened to protect their patrons from the cool sea breeze and the stinging sands. Nearby was the Brighton playground, where, during the day, old men sat at stone tables playing cards while children cavorted nearby, the young and the not-so-young united together in the same space. New condos had sprung up to the east and west, part of the transformation that Brighton Beach had undergone in recent years.</p><p>But the St. Daniil belonged to an older dispensation, a different Brighton Beach, one occupied by the kind of businesses that made their money from those who were on nodding terms with poverty: check-cashing services that took 25 percent of every check cashed, then offered loans at a similar monthly rate to cover the shortfall; discount stores that sold cheap crockery with cracked glaze, and firetrap Christmas decorations all year round; former mom-and-pop grocery stores that were now run by the kind of men who looked like they might have the remains of mom and pop rotting in their cellars; laundromats frequented by men who smelt of the streets and who would routinely strip down to filthy shorts and sit, nearly naked, waiting for their clothes to wash before giving them a single desultory spin in the dryer (for every quarter counted) and then dress in the still-damp clothes, folding the rest into plastic garbage bags and venturing back onto the streets, their garments steaming slightly in the air; pawnshops that did a steady trade in redeemed and unredeemed items, for there was always someone willing to benefit from the misfortune of another; and storefronts with no name above the window and only a battered counter inside, the shadowy business conducted within of no interest to those who needed to be told its nature. Most of those places were gone now, relegated to side streets, to less desirable neighborhoods, pushed farther and farther back from the avenue and the sea, although those who needed their services would always know where to find them.</p><p>The St. Daniil remained, though. It endured. The St. Daniil was a club, although it was strictly private and had little in common with its glitzier counterparts on the avenue. Accessed through a steel-caged door, it occupied the basement of an old brownstone building surrounded by other brownstones of similar vintage although, while its neighbors had been cleaned up, the edifice occupied by the St. Daniil had not. It had once formed the main entrance to a larger complex, but changes to the internal structure of the buildings had isolated the St. Daniil between two significantly more attractive apartment blocks. The club's home now squatted in the middle of them like some poor relation that had muscled in on a family photo, unashamed of its ignominy.</p><p>Above the St. Daniil was a warren of small apartments, some big enough to be occupied by entire families, others small enough to accommodate only an individual, and one, at that, for whom space mattered less than privacy and anonymity. Nobody lived in those apartments now, not willingly. Some were used for storage: booze, cigarettes, electrical goods, assorted contraband. The rest acted as temporary quarters for young -- sometimes very young -- prostitutes and, when required, their clients. One or two of the rooms were marginally better furnished and maintained than others, and contained video cameras and recording equipment for the making of pornographic films.</p><p>Although it was known as the St. Daniil, the club did not have an official name. A plate beside the door read "Private Members Social Club" in English and Cyrillic, but it was not the kind of place where anyone went to be sociable. There was a bar there, but few lingered at it, and those who did stuck mostly to coff ee and killed time while waiting for errands to run, vig to collect, bones to break. A TV above the bar showed pirated DVDs, old hockey games, sometimes porn or, late at night, when all business had been conducted, film of Russian troops in Chechnya engaging in reprisals against their enemies, real or perceived. Worn hemispherical vinyl booths lined the walls, with scuff ed tables at their center, relics of a time when this really was a social club, a place where men could talk of the old country and share the newspapers that had arrived in the mail or in the suitcases of visitors and immigrants. The decor consisted mainly of framed copies of Soviet posters from the 1940s, bought for five bucks at RBC Video on Brighton Beach Avenue.</p><p>For a time, the police had kept watch on the club, but they had been unable to access it in order to plant a bug, and a wiretap on the phones had expired without anything useful being learned. Any business of consequence was, they suspected, now conducted on throwaway cellphones, the phones replaced religiously at the end of every week. Two raids by vice on the building through the doorway above the club had scored only a couple of johns and a handful of weary whores, few of whom had English and fewer of whom had papers. No pimps were ever apprehended, and the women, the cops knew, were easily replaced.</p><p>On those nights, the door to the St. Daniil had remained firmly closed, and when the cops finally gained entry to it they had found only a bored bartender and a pair of ancient, toothless Russians playing poker for matchsticks.</p><p>It was a mid-October evening. The light outside had long faded and only a single booth in the club was occupied. The man seated there was a Ukrainian known as the Priest. He had studied in an Orthodox seminary for three years before discovering his true vocation, which lay primarily in providing the kinds of services for which priests were usually required to off er forgiveness. The club's unofficial name was a testament to the Priest's brief flirtation with the religious life. The St. Daniil monastery was Moscow's oldest cloister, a stronghold of the Orthodox faith even during the worst excesses of the Communist era, when many of its priests had become martyrs and the remains of St. Daniil himself had been smuggled to America in order to save them from harm.</p><p>Unlike many of those who worked for him, the Priest spoke English with hardly a trace of an accent. He had been part of the first influx of immigrants from the Soviet Union, working hard to learn the ways of this new world, and he could still recall a time when Brighton Beach had been nothing but old people living in rent-controlled apartments surrounded by little vacant houses falling into decay, a far cry from the days when this area was a beacon for immigrants and New Yorkers alike anxious to leave the crowded neighborhoods of Brownsville, East New York, and Manhattan's Lower East Side for space in which to live and the feel of sea air in their lungs. He prided himself on his sophistication. He read the <i>Times</i>, not the Post. He went to the theater. When he was in his realm, there was no porn on the TV, no poorly copied DVDs. Instead, it was tuned to BBC World, or sometimes CNN. He did not like Fox News. It looked inward, and he was a man who was always looking at the greater world outside. He drank tea during the day, and only compote, a fruit punch that tasted of plums, at night. He was an ambitious man, a prince who wished to become a king. He paid obeisance to the old men, the ones who had been imprisoned under Stalin, the ones whose fathers had created the criminal enterprise that had now reached its zenith in a land far from their own. But even as he bowed before them, the Priest looked for ways in which they might be undermined. He calculated the strength of potential rivals among his own generation and prepared his people for the inevitable bloodshed, sanctioned or unsanctioned, that would come. Recently, there had been some reversals. The mistakes might have been avoided, but he was not entirely to blame for them. Unfortunately, there were others who did not see it that way. Perhaps, he thought, the bloodshed would have to begin sooner than expected.</p><p>Today had been a bad day, another in a succession of bad days. There had been a problem with the restrooms that morning and the place still stank, even though the diffi culty had apparently been solved once the drain people, from a fi rm trusted by the organization, got on the case. On another day, the Priest might well have left the club and gone elsewhere, but there was business to be conducted and loose ends to be tied...</p></p><h2>Cardcaptor Sakura: Master of the Clow, Book 1</h2><p>After retrieving all of the evil Clow Cards, fifth-grader Sakura, Master of the Clow, must now face the challenges sent by Clow Reed, the creator of the Clow Cards, while also dealing with her love for older student Yukito.</p><p>CLAMP is an all-female team and one of the hottest groups of manga creators in Japan today.

These demands are Jesus' way of showing us who he is and what he expects of us. They are not the harsh demands of a taskmaster. For example, the demand that we come to Jesus is like the demand of a father to his child in a burning window, "Jump to me!" Or like the demand of a rich, strong, tender, handsome husband to an unfaithful wife, "Come home!" What Jesus demands from the world can be summed up as: "Trust and treasure me above all." This is good news!</p> <p>In <em>What Jesus Demands from the World</em>, John Piper has gathered many of Jesus' demands from the four Gospels. He begins with an introduction that puts the demands in a redemptive-historical context, then concisely examines each demand. The result is an accessible introduction for thoughtful inquirers and new believers, as well as meditative meat for veteran believers who want to know Jesus better.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Piper</strong> (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org&nbsp;and the chancellor of Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary. He served for thirty-three years as the senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is the author of more than fifty books, including <em>Desiring God</em>;&nbsp;<em>Don&#x2019;t Waste Your Life</em>;&nbsp;<em>This Momentary Marriage</em>;&nbsp;<em>A Peculiar Glory</em>;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Reading the Bible Supernaturally</em>.</p><p>"The Christian gospel is more than just a wonderful offer of saving grace; it is a demand for supreme loyalty, for surrender to the lordship of Jesus. We forget this too easily in our contemporary church, besieged as we are by a philosophy of pluralism that rejects ultimate authority and a culture of rights that scorns submissiveness. But John Piper reminds us of the real truth: obedience to Christ's commands is our absolute duty; yet, paradoxically, in his service is perfect freedom and joy!"<br>&#x2014;<strong>William J.U. Phillip</strong>, Minister, St George's-Tron Church, Glasgow, Scotland, UK</p><p>"John Piper reveals in his 'Word to Biblical Scholars' his familiarity with the literature and subject matter of the life and teachings of Jesus, and in his comments on the individual demands of Jesus he applies them to everyday living."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Robert H. Stein</strong>, Senior Professor of New Testament Interpretation, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>"This is now my favorite book by John Piper. In the best tradition of Adolf Schlatter's Do We Know Jesus? and his 'hermeneutic of perception,' What Jesus Demands from the World has changed my life and will certainly change yours because it is based on the pure words of Jesus as revealed in the four Gospels. A must-read for every true follower of Christ."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Andreas J. Kostenberger</strong>, Senior Professor of New Testament and Biblical Theology, Director of Ph.D. Studies, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>"This book is a special gift from the pen of John Piper. How long has it been since you carefully reflected upon the authoritative commands of Christ? Through these pages you will encounter the Savior and experience the transforming effects of the gospel. Few endeavors are more worthy of your time."<br>&#x2014;<strong>C. J. Mahaney</strong><strong>,</strong> Sovereign Grace Ministries</p><p>"Scholars, popularists, and now even novelists are falling over each other today in a blind passion to discover an alternative Jesus to the One so magnificently portrayed in the biblical Gospels. In stark and refreshing contrast John Piper clear-sightedly grasps the obvious-the biblical Jesus is worth living for and dying for."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Sinclair B. Ferguson</strong>, Senior Pastor, First Presbyterian Church, Columbia, South Carolina</p><p>"This is a peculiar book. It assumes that the four Gospels are true and unified. It assumes that Jesus not only does things for us but also makes demands of us. And it assumes that Jesus has authority over everyone regardless of their religion, gender, race, income, sexuality, nationality, or culture. You will likely not agree with every point. But you will hear from a Jesus who is more than a soft-spoken, effeminate, marginalized, Galilean hippie-peasant in a dress and has the peculiar notion that he alone is Lord."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Mark Driscoll</strong><strong>,</strong> Founding Pastor, Mars Hill Church, Seattle; President, the Resurgence</p></p><h2>Emiliano Zapata!: Revolution and Betrayal in Mexico</h2><p><p>The life of Mexican Revolutionary Emiliano Zapata was the stuff that legends are made of. Born and raised in a tiny village in the small south-central state of Morelos, he led an uprising in 1911--one strand of the larger Mexican Revolution--against the regime of long-time president Porfirio D�az. He fought not to fulfill personal ambitions, but for the campesinos of Morelos, whose rights were being systematically ignored in Don Porfirio's courts.</p><p>Expanding haciendas had been appropriating land and water for centuries in the state, but as the twentieth century began things were becoming desperate. It was not long before D�az fell. But Zapata then discovered that other national leaders--Francisco Madero, Victoriano Huerta, and Venustiano Carranza--would not put things right, and so he fought them too. He fought for nearly a decade until, in 1919, he was gunned down in an ambush at the hacienda Chinameca.</p><p>In this new political biography of Zapata, Brunk, noted journalist and scholar, shows us Zapata the leader as opposed to Zapata the archetypal peasant revolutionary. In previous writings on Zapata, the movement is covered and Zapata the man gets lost in the shuffle. Brunk clearly demonstrates that Zapata's choices and actions did indeed have an historical impact.</p></p><p>This clearly written and carefully argued narrative presents a less mythical and more human Zapata against the dramatic and chaotic background of the Mexican Revolution.Samuel Brunk is associate professor of history, University of Texas, El Paso.</p><h2>How to Meet the Enemy (Macarthur Study Series)</h2><p>C.S. Lewis wrote: There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors, and hail a materialist or magician with the same delight (The Screwtape Letters [New York: Macmillan, 1961], p. 3). Lewis was right. Unfortunately, strands of both errors exist in today&#39;s church. On the one hand, some Christians are materialists who fail to understand that the Christian life is a fierce spiritual battle. One reason for a materialistic attitude is indifference. When your world is an easy place to live in, it&#39;s easy to forget that a spiritual war is going on. It&#39;s easy to forget that millions of souls in the world are in the grasp of Satan. And it&#39;s easy to forget that Satan always takes advantage of Christians who are lethargic, indolent, or spiritually stagnant. He loves it when Christians try to hole up in a sanctified environment instead of fighting the battle. Yet that is precisely the agenda of many churches today. People are trying desperately to enjoy fellowship while remaining indifferent to the battle. Another reason for being materialistic is worldliness. Too many Christians crave earthly, temporal pleasures instead of the rigors of warfare. They seek a life of ease�a life of entertainment and activities, never realizing their role in the battle of the ages. A believer who invests his or her time and resources in mundane things won&#39;t understand spiritual warfare. A Christian who had a deficient view of God&#39;s grace said to me, &#34;The wonderful thing about the Christian life is that basically you can do whatever you want.&#34; Believers are not handed a free pass to do what they want. They are called to obey Christ, the Commander-in-Chief. In Matthew 16:24-25, Jesus raised this call: &#34;If any one wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake shall find it.&#34; We can&#39;t let spiritual warfare rage around us without joining the fight. It&#39;s vital that we take spiritual inventory by asking, Am I making a difference in the fight? Too many will settle for indifference and worldliness. Satan has a heyday with such Christians. My prayer is that your devotion and commitment level will deepen when you understand how to meet the enemy. On the other hand, there are also many in today&#39;s church who have an excessive and unhealthy fascination with demons. The following article, which appeared in the Los Angeles Times, illustrates this obsession: Under the militant banner of &#34;spiritual warfare,&#34; growing numbers of evangelical and charismatic Christian leaders are preparing broad assaults on what they call the cosmic powers of darkness. Fascinated with the notion that Satan commands a hierarchy of territorial demons, some mission agencies and big-church pastors are devising strategies for &#34;breaking the strongholds&#34; of those evil spirits alleged to be controlling cities and countries. Some proponents in the fledgling movement already maintain that focused prayer meetings have ended the curse of the Bermuda triangle, led to the 1987 downfall in Oregon of free-love guru Baghwan Shree Rajneesh, and for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, produced a two-week drop in the crime rate, a friendly atmosphere and unclogged freeways. This is not the cinematic story line for a religious sequel to &#34;Ghostbusters II,&#34; yet the developing scenario does have a fictional influence: interest in spiritual warfare has been heightened by two best-selling novels in Christian bookstores. &#34;This Present Darkness,&#34; by Frank Peretti, describes the religious fight against &#34;territorial spirits mobilized to dominate a small town.&#34; A second Peretti novel has a similar premise. Fuller Seminary Prof. C. Peter Wagner, who has written extensively on the subject, led a &#34;summit&#34; meeting on cosmic-level spiritual warfare Monday in Pasadena with two dozen men and women, including a Texas couple heading a group called the &#34;Generals of Intercession&#34; and an Oregon man who conducts &#34;spiritual warfare bootcamps&#34; (John Dart, &#34;Evangelicals, Charismatics Prepare for Spiritual Warfare,&#34; 17 February 1990, F16).More and more Christian leaders seem to be championing such efforts. I know of a large conservative mission organization that is requiring all its missionaries to attend special training seminars to learn how to confront and assault the powers of darkness. Their strategy includes speaking to demons and learning techniques for exorcising them. It is becoming very popular to deliver incantations against Satan and supposedly rebuke or bind him. What about this fascination? Do believers need to attend spiritual warfare bootcamps? Are we to break the stronghold of demons so we can regain cities and countries? Should believers speak to demons and cast them out? Can we actually bind and rebuke Satan? Certainly Christians are engaged in a struggle against the powers of darkness, for in Ephesians 6:12, Paul said, &#34;Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.&#34;Many of the practices of today&#39;s spiritual warfare movement, however, are in stark contrast to the clear teaching of God&#39;s Word. Dr. Archibald Alexander, the first professor of Princeton Seminary and a brilliant theologian, wrote: There is nothing more necessary than to distinguish carefully between true and false experiences in religion; to &#34;tiy the spirits whether they are of God.&#34; And in making this discrimination, there is no other test but the infallible Word of God; let every thought, motive, impulse, and emotion be brought to this touchstone. &#34;To the law and the testimony; if they speak not according to these, it is because there is no light in them&#34; (Thoughts on Religious Experience [Carlisle, Penn.: The Banner of Truth Trust, 1978], p. xviii).God&#39;s Word must be our only guide for all we believe and practice. Let&#39;s examine what Scripture says about spiritual warfare in contrast to the beliefs, practices, and experiences of those in today&#39;s spiritual warfare movement.</p><p></p><h2>Brotherhood of War: The Lieutenants, the Captains, the Majors - 3 Complete Novels</h2><p>Hailed by Tom Clancy as &#34;an American epic,&#34; the Brotherhood of War series is a sweeping military saga that probes the hearts and minds of those who fight our nation&#39;s wars.

Meticulously detailed illustrations capture each bird's distinctive physicality and temperament. A Burrowing Owl faces you in a full-on head shot, perhaps having just raised its raspy, chattering alarm call as you trespass on its last remaining Bay Area foothold at the Marina. The Anna's Hummingbird gives you a coy backward glance to assess if you've properly admired its flashy throat feathers, maybe having just performed its signature J-shaped courtship dive. Even in composition, each bird is strikingly individual, whether depicted in mid-dive or creeping into frame. While descriptions of identification and vocalizations are straightforward, author-illustrator Oliver James takes a delightfully creative approach to his write-ups of each species. He invites you to imagine that a Cooper's Hawk, for example, is Steve McQueen in a '68 Mustang, and you, &#x201c;a pigeon in a rental car with a poor turning radius,&#x201d; are fleeing through traffic: &#x201c;It's all over in a matter of seconds.&#x201d; A joy to read and pore over,&nbsp;<i>Birds of Berkeley</i>&nbsp;will enchant readers far beyond the city limits with its findings gleaned from painstaking and patient wildlife observation.</p><p>Oliver James was born in Berkeley in 1991.

It&#39;s realizing that God meets us not in a monastery but on Main Street, and that all of ordinary, daily life has the potential to be lived as if Jesus himself were the one living it. Now expanded to include an added chapter on prayer and discussion questions designed to help small groups make the journey together, The Life You&#39;ve Always Wanted offers modern perspectives on the ancient path of the spiritual disciplines. But this is more than just a book about things we should do if we want to be good Christians. It&#39;s a road map toward true transformation, compelling because it starts not with ourselves but with the object of our journey---Jesus Christ. Paved with humor and sparkling anecdotes, The Life You&#39;ve Always Wanted is an encouraging and challenging approach to a Christian life that&#39;s worth living. Life on the edge that fills our ordinary world with new meaning, hope, change, and a joyous, growing closeness to Christ.</p><p>John Ortberg is a pastor at Menlo Park Presbyterian Church in Menlo Park, California.

SoREN KIERKEGAARD I could not quiet that pearly ache in my heart that I diagnosed as the cry of home. PAT CONROY I am disappointed with myself. I am disappointed not so much with particular things I have done as with aspects of who I have become. I have a nagging sense that all is not as it should be. Some of this disappointment is trivial. I wouldn&#39;t have minded getting a more muscular physique. I can&#39;t do basic home repairs. So far I haven&#39;t shown much financial wizardry. Some of this disappointment is neurotic. Sometimes I am too concerned about what others think of me, even people I don&#39;t know. Some of this disappointment, I know, is worse than trivial; it is simply the sour fruit of self-absorption. I attend a high school reunion and can&#39;t choke back the desire to stand out by looking more attractive or having achieved more impressive accomplishments than my classmates. I speak to someone with whom I want to be charming, and my words come out awkward and pedestrian. I am disappointed in my ordinariness. I want to be, in the words of Garrison Keillor, named &#39;Sun-God, King of America, Idol of Millions, Bringer of Fire, The Great Haji, Thun-Dar the Boy Giant.&#39; But some of this disappointment in myself runs deeper. When I look in on my children as they sleep at night, I think of the kind of father I want to be. I want to create moments of magic, I want them to remember laughing until the tears flow, I want to read to them and make the books come alive so they love to read, I want to have slow, sweet talks with them as they&#39;re getting ready to close their eyes, I want to sing them awake in the morning. I want to chase fireflies with them, teach them to play tennis, have food fights, and hold them and pray for them in a way that makes them feel cherished. I look in on them as they sleep at night, and I remember how the day really went: I remember how they were trapped in a fight over checkers and I walked out of the room because I didn&#39;t want to spend the energy needed to teach them how to resolve conflict. I remember how my daughter spilled cherry punch at dinner and I yelled at her about being careful as if she&#39;d revealed some deep character flaw; I yelled at her even though I spill things all the time and no one yells at me; I yelled at her---to tell the truth---simply because I&#39;m big and she&#39;s little and I can get away with it. And then I saw that look of hurt and confusion in her eyes, and I knew there was a tiny wound on her heart that I had put there, and I wished I could have taken those sixty seconds back. I remember how at night I didn&#39;t have slow, sweet talks, but merely rushed the children to bed so I could have more time to myself. I&#39;m disappointed. And it&#39;s not just my life as a father. I am disappointed also for my life as a husband, friend, neighbor, and human being in general. I think of the day I was born, when I carried the gift of promise, the gift given to all babies. I think of that little baby and what might have been: the ways I might have developed mind and body and spirit, the thoughts I might have had, the joy I might have created. I am disappointed that I still love God so little and sin so much. I always had the idea as a child that adults were pretty much the people they wanted to be. Yet the truth is, I am embarrassingly sinful. I am capable of dismaying amounts of jealousy if someone succeeds more visibly than I do. I am disappointed at my capacity to be small and petty. I cannot pray for very long without my mind drifting into a fantasy of angry revenge over some past slight I thought I had long since forgiven or some grandiose fantasy of achievement. I can convince people I&#39;m busy and productive and yet waste large amounts of time watching television. These are just some of the disappointments. I have other ones, darker ones, that I&#39;m not ready to commit to paper. The truth is, even to write these words is a little misleading, because it makes me sound more sensitive to my fallenness than I really am. Sometimes, although I am aware of how far I fall short, it doesn&#39;t even bother me very much. And I am disappointed at my lack of disappointment. Where does this disappointment come from? A common answer in our day is that it is a lack of self-esteem, a failure to accept oneself. That may be part of the answer, but it is not the whole of it, not by a long shot. The older and wiser answer is that the feeling of disappointment is not the problem, but a reflection of a deeper problem---my failure to be the person God had in mind when he created me. It is the &#39;pearly ache&#39; in my heart to be at home with the Father. Universal Disappointment One of the most profound statements I have heard about the human condition was one I first encountered when I was only five years old. It was spoken by my hero, Popeye the Sailor Man. When he was frustrated or wasn&#39;t sure what to do or felt inadequate, Popeye would simply say, &#39;I yam what I yam.&#39;</p><h2>Pumping Apparatus: Driver Operator&#39;s Handbook</h2><p>This second edition of the Pumping Apparatus Driver/Operator Handbook is designed to educate driver/operators who are responsible for operating apparatus equipped with fire pumps. The information in this manual aids the driver/operator in meeting the objectives found in Chapters 1, 4, 5, 8 and 10 of NFPA 1002, Standard for Fire Apparatus Driver/Operator Professional Qualifications (2003 edition). The information contained in this new edition is intended to update that in the first edition of the manual. The first edition incorporated material that was previously found in three separate IFSTA manuals: Fire Department Pumping Apparatus, Fire Stream Practices, and Water Supplies for Fire Protection. The purpose of this manual is to present general principles of pump operation, along with the application of those principles wherever feasible. It is also meant to guide driver/operators in the proper operation and care of apparatus. This manual includes an overview of the qualities and skills needed by a driver/operator, safe driving techniques, types of pumping apparatus, positioning apparatus to maximize efficiency and water supply, fire pump theory and operation, hydraulic calculations, water supply considerations, relay pumping principles, water shuttle procedures, foam system operation, and apparatus maintenance and testing.</p><p></p><h2>Citizen Hearst: A Biography of William Randolph Hearst</h2><p>William Hearst, a very controversial figure holding an enormous zest for life, lived an extraordinary life of millionaire, newspaper tycoon, and politician</p><p></p><h2>The Frugal Gourmet Celebrates Christmas</h2><p>Celebrates the season with traditional treats, as well as dishes from other countries</p><p></p><h2>Stone of Tymora: Forgotten Realms</h2><p><b>Praise for <i>Stone of Tymora</i>:</b><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;This fast-paced fantasy . . . is a perfect pick for . . . readers seeking powerful characterization and complex, fast-changing stories.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Midwest Book Review</i><br>&#x201c;[T]he lucidly described action and swift pace will keep the pages turning and anticipation of further adventures simmering.&#x201d; &#x2014;Booklist<br>&#x201c;The pace never falters, the cast is positively festooned with pirates and menacing magical creatures (such characters from parallel stories as Drizzt Do'Urden the Dark Elf also put in appearances) and Maimun's narrative ends on a cliffhanger that will leave readers slavering for the next episode.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus </i><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Overview: </b><br>Meet Maimun&#x2014;an orphan who couldn&#x2019;t imagine how unfortunate it would be to discover a stone that makes him forever lucky.

But perhaps it is the everyday places around us&#x2014;the cities we live in&#x2014;that need to be rediscovered. What does it feel like to find the city&#x2019;s edge, to explore its forgotten tunnels and scale unfinished skyscrapers high above the metropolis? <i>Explore Everything</i> reclaims the city, recasting it as a place for endless adventure.<br><br>Plotting expeditions from London, Paris, Berlin, Detroit, Chicago, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, Bradley L. Garrett has evaded urban security in order to experience the city in ways beyond the boundaries of conventional life. He calls it &#x2018;place hacking&#x2019;: the recoding of closed, secret, hidden and forgotten urban space to make them realms of opportunity.<br><br><i>Explore Everything </i>is an account of the author&#x2019;s escapades with the London Consolidation Crew, an urban exploration collective.<br><br>The book is also a manifesto, combining philosophy, politics and adventure, on our rights to the city and how to understand the twenty-first century metropolis.</p><p>Bradley L Garrett is a writer, photographer and researcher in the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford. After studying&nbsp;anthropology&nbsp;at the University of California, Riverside and working in Australia, Mexico and Hawaii as an archaeologist,&nbsp;Brad became an urban explorer, photographing off-limits urban spaces in the UK, Europe and America. His exploits have been featured in GQ Magazine, the Guardian, the Red Bulletin, and on TV and radio around the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Details of his recent research and media projects and a list of current publications can be found at <b>www.bradleygarrett.com.&nbsp;<br></b>*Starred Review* &#x201c;Dr. Garrett?&#x201d; asked the British police officer who boarded the plane as soon as it landed at Heathrow. The American-expat Oxford researcher was about to be arrested for his trespassing exploits. He meant no harm. Quite the opposite. Garrett and his fellow urban explorers celebrate forgotten places and protest limits on access. In this unique and electrifying travelogue, Garrett, a scholar with a background in anthropology and archeology, thoughtfully explicates their dangerous, exhilarating, and illegal explorations. We picture hackers as loners slouched anemically in the sickly light of a computer screen, but Garrett and his fellow travelers are as fit, agile, and fearless as ninja. Sharing an ethos with street artists, their mission is to &#x201c;exploit fractures in the architecture of the city in an effort to find deeper meaning in the spaces we pass through every day.&#x201d; Garrett recounts death-defying adventures in the UK, Europe, and the U.S. and shares his astonishingly dramatic photographs. Not only do place-hackers explore and document such urban ruins as abandoned factories, hospitals, and power stations; they also breach security systems to stand on the roofs of skyscrapers and tramp through sewer and subway systems. Each journey involves deep research, high risk, and profound intent. And wherever they go, they leave a sticker that reads, &#x201c;Explore everything.&#x201d; --Donna Seaman</p><h2>How to Hear Your Angels</h2><p><p><i>How to Hear Your Angels</i> is a step-by-step manual on how to clearly receive messages from your angels and guides.

This was many years ago now, but at night Tommy still sometimes woke with the fear he had felt the night his dairy farm burned to the ground. The house had burned to the ground as well; the wind had sent sparks onto the house, which was not far from the barns. It had been his fault&#x2014;�he always thought it was his fault&#x2014;�because he had not checked that night on the milking machines to make sure they had been turned off properly, and this is where the fire started. Once it started, it ripped with a fury over the whole place. They lost everything, except for the brass frame to the living room mirror, which he came upon in the rubble the next day, and he left it where it was. A collection was taken up: For a number of weeks his kids went to school in the clothes of their classmates, until he could gather himself and the little money he had; he sold the land to the neighboring farmer, but it did not bring much money in. Then he and his wife, a short pretty woman named Shirley, bought new clothes, and he bought a house as well, Shirley keeping her spirits up admirably as all this was going on. They&#x2019;d had to buy a house in Amgash, which was a run-�down town, and his kids went to school there instead of in Carlisle, where they had been able to go to school before, his farm being just on the line dividing the two towns. Tommy took a job as the janitor in the Amgash school system; the steadiness of the job appealed to him, and he could never go to work on someone else&#x2019;s farm, he did not have the stomach for that. He was thirty-�five years old at the time.<br><br>The kids were grown now, with kids of their own who were also grown, and he and Shirley still lived in their small house; she had planted flowers around it, which was unusual in that town. Tommy had worried a good deal about his children at the time of the fire; they had gone from having their home be a place that class trips came to&#x2014;�each year in spring the fifth-�grade class from Carlisle would make a day of it, eating their lunches out beside the barns on the wooden tables there, then tromping through the barns watching the men milking the cows, the white foamy stuff going up and over them in the clear plastic pipes&#x2014;�to having to see their father as the man who pushed the broom over the &#x201c;magic dust&#x201d; that got tossed over the throw-�up of some kid who had been sick in the hallways, Tommy wearing his gray pants and a white shirt that had Tommy stitched on it in red.<br><br>Well. They had all lived through it.<br><br>This morning Tommy drove slowly to the town of Carlisle for errands; it was a sunny Saturday in May, and his wife&#x2019;s eighty-�second birthday was just a few days away. All around him were open fields, the corn newly planted, and the soybeans too. A number of fields were still brown, as they&#x2019;d been plowed under for their planting, but mostly there was the high blue sky, with a few white clouds scattered near the horizon. He drove past the sign on the road that led down to the Barton home; it still said SEWING AND ALTERATIONS, even though the woman, Lydia Barton, who did the sewing and alterations had died many years ago. The Barton family had been outcasts, even in a town like Amgash, their extreme poverty and strangeness making this so. The oldest child, a man named Pete, lived alone there now, the middle child was two towns away, and the youngest, Lucy Barton, had fled many years ago, and had ended up living in New York City. Tommy had spent time thinking of Lucy. All those years she had lingered after school, alone in a classroom, from fourth grade right up to her senior year in high school; it had taken her a few years to even look him in the eye.<br><br>But now Tommy was driving past the area where his farm had been&#x2014;�these days it was all fields, not a sign of the farm was left&#x2014;�and he thought, as he often thought, about his life back then. It had been a good life, but he did not regret the things that had happened. It was not Tommy&#x2019;s nature to regret things, and on the night of the fire&#x2014;�in the midst of his galloping fear&#x2014;�he understood that all that mattered in this world were his wife and his children, and he thought that people lived their whole lives not knowing this as sharply and constantly as he did. Privately, he thought of the fire as a sign from God to keep this gift tightly to him. Privately, because he did not want to be thought of as a man who made up excuses for a tragedy; and he did not want anyone&#x2014;�not even his dearly beloved wife&#x2014;�to think he would do this. But he had felt that night, while his wife kept the children over by the road&#x2014;�he had rushed them from the house when he saw that the barn was on fire&#x2014;�as he watched the enormous flames flying into the nighttime sky, then heard the terrible screaming sounds of the cows as they died, he had felt many things, but it was just as the roof of his house crashed in, fell into the house itself, right into their bedrooms and the living room below with all the photos of the children and his parents, as he saw this happen he had felt&#x2014;�undeniably&#x2014;�what he could only think was the presence of God, and he understood why angels had always been portrayed as having wings, because there had been a sensation of that&#x2014;�of a rushing sound, or not even a sound, and then it was as though God, who had no face, but was God, pressed up against him and conveyed to him without words&#x2014;�so briefly, so fleetingly&#x2014;�some message that Tommy understood to be: It&#x2019;s all right, Tommy. And then Tommy had understood that it was all right. It was beyond his understanding, but it was all right. And it had been. He often thought that his children had become more compassionate as a result of having to go to school with kids who were poor, and not from homes like the one they had first known. He had felt the presence of God since, at times, as though a golden color was very near to him, but he never again felt visited by God as he had felt that night, and he knew too well what people would make of it, and this is why he would keep it to himself until his dying day&#x2014;�the sign from God.<br><br>Still, on a spring morning as this one was, the smell of the soil brought back to him the smells of the cows, the moisture of their nostrils, the warmth of their bellies, and his barns&#x2014;�he had had two barns&#x2014;�and he let his mind roll over pieces of scenes that came to him. Perhaps because he had just passed the Barton place he thought of the man, Ken Barton, who had been the father of those poor, sad children, and who had worked on and off for Tommy, and then he thought&#x2014;�as he more often did&#x2014;�of Lucy, who had left for college and then ended up in New York City. She had become a writer.<br><br>Lucy Barton.<br><br>Driving, Tommy shook his head slightly. Tommy knew many things as a result of being the janitor in that school more than thirty years; he knew of girls&#x2019; pregnancies and drunken mothers and cheating spouses, for he overheard these things talked about by the students in their small huddles by the bathrooms, or near the cafeteria; in many ways he was invisible, he understood that. But Lucy Barton had troubled him the most. She and her sister, Vicky, and her brother, Pete, had been viciously scorned by the other kids, and by some of the teachers too. Yet because Lucy stayed after school so often for so many years he felt&#x2014;�though she seldom spoke&#x2014;�that he knew her the best. One time when she was in the fourth grade, it was his first year working there, he had opened the door to a classroom and found her lying on three chairs pushed together, over near the radiators, her coat as a blanket, fast asleep. He had stared at her, watching her chest move slightly up and down, seen the dark circles beneath her eyes, her eyelashes spread like tiny twinkling stars, for her eyelids had been moist as though she had been weeping before she slept, and then he backed out slowly, quietly as he could; it had felt almost unseemly to come upon her like that.<br><br>But one time&#x2014;�he remembered this now&#x2014;�she must have been in junior high school, and he&#x2019;d walked into the classroom and she was drawing on the blackboard with chalk. She stopped as soon as he stepped inside the room. &#x201c;You go ahead,&#x201d; he said. On the board was a drawing of a vine with many small leaves. Lucy moved away from the blackboard, then she suddenly spoke to him. &#x201c;I broke the chalk,&#x201d; she said. Tommy told her that was fine. &#x201c;I did it on purpose,&#x201d; she said, and there was a tiny glint of a smile before she looked away. &#x201c;On purpose?&#x201d; he asked, and she nodded, again with the tiny smile. So he went and picked up a piece of chalk, a full stick of it, and he snapped it in half and winked at her. In his memory she had almost giggled. &#x201c;You drew that?&#x201d; he asked, pointing to the vine with the small leaves. And she shrugged then and turned away. But usually, she was just sitting at a desk and reading, or doing her homework, he could see that she was doing that.<br><br>He pulled up to a stop sign now, and said the words aloud to himself quietly, &#x201c;Lucy, Lucy, Lucy B. Where did you go to, how did you flee?&#x201d;<br><br>He knew how. In the spring of her senior year, he had seen her in the hallway after school, and she had said to him, so suddenly open-�faced, her eyes big, &#x201c;Mr. Guptill, I&#x2019;m going to college!&#x201d; And he had said, &#x201c;Oh, Lucy. That&#x2019;s wonderful.&#x201d; She had thrown her arms around him; she would not let go, and so he hugged her back. He always remembered that hug, because she had been so thin; he could feel her bones and her small breasts, and because he wondered later how much&#x2014;�how little&#x2014;�that girl had ever been hugged.<br><br>Tommy pulled away from the stop sign and drove into the town; right there beyond was a parking space. Tommy pulled in to it, got out of his car, and squinted in the sunshine. &#x201c;Tommy Guptill,&#x201d; shouted a man, and, turning, Tommy saw Griff Johnson walking toward him with his characteristic limp, for Griff had one leg that was shorter than the other, and even his built-�up shoe could not keep him from limping. Griff had an arm out, ready to shake hands. &#x201c;Griffith,&#x201d; said Tommy, and they pumped their arms for a long time, while cars drove slowly past them down Main Street. Griff was the insurance man here in town, and he had been awfully good to Tommy; learning that Tommy had not insured his farm for its worth, Griff had said, &#x201c;I met you too late,&#x201d; which was true. But Griff, with his warm face, and big belly now, continued to be good to Tommy. In fact, Tommy did not know anyone&#x2014;�he thought&#x2014;�who was not good to him. As a breeze moved around them, they spoke of their children and grandchildren; Griff had a grandson who was on drugs, which Tommy thought was very sad, and he just listened and nodded, glancing up at the trees that lined Main Street, their leaves so young and bright green, and then he listened about another grandson who was in medical school now, and Tommy said, &#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s just great, good for him,&#x201d; and they clapped hands on each other&#x2019;s shoulders and moved on.<br><br>In the dress shop, with its bell that announced his entrance, was Marilyn Macauley, trying on a dress. &#x201c;Tommy, what brings you in here?&#x201d; Marilyn was thinking of getting the dress for her granddaughter&#x2019;s baptism a few Sundays from now, she said, and she tugged on the side of it; it was beige with swirling red roses; she was without her shoes, standing in just her stockings. She said that it was an extravagance to buy a new dress for such a thing, but that she felt like it. Tommy&#x2014;�who had known Marilyn for years, first when she was in high school as a student in Amgash&#x2014;�saw her embarrassment, and he said he didn&#x2019;t think it was an extravagance at all. Then he said, &#x201c;When you have a chance, Marilyn, can you help me find something for my wife?&#x201d; He saw her become efficient then, and she said yes, she certainly would, and she went into the changing room and came back out in her regular clothes, a black skirt and a blue sweater, with her flat black shoes on, and right away she took Tommy over to the scarves. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she said, pulling out a red scarf that had a design with gold threads running through it. Tommy held it, but picked up a flowery scarf with his other hand. &#x201c;Maybe this,&#x201d; he said. And Marilyn said, &#x201c;Yes, that looks like Shirley,&#x201d; and then Tommy understood that Marilyn liked the red scarf herself but would never allow herself to buy it. Marilyn, that first year Tommy worked as a janitor, had been a lovely girl, saying &#x201c;Hi, Mr. Guptill!&#x201d; whenever she saw him, and now she had become an older woman, nervous, thin, her face pinched. Tommy thought what other people thought, it was because her husband had been in Vietnam and had never afterward been the same; Tommy would see Charlie Macauley around town, and he always looked so far away, the poor man, and poor Marilyn too. So Tommy held the red scarf with the gold threads for a minute as though considering it, then said, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re right, this one looks more like Shirley,&#x201d; and took the flowery one to the register. He thanked Marilyn for her help.<br><br>&#x201c;I think she&#x2019;ll love it,&#x201d; Marilyn said, and Tommy said he was sure she would.</p><h2>Codex: Necrons (Warhammer 40,000)</h2><p>Welcome, mortal, to the pages of this most forbidden tome, a blasphemous text that will guide you down the path of collecting, painting and gaming with the Necrons int he Warhammer 40,000 game. <br><br> The backbone of the Necron army is comprised of metallic, skeletal warriors that never truly die.

The era was one of unprecedented authoritarianism: England, it seemed, had become a police state, fearful of threats from abroad and plotters at home. This age of terror was also the era of the greatest creative genius the world has ever known: William Shakespeare. How, then, could such a remarkable man born into such violently volatile times apparently make no comment about the state of England in his work?<p> He did. But it was hidden. Revealing Shakespeare's sophisticated version of a forgotten code developed by 16th-century dissidents, Clare Asquith shows how he was both a genius for all time and utterly a creature of his own era: a writer who was supported by dissident Catholic aristocrats, who agonized about the fate of England's spiritual and political life and who used the stage to attack and expose a regime which he believed had seized illegal control of the country he loved.</p><p> Shakespeare's plays offer an acute insight into the politics and personalities of his era. And Clare Asquith's decoding of them offers answers to several mysteries surrounding Shakespeare's own life, including most notably why he stopped writing while still at the height of his powers. An utterly compelling combination of literary detection and political revelation, <b>Shadowplay</b> is the definitive expose of how Shakespeare lived through and understood the agonies of his time, and what he had to say about them.</p></p><p><b>Clare Asquith</b> has lectured on Shakespeare in England and Canada. Her article on <i>The Phoenix and the Turtle</i> was published in 2001 by the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, and her essay on <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i> appeared this year in Shakespeare and the <i>Culture of Christianity</i> in Early Modern England. She lives in London.Few masterpieces contain as many chestnuts as Hamlet. Take this one: "The play's the thing/ Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King." With these words, Prince Hamlet welcomes a theatrical troupe whose performance will unmask adultery and regicide in the Danish court.<p> Aphorisms wither faster than cut flowers, but sometimes old saws reveal new truths. Long before these lines became shopworn, they hinted at Shakespeare's modus operandi: In Shadowplay, Clare Asquith argues that the bard was using the theater of his day just as Hamlet did -- to send dangerous, skillfully encoded messages to his audience and his monarch. Hence, she writes, "it took not only intellectual brilliance but exceptional courage and constancy" to create and perform the greatest plays ever written.</p><p> Asquith is surfing an intriguing new wave of research: Shakespeare, it goes, was a closet Catholic at a time when the Church was banned. And far from presiding over the Golden Age, Queen Elizabeth I was running a police state, marked by raids, seizures, imprisonment and grisly executions, where informants snitched on private citizens. The court of her successor, James I, was worse.</p><p> Shakespeare's plays, Asquith suggests, encouraged patience and perseverance among the beleaguered Catholics and urged England's rulers to curtail the frequent crackdowns and persecutions.</p><p> What we do know: Shakespeare's Stratford was a center of religious resistance to the "new religion"; his father left a written testament of his enduring Catholic faith; Shakespeare's daughter, Susannah, was a "recusant," charged with refusing to attend Protestant services. The Ardens, Shakespeare's mother's family, were staunch Catholics whose chieftain, Edward Arden, was executed for his beliefs in 1583 by the usual method (he was dragged on a hurdle behind horses, then hanged, cut down alive, disemboweled and castrated before his heart was cut out).</p><p> Shakespeare was famously private about his life and habits -- as were many Catholics anxious to conceal their recusancy and attendance at illegal masses. But does that suggest he was Catholic? Asquith points out that most Elizabethans were, up until the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The line was a murky Neverland -- some "Catholics" hid priests, risking their lives; others complied publicly, merely remaining "Catholic" at heart. Catholic playwrights took huge chances, dropping hints and references in their scripts. Asquith isn't the first to fish in these waters, of course. Scholars have been poring over Shakespeare's plays for decades, trying to find clues about his attitude towards his times. </p><p>But Asquith is no nitpicking professor. She's not afraid to wing it. By taking unscholarly chances, she may have unlocked a door. We may have been looking at the plays with a microscope, hunting for political comment in the odd line or two, when what we really needed was a wide-angle lens.</p><p>For example, in "King Lear," two sisters, motivated by material gain, falsely promise that they will give all their love to their father. Their honest sister is exiled for saying she must divide her love for her father with the obedience she will owe her husband. Significantly, religious dissidents at that time were refusing to pledge fealty to King James over their faith and the pope. Similarly, when Elizabethan audiences watched Laertes protest the brief obsequies given his sister Ophelia, they knew that Catholics were furtively burying their loved ones with the old rites, while publicly holding fake burials with the "maimed rites." Violent quarrels sometimes erupted in churches, and zealous Protestants exhumed bodies in the night.</p><p> That said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and some of Asquith's "markers" are farfetched. It's possible, as she suggests, that Shakespeare's tall, fair heroines represent the Catholic ideals, and the short, swarthy ones represent Protestant principles. But it's even more likely that Shakespeare really did have a dark mistress who influenced his poems and plays. And likely, too, that he was acknowledging contemporary fashions and pandering to a fair, redheaded (and notoriously vain) queen. Such sweeping conjectures detract from the merits of Shadowplay.</p><p> Asquith claims that Shakespeare did not retire quietly to Stratford in 1610 -- he was silenced. She links his sudden disappearance with the shockwaves created by the assassination of Henry IV of France. That king was a champion of tolerance who was murdered by a mad friar. Within a few years, all the major playwrights of the time had quit the theater, with the noteworthy exception of Ben Jonson, who publicly renounced Catholicism in 1610. They drifted back in the 1620s, but by that time, Shakespeare was dead -- and England was irrevocably Protestant.</p><p> Asquith smashes the familiar icon of Shakespeare as a determined conformist who brilliantly skated the political thin ice that cracked under his less skillful countrymen. Her Shakespeare is darker and more complex -- a tormented dissident who died in defeat. Asquith is far from alone in her conjectures. The portrait that is emerging shows that Shakespeare was a hero as magnificent as any he created. </p><p>Reviewed by Cynthia L. Haven <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

It focuses on such subjects as John Wayne and Howard Hughes, growing up a girl in California, ruminating on the nature of good and evil in a Death Valley motel room, and, especially, the essence of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, the heart of the counterculture.</p><p>Upon its publication in 1968, Slouching Towards Bethlehem confirmed Joan Didion as one of the most prominent writers on the literary scene. Her unblinking vision and deadpan tone have influenced subsequent generations of reporters and essayists, changing our expectations of style, voice, and the artistic possibilities of nonfiction. <br>"In her portraits of people," "The New York Times Book Review wrote, "Didion is not out to expose but to understand, and she shows us actors and millionaires, doomed brides and naive acid-trippers, left-wing ideologues and snobs of the Hawaiian aristocracy in a way that makes them neither villainous nor glamorous, but alive and botched and often mournfully beautiful. . . . A rare display of some of the best prose written today in this country." <br>In essay after essay, Didion captures the dislocation of the 1960s, the disorientation of a country shredding itself apart with social change. Her essays not only describe the subject at hand--the murderous housewife, the little girl trailing the rock group, the millionaire bunkered in his mansion--but also offer a broader vision of America, one that is both terrifying and tender, ominous and uniquely her own. <br>Joyce Carol Oates has written, "Joan Didion is one of the very few writers of our time who approaches her terrible subject with absolute seriousness, with fear and humility and awe. Her powerful irony is often sorrowful rather than clever. . . . She has been an articulate witness to the most stubborn and intractable truths of our time, a memorable voice, partly eulogistic, partly despairing; always in control.""A slant vision that is arresting and unique . . .

All of the windows in our tiny apartment looked onto its blandness, and despite today&#x2019;s beautiful weather, it was dark inside. So very different from my childhood home, Atlantis, on the shores of Lake Geneva.<br> <br>I realized I had been seated exactly where I was now when CeCe had come into our miserable little sitting room to tell me that Pa Salt was dead.<br> <br>I put down the pen and went to pour myself a glass of water from the tap. It was clammy and airless in the sticky heat and I drank thirstily as I contemplated the fact that I didn&#x2019;t need to do this&#x2014;to put myself through the pain of remembering. It was Tiggy, my younger sister, who, when I&#x2019;d seen her at Atlantis just after Pa died, had suggested the idea.<br> <br>&#x201c;Darling Star,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, when some of us sisters had gone out onto the lake to sail, simply trying to distract ourselves from our grief, &#x201c;I know you find it hard to speak about how you feel. I also know you&#x2019;re full of pain. Why don&#x2019;t you write your thoughts down?&#x201d;<br> <br>On the plane home from Atlantis two weeks ago, I&#x2019;d thought about what Tiggy had said. And this morning, that&#x2019;s what I had endeavored to do.<br> <br>I stared at the brick wall, thinking wryly that it was a perfect metaphor for my life just now, which at least made me smile. And the smile carried me back to the scarred wooden table that our shady landlord must have picked up for nothing in a junk shop. I sat back down and again picked up the elegant ink pen Pa Salt had given me for my twenty-first birthday.<br> <br>&#x201c;I will not start with Pa&#x2019;s death,&#x201d; I said out loud. &#x201c;I will start when we arrived here in London&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The crash of the front door closing startled me and I knew it was my sister CeCe. Everything she did was loud. It seemed beyond her to put a cup of coffee down without banging it onto the surface and slopping its contents everywhere. She had also never grasped the concept of an &#x201c;indoor voice&#x201d; and shouted her words to the point where, when we were small, Ma was once worried enough to get her hearing tested. Of course, there was nothing wrong with it. In fact, it was the opposite&#x2014;CeCe&#x2019;s hearing was overdeveloped. There was nothing wrong with me either when a year later Ma took me to a speech therapist, concerned at my lack of chatter.<br> <br>&#x201c;She has words there, she just prefers not to use them,&#x201d; the therapist had explained. &#x201c;She will when she&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>At home, in an attempt to communicate with me, Ma had taught me the basics of French sign language.<br> <br>&#x201c;So whenever you want or need something,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said to me, &#x201c;you can use it to tell me how you feel. And this is how I feel about you right now.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d pointed at herself, crossed her palms over her heart, then pointed at me. &#x201c;I&#x2014;love&#x2014;you.&#x201d;<br> <br>CeCe had learned it quickly too, and the two of us had adopted and expanded what had begun as a means of communication with Ma to form our own private language&#x2014;a mixture of signs and made-up words&#x2014;using it when people were around and we needed to talk. We&#x2019;d both enjoyed the baffled looks on our sisters&#x2019; faces as I&#x2019;d sign a sly comment across the breakfast table and we&#x2019;d both dissolve into helpless giggles.<br> <br>Looking back, I could see that CeCe and I became the antithesis of each other as we were growing up: the less I spoke, the louder and more often she talked for me. And the more she did, the less I needed to. Our personalities had simply become exaggerated. It hadn&#x2019;t seemed to matter when we were children, squashed into the middle of our six-sister family&#x2014;we&#x2019;d had each other to turn to.<br> <br>The problem was, it mattered now . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Guess what? I&#x2019;ve found it!&#x201d; CeCe burst into the sitting room. &#x201c;And in a few weeks&#x2019; time we can move in. The developer&#x2019;s still got some finishing off to do, but it&#x2019;ll be incredible when it&#x2019;s done. God, it&#x2019;s hot in here. I can&#x2019;t wait to leave this place.&#x201d;<br> <br>CeCe went to the kitchen and I heard the whoosh of the tap being turned on full blast, knowing that the water had most likely spattered all over the worktops I had painstakingly wiped down earlier.<br> <br>&#x201c;Want some water, Sia?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No thanks.&#x201d; Although CeCe only used it when we were alone, I mentally chided myself for being irritated by the pet name she had coined for me when we were little. It came from a book Pa Salt had given me for Christmas, The Story of Anastasia, about a young girl who lived in the woods in Russia and discovered she was a princess.<br> <br>&#x201c;She looks like you, Star,&#x201d; five-year-old CeCe had said as we&#x2019;d stared at the pictures in the storybook. &#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;re a princess too&#x2014;you&#x2019;re pretty enough to be one, with your golden hair and blue eyes. So, I will call you &#x2018;Sia.&#x2019; And it goes perfectly with &#x2018;Cee&#x2019;! Cee and Sia&#x2014;the twins!&#x201d; She&#x2019;d clapped her hands in delight.<br> <br>It was only later, when I&#x2019;d learned the real history of the Russian royal family, that I understood what had happened to Anastasia Romanova and her siblings. It hadn&#x2019;t been a fairy tale at all.<br> <br>And nor was I a child any longer, but a grown woman of twenty-seven.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just know you&#x2019;re going to love the apartment.&#x201d; CeCe reappeared in the sitting room and flopped onto the scuffed leather sofa. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve booked an appointment for us to see it tomorrow morning. It&#x2019;s a shedload of money, but I can afford it now, especially as the agent told me the City is in turmoil. The usual suspects aren&#x2019;t queuing up to buy right now, so we agreed on a knockdown price. It&#x2019;s time we got ourselves a proper home.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s time I got myself a proper life, I thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re buying it?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Or at least, I will if you like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was so astonished, I didn&#x2019;t know what to say.<br> <br>&#x201c;You all right, Sia? You look tired. Didn&#x2019;t you sleep well last night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Despite my best efforts, tears came to my eyes as I thought of the long, sleepless hours bleeding toward dawn, when I&#x2019;d mourned my beloved father, still unable to believe he was gone.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re still in shock, that&#x2019;s the problem. It only happened a couple of weeks ago, after all. You will feel better, I swear, especially when you&#x2019;ve seen our new apartment tomorrow. It&#x2019;s this crap place that&#x2019;s depressing you. It sure as hell depresses me,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;Have you e-mailed the guy about the cookery course yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And when does it start?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Next week.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. That gives us time to start choosing some furniture for our new home.&#x201d; CeCe came over to me and gave me a spontaneous hug. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to show it to you.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it incredible?&#x201d;<br> <br>CeCe opened her arms wide to embrace the cavernous space, her voice echoing off the walls as she walked to the expanse of glass frontage and slid open one of the panels.<br> <br>&#x201c;And look, this balcony is for you,&#x201d; she said, as she beckoned me to follow her. We stepped outside. &#x201c;Balcony&#x201d; was too humble a word to describe what we were standing on. It was more like a long and beautiful terrace suspended in the air above the river Thames. &#x201c;You can fill it with all your herbs and those flowers you liked fiddling around with at Atlantis,&#x201d; CeCe added as she walked to the railing and surveyed the gray water far below us. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it spectacular?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded, but she was already on her way back inside so I drifted after her.<br> <br>&#x201c;The kitchen is still to be fitted, but as soon as I&#x2019;ve signed, you can have free rein to choose which cooker you&#x2019;d like, which fridge, and so on. Now that you&#x2019;re going to be a professional,&#x201d; she said with a wink.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hardly, CeCe. I&#x2019;m only doing a short course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re so talented, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll get a job somewhere when they see what you can do. Anyway, I think it&#x2019;s perfect for both of us, don&#x2019;t you? I can use that end for my studio.&#x201d; She pointed to an area sandwiched between the far wall and a spiral staircase. &#x201c;The light is just fantastic. And you get your big kitchen and the outdoor space too. It&#x2019;s the nearest thing to Atlantis I could find in the center of London.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. It&#x2019;s lovely, thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I could see how excited she was about her find, and admittedly, the apartment was impressive. I didn&#x2019;t want to burst her bubble by telling her the truth: that living in what amounted to a vast, characterless glass box overlooking a murky river could not have been farther from Atlantis if it tried.<br> <br>As CeCe and the agent talked about the blond-wood floors that were going to be laid, I shook my head at my negative thoughts. I knew that I was being desperately spoiled. After all, compared to the streets of Delhi, or the shantytowns I&#x2019;d seen on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, a brand-new apartment in the city of London was not exactly a hardship.<br> <br>But the point was that I would have actually preferred a tiny, basic hut&#x2014;which would at least have had its foundations planted firmly in the ground&#x2014;with a front door that led directly to a patch of earth outside.<br> <br>I tuned in vaguely to CeCe&#x2019;s chatter about a remote control that opened and closed the window blinds and another for the invisible surround-sound speakers. Behind the agent&#x2019;s back, she signed &#x201c;wide boy&#x201d; to me and rolled her eyes. I managed a small smile in return, feeling desperately claustrophobic because I couldn&#x2019;t open the door and just run . . . Cities stifled me; I found the noise, the smells, and the hordes of people overwhelming. But at least the apartment was open and airy . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Sia?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Cee, what did you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shall we go upstairs and see our bedroom?&#x201d;<br> <br>We walked up the spiral staircase into the room CeCe said we would share, despite there being a spare room. And I felt a shudder run through me even as I looked at the views, which were spectacular from up here. We then inspected the incredible en suite bathroom, and I knew that CeCe had done her absolute best to find something lovely that suited us both.<br> <br>But the truth was, we weren&#x2019;t married. We were sisters.<br> <br>Afterward, CeCe insisted on dragging me to a furniture shop on King&#x2019;s Road, then we took the bus back across the river, over Albert Bridge.<br> <br>&#x201c;This bridge is named after Queen Victoria&#x2019;s husband,&#x201d; I told her out of habit. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s a memorial to him in Kensington&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>CeCe curtailed me by making the sign for &#x201c;show-off&#x201d; in my face. &#x201c;Honestly, Star, don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;re still lugging a guidebook around?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I admitted, making our sign for &#x201c;nerd.&#x201d; I loved history.<br> <br>We got off the bus near our apartment and CeCe turned to me. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get supper down the road. We should celebrate.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t got the money.&#x201d; Or at least, I thought, I certainly haven&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;My treat,&#x201d; CeCe reassured me.<br> <br>We went to a local pub and CeCe ordered a bottle of beer for her and a small glass of wine for me. Neither of us drank much&#x2014;CeCe in particular couldn&#x2019;t handle her alcohol, something she&#x2019;d learned the hard way after a particularly raucous teenage party. As she stood at the bar, I mused on the mysterious appearance of the funds that CeCe had suddenly come into the day after all of us sisters had been handed envelopes from Pa Salt by Georg Hoffman, Pa&#x2019;s lawyer. CeCe had gone to see him in Geneva. She had begged Georg to let me come into the meeting with her, but he&#x2019;d refused point-blank.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sadly, I have to follow my client&#x2019;s instructions. Your father insisted that any meetings I might have with his daughters be conducted individually.&#x201d;<br> <br>So I&#x2019;d waited in reception while she went in to see him. When she&#x2019;d emerged, I could see that she was tense and excited.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Sia, but I had to sign some stupid privacy clause. Probably another of Pa&#x2019;s little games. All I can tell you is that it&#x2019;s good news.&#x201d;<br> <br>As far as I was aware, it was the only secret that CeCe had ever kept from me in our entire relationship, and I still had no idea where all this money had come from. Georg Hoffman had explained to us that Pa&#x2019;s will made it clear that we would continue to receive only our very basic allowances. But also that we were free to go to him for extra money if necessary. So perhaps we simply needed to ask, just as CeCe presumably had.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cheers!&#x201d; CeCe clinked her beer bottle against my glass. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s to our new life in London.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And here&#x2019;s to Pa Salt,&#x201d; I said, raising my glass.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;You really loved him, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I did, lots. He was . . . special.&#x201d;<br> <br>I watched CeCe as our food arrived and she ate hungrily, thinking that, even though we were both his daughters, his death felt like my sorrow alone, rather than ours.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think we should buy the apartment?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;CeCe, it&#x2019;s your decision. I&#x2019;m not paying, so it&#x2019;s not for me to comment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly, you know what&#x2019;s mine is yours, and vice versa. Besides, if you ever decide to open that envelope he left for you, there&#x2019;s no telling what you might find out,&#x201d; she encouraged.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d been on me ever since we&#x2019;d been given the envelopes. She had torn hers open almost immediately afterward, expecting me to do the same.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Sia, aren&#x2019;t you going to open it?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d pressed me.<br> <br>But I just couldn&#x2019;t . . . because whatever lay inside it would mean accepting that Pa had gone. And I wasn&#x2019;t prepared to let him go yet.<br> <br>After we&#x2019;d eaten, CeCe paid the bill and we went back to the apartment, where she telephoned her bank to have the deposit on the flat transferred. Then she settled herself in front of her laptop, complaining about the inconsistent broadband.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come and help me choose some sofas,&#x201d; she called from the sitting room as I filled our yellowing tub with lukewarm water.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just having a bath,&#x201d; I replied, locking the door.<br> <br>I lay in the water and lowered my head so that my ears and hair were submerged. I listened to the gloopy sounds&#x2014;Womb sounds, I thought&#x2014;and decided that I had to get away before I went completely mad. None of this was CeCe&#x2019;s fault and I certainly didn&#x2019;t want to take it out on her. I loved her. She had been there for me every day of my life, but . . .<br> <br>Twenty minutes later, having made a resolution, I wandered into the sitting room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice bath?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. CeCe . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come and look at the sofas I&#x2019;ve found.&#x201d; She beckoned me toward her. I did as she asked and stared unseeingly at the different hues of cream.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which one do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whichever you like. Interior design is your thing, not mine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about that one?&#x201d; CeCe pointed to the screen. &#x201c;Obviously we&#x2019;ll have to go and sit on it, because it can&#x2019;t just be a thing of beauty. It&#x2019;s got to be comfy as well.&#x201d; She scribbled down the name and address of the stockist. &#x201c;Perhaps we can do that tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>I took a deep breath. &#x201c;CeCe, would you mind if I went back to Atlantis for a couple of days?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s what you want, Sia, of course. I&#x2019;ll check out flights for us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, I was thinking I&#x2019;d go alone. I mean . . .&#x201d; I swallowed, steeling myself not to lose my impetus. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very busy here now with the apartment and everything, and I know you have all sorts of art projects you&#x2019;re eager to get going on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but a couple...</p><h2>Feasting on the Word: Year A, Vol. 2: Lent Through Eastertide</h2><p>With the twelve-volume series Feasting on the Word, Westminster John Knox Press offers one of the most extensive and well-respected resources for preaching on the market today.

Rashid uses heart-warming and humorous stories to share his techniques of teaching horses by understanding their view of the world. These tales deal with many facets of buying, owning, and training horses. Stories of Arabs, appaloosas, and paints&#x2014;mistrusted and mistreated because of their breed&#x2014;will give you a new perspective on these breeds and others. Rashid&#x2019;s accounts of horses bound for slaughter because they couldn&#x2019;t be trained will inspire you to give your own problem horse another look. And when Wil, the ugliest horse you can imagine, turns out to be the best on the ranch, you&#x2019;ll understand why a good horse is never a bad color.</p><p>Mark Rashid, author of "Considering the Horse, has worked with horses since he was ten yours old. His articles on solving problems from the horse&#x2019;s point of view have been published in "Western Horseman" and "Western Horse." He lives near Estes Park, Colorado.The title spells out one of the book's twin morals; the other is "Kindliness is better than force." Rashid (Considering the Horse), a professional horse trainer and frequent contributor to western equestrian magazines, reiterates these two themes ad nauseam, illustrating them in long-winded and meandering anecdotes, many of them reminiscences of his childhood mentor and later employer, "the old man." Admittedly Rashid has extensive experience with horses and has encountered a wide range of colorful characters in his lifetime out West. However, readers looking to glean hard information about equine behavior or training techniques will find few in proportion to the ocean of verbiage. Those who just want to cozy up with some folksy horse tales may find themselves wishing that Rashid had reined in his prolixity. Best enjoyed by true converts. <p></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in human nature; Being the Gifford Lectures on natural religion delivered at Edinburgh in 1901-1902</h2><p>"<b>The Varieties of Religious Experience</b> is certainly the most notable of all books in the field of the psychology of religion and probably destined to be the most influential [one] written on religion in the twentieth century," said Walter Houston Clark in <b>Psychology Today</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book was an immediate bestseller upon its publication in June 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the pluralistic views of psychologist-turned-philosopher William James, it posits that individual religious experiences, rather than the tenets of organized religions, form the backbone of religious life.&nbsp;&nbsp;James's discussion of conversion, repentance, mysticism, and hope of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter--as well as his observations on the religious experiences of such diverse thinkers as Voltaire, Whitman, Emerson, Luther, Tolstoy, and others--all support his thesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;"James's characteristic humor, his ability to put down the pretentious and to be unpretentious, and his willingness to take some risks in his choices of ancedotal data or provocative theories are all apparent in the book," noted Professor Martin E. Marty.&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reader will come away with more reasons to raise new questions than to feel that old ones have been resolved."</p><p><i>"I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the history of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities."</i> <p> When William James went to the University of Edinburgh in 1901 to deliver a series of lectures on "natural religion," he defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." Considering religion, then, not as it is defined by--or takes place in--the churches, but as it is felt in everyday life, he undertook a project that, upon completion, stands not only as one of the most important texts on psychology ever written, not only as a vitally serious contemplation of spirituality, but for many critics one of the best works of nonfiction written in the 20th century. Reading <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which "the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions." It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.</p>&#39;The Varieties of Religious Experience is certainly the most notable of all books in the field of the psychology of religion and probably destined to be the most influential one written on religion in the twentieth century.&#39;- Walter Houston Clark in Psychology Today</p><h2>The Bronze Horseman</h2><p>A magnificent epic of love, war and Russia from the international bestselling author of TULLY and ROAD TO PARADISE Leningrad 1941: the white nights of summer illuminate a city of fallen grandeur whose palaces and avenues speak of a different age, when Leningrad was known as St Petersburg. Two sisters, Tatiana and Dasha, share the same bed, living in one room with their brother and parents. The routine of their hard impoverished life is shattered on 22 June 1941 when Hitler invades Russia. For the Metanov family, for Leningrad and particularly for Tatiana, life will never be the same again. On that fateful day, Tatiana meets a brash young man named Alexander. The family suffers as Hitler&#39;s army advances on Leningrad, and the Russian winter closes in. With bombs falling and the city under siege, Tatiana and Alexander are drawn inexorably to each other, but theirs is a love that could tear Tatiana&#39;s family apart, and at its heart lies a secret that could mean death to anyone who hears it. Confronted on the one hand by Hitler&#39;s vast war machine, and on the other by a Soviet system determined to crush the human spirit, Tatiana and Alexander are pitted against the very tide of history, at a turning point in the century that made the modern world.</p><p><p>From the author of the international bestseller <em>Tully</em> comes an epic tale of passion, betrayal, and survival in World War II Russia. Leningrad, 1941: The European war seems far away in this city of fallen grandeur, where splendid palaces and stately boulevards speak of a different age, when the city was known as St. Petersburg. Now two sisters, Tatiana and Dasha Metanov, live in a cramped apartment, sharing one room with their brother and parents. Such are the harsh realities of Stalin's Russia, but when Hitler invades the country, the siege of its cities makes the previous severe conditions seem luxurious.</p><p>Against this backdrop of danger and uncertainty, Tatiana meets Alexander, an officer in the Red Army whose self-confidence sets him apart from most Russian men and helps to conceal a mysterious and troubled past.</p><p>Once the relentless winter and the German army's blockade take hold of the city, the Metanovs are forced into ever more desperate measures to survive. With bombs falling and food becoming scarce, Tatiana and Alexander are drawn to each other in an impossible love that threatens to tear her family apart and reveal his dangerous secret -- a secret as destructive as the war itself. Caught between two deadly forces, the lovers find themselves swept up in a tide of history at a turning point in the century that made the modern world.</p><p>Mesmerizing from the very first page to the final, breathtaking end, <em>The Bronze Horseman</em> brings alive the story of two indomitable, heroic spirits and their great love that triumphs over the devastation of a country at war.</p>Paullina Simons was born in Leningrad in 1963.

Rabbits there do live underground, but not North American cottontails. The kingfisher pictured is also the European variety, not the North American belted one, and the woodpecker is a European great spotted, not native to the New World. (And why include a woodpecker at all?) Two or three lines of text provide minimal information on each pictured critter. Under the Sea provides one factoid per creature and briefly displays the methods by which humans visit this realm. Purists may balk at the terms starfish and jellyfish as opposed to sea star and sea jelly (neither, after all, is a fish). The books use what might be termed "obscurancies," very dark transparencies underlaid with solid black pages, making the imposed images extremely shadowy. Both have a punch-out "flashlight" complete with a white circle of "light" at one end that, when passed between the obscurancy and the black page, spotlights the featured creature in full color. (A slot is provided at the back of the book for flashlight storage, but one suspects it will vanish early on.) Hardly founts of information, but if you're into tidbits and toys, certainly fun to play with.<br><i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gang Leader for a Day: A Rogue Sociologist Takes to the Streets</h2><p><b>First introduced in <i>Freakonomics</i>, here is the full story of Sudhir Venkatesh, the sociology grad student who infiltrated one of Chicago's most notorious gangs</b> <br><br> The story of the young sociologist who studied a Chicago crack-dealing gang from the inside captured the world's attention when it was first described in <i>Freakonomics</i>. <i>Gang Leader for a Day</i> is the fascinating full story of how Sudhir Venkatesh managed to gain entrance into the gang, what he learned, and how his method revolutionized the academic establishment. <br><br> When Venkatesh walked into an abandoned building in one of Chicago's most notorious housing projects, he was looking for people to take a multiple-choice survey on urban poverty. A first-year grad student hoping to impress his professors with his boldness, he never imagined that as a result of the assignment he would befriend a gang leader named JT and spend the better part of a decade inside the projects under JT's protection, documenting what he saw there. <br><br> Over the next seven years, Venkatesh got to know the neighborhood dealers, crackheads, squatters, prostitutes, pimps, activists, cops, organizers, and officials. From his privileged position of unprecedented access, he observed JT and the rest of the gang as they operated their crack-selling business, conducted PR within their community, and rose up or fell within the ranks of the gang's complex organizational structure. <br><br> In Hollywood-speak, <i>Gang Leader for a Day</i> is <i>The Wire</i> meets Harvard University. It's a brazen, page turning, and fundamentally honest view into the morally ambiguous, highly intricate, often corrupt struggle to survive in what is tantamount to an urban war zone. It is also the story of a complicated friendship between Sudhir and JT-two young and ambitious men a universe apart.<br><br><p> </p></p><p>Sudhir Venkatesh is professor of sociology and African American studies at Columbia University.

Dubner</b></i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>I believe that Sudhir Venkatesh was born with two abnormalities: an overdeveloped curiosity and an underdeveloped sense of fear.</p><p>How else to explain him? Like thousands upon thousands of people, he entered graduate school one fall and was dispatched by his professors to do some research. This research happened to take him to the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago, one of the worst ghettos in America. But blessed with that outlandish curiosity and unfettered by the sort of commonsensical fear that most of us would experience upon being held hostage by an armed crack gang, as Venkatesh was early on in his research, he kept coming back for more.</p><p>I met Venkatesh a few years ago when I interviewed him for <i>Freakonomics,</i> a book I wrote with the economist Steve Levitt. Venkatesh and Levitt had collaborated on several academic papers about the economics of crack cocaine. Those papers were interesting, to be sure, but Venkatesh himself presented a whole new level of fascination. He is soft-spoken and laconic; he doesn&#x2019;t volunteer much information. But every time you ask him a question, it is like tugging a thread on an old tapestry: the whole thing unspools and falls at your feet. Story after story, marked by lapidary detail and hard-won insight: the rogue cop who terrorized the neighborhood, the jerry-built network through which poor families hustled to survive, the time Venkatesh himself became gang leader for a day.</p><p>Although we wrote about Venkatesh in <i>Freakonomics</i> (it was many readers&#x2019; favorite part), there wasn&#x2019;t room for any of these stories. Thankfully, he has now written an extraordinary book that details all his adventures and misadventures. The stories he tells are far stranger than fiction, and they are also more forceful, heartbreaking, and hilarious. Along the way he paints a unique portrait of the kind of neighborhood that is badly misrepresented when it is represented at all. Journalists like me might hang out in such neighborhoods for a week or a month or even a year. Most social scientists and do-gooders tend to do their work at arm&#x2019;s length. But Venkatesh practically lived in this neighborhood for the better part of a decade. He brought the perspective of an outsider and came away with an insider&#x2019;s access. A lot of writing about the poor tends to reduce living, breathing, joking, struggling, sensual, moral human beings to dupes who are shoved about by invisible forces. This book does the opposite. It shows, day by day and dollar by dollar, how the crack dealers, tenant leaders, prostitutes, parents, hustlers, cops, and Venkatesh himself tried to construct a good life out of substandard materials.</p><p>As much as I have come to like Venkatesh, and admire him, I probably would not want to be a member of his family: I would worry too much about his fearlessness. I probably wouldn&#x2019;t want to be one of his research subjects either, for his curiosity must be exhausting. But I am very, very happy to have been one of the first readers of Venkatesh&#x2019;s book, for it is as extraordinary as he is.</p><p>PREFACE</p><p>I woke up at about 7:30 A.M. in a crack den, Apartment 1603 in Building Number 2301 of the Robert Taylor Homes. Apartment 1603 was called the &#x201c;Roof,&#x201d; since everyone knew that you could get very, very high there, even higher than if you climbed all the way to the building&#x2019;s actual rooftop.</p><p>As I opened my eyes, I saw two dozen people sprawled about, most of them men, asleep on couches and the floor. No one had lived in the apartment for a while. The walls were peeling, and roaches skittered across the linoleum floor. The activities of the previous night&#x2014;smoking crack, drinking, having sex, vomiting&#x2014;had peaked at about 2:00 A.M. By then the unconscious people outnumbered the conscious ones&#x2014;and among the conscious ones, few still had the cash to buy another hit of crack cocaine. That&#x2019;s when the Black Kings saw diminishing prospects for sales and closed up shop for the night.</p><p>I fell asleep, too, on the floor. I hadn&#x2019;t come for the crack; I was here on a different mission. I was a graduate student at the University of Chicago, and for my research I had taken to hanging out with the Black Kings, the local crack-selling gang.</p><p>It was the sun that woke me, shining through the Roof&#x2019;s doorway. (The door itself had disappeared long ago.) I climbed over the other stragglers and walked down to the tenth floor, where the Patton family lived. During the course of my research, I had gotten to know the Pattons&#x2014;a law-abiding family, it should be said&#x2014;and they treated me kindly, almost like a son. I said good morning to Mama Patton, who was cooking breakfast for her husband, Pops, a seventy-year-old retired factory worker. I washed my face, grabbed a slice of cornbread, and headed outside into a breezy, brisk March morning.</p><p>Just another day in the ghetto.</p><p>Just another day as an outsider looking at life from the inside. That&#x2019;s what this book is about.</p><p>ONE</p><p><i>How Does It Feel to Be Black and Poor?</i></p><p>During my first weeks at the University of Chicago, in the fall of 1989, I had to attend a variety of orientation sessions. In each one, after the particulars of the session had been dispensed with, we were warned not to walk outside the areas that were actively patrolled by the university&#x2019;s police force. We were handed detailed maps that outlined where the small enclave of Hyde Park began and ended: this was the safe area. Even the lovely parks across the border were off-limits, we were told, unless you were traveling with a large group or attending a formal event.</p><p>It turned out that the ivory tower was also an ivory fortress. I lived on the southwestern edge of Hyde Park, where the university housed a lot of its graduate students. I had a studio apartment in a ten-story building just off Cottage Grove Avenue, a historic boundary between Hyde Park and Woodlawn, a poor black neighborhood. The contrast would be familiar to anyone who has spent time around an urban university in the United States. On one side of the divide lay a beautifully manicured Gothic campus, with privileged students, most of them white, walking to class and playing sports. On the other side were down-and-out African Americans offering cheap labor and services (changing oil, washing windows, selling drugs) or panhandling on street corners.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t have many friends, so in my spare time I started taking long walks, getting to know the city. For a budding sociologist, the streets of Chicago were a feast. I was intrigued by the different ethnic neighborhoods, the palpable sense of culture and tradition. I liked that there was one part of the city, Rogers Park, where Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis congregated. Unlike the lily-white suburbs of Southern California where I&#x2019;d grown up, the son of immigrants from South Asia, here Indians seemed to have a place in the ethnic landscape along with everyone else.</p><p>I was particularly interested in the poor black neighborhoods surrounding the university. These were neighborhoods where nearly half the population didn&#x2019;t work, where crime and gang activity were said to be entrenched, where the welfare rolls were swollen. In the late 1980s, these isolated parts of the inner cities gripped the nation&#x2019;s attention. I went for many walks there and started playing basketball in the parks, but I didn&#x2019;t see any crime, and I didn&#x2019;t feel particularly threatened. I wondered why the university kept warning students to keep out.</p><p>As it happened, I attracted a good bit of curiosity from the locals. Perhaps it was because these parks didn&#x2019;t attract many nonblack visitors, or perhaps it was because in those days I dressed like a Deadhead. I got asked a lot of questions about India&#x2014;most of which I couldn&#x2019;t answer, since I&#x2019;d moved to the States as a child. Sometimes I&#x2019;d come upon a picnic, and people would offer me some of their soul food. They were puzzled when I turned them down on the grounds that I was a vegetarian.</p><p>But as alien as I was to these folks, they were just as alien to me.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>As part of my heavy course load at the U of C, I began attending seminars where professors parsed the classic sociological questions: How do an individual&#x2019;s preferences develop? Can we predict human behavior? What are the long-term consequences, for instance, of education on future generations?</p><p>The standard mode of answering these questions was to conduct widespread surveys and then use complex mathematical methods to analyze the survey data. This would produce statistical snapshots meant to predict why a given person might, say, fail to land a job, or end up in prison, or have a child out of wedlock. It was thought that the key to formulating good policy was to first formulate a good scientific study.</p><p>I liked the questions these researchers were asking, but compared with the vibrant life that I saw on the streets of Chicago, the discussion in these seminars seemed cold and distant, abstract and lifeless. I found it particularly curious that most of these researchers didn&#x2019;t seem interested in meeting the people they wrote about. It wasn&#x2019;t necessarily out of any animosity&#x2014;nearly all of them were well intentioned&#x2014;but because the act of actually talking to research subjects was seen as messy, unscientific, and a potential source of bias.</p><p>Mine was not a new problem. Indeed, the field of sociology had long been divided into two camps: those who use quantitative and statistical techniques and those who study life by direct observation, often living among a group of people.</p><p>This second group, usually called ethnographers, use their firsthand approach to answer a particular sort of question: How do people survive in marginal communities? for instance, or What makes a government policy work well for some families and not for others?</p><p>The quantitative sociologists, meanwhile, often criticized the ethnographers&#x2019; approach. They argued that it isn&#x2019;t nearly scientific enough and that the answers may be relevant only to the particular group under observation. In other words, to reach any important and generalizable conclusion, you need to rely on the statistical analyses of large data sets like the U.S. Census or other massive surveys.</p><p>My frustration with the more scientific branch of sociology hadn&#x2019;t really coalesced yet. But I knew that I wanted to do something other than sit in a classroom all day and talk mathematics.</p><p>So I did what any sensible student who was interested in race and poverty would do: I walked down the hallway and knocked on the door of William Julius Wilson, the most eminent living scholar on the subject and the most prominent African American in the field of sociology. He had been teaching at the U of C for nearly twenty years and had published two books that reshaped how scholars and policy makers thought about urban poverty.</p><p>I caught Wilson just in time&#x2014;he was about to go to Paris for a sabbatical. But he was also about to launch a new research project, he said, and I could participate if I liked.</p><p>Wilson was a quiet, pensive man, dressed in a dark blue suit. Although he had stopped smoking his trademark pipe long ago, he still looked like the kind of professor you see in movies. If you asked him a question, he&#x2019;d often let several long moments of silence pass&#x2014;he could be more than a little bit intimidating&#x2014;before offering a thoughtful response.</p><p>Wilson explained that he was hoping to better understand how young blacks were affected by specific neighborhood factors: Did growing up as a poor kid in a housing project, for instance, lead to worse educational and job outcomes than if a similarly poor kid grew up outside the projects? What about the difference between growing up in a neighborhood that was surrounded by other poor areas and growing up poor but near an affluent neighborhood? Did the latter group take advantage of the school...</p></p><h2>The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins</h2><p><b>Lobbyist, White House Lawyer, and Senate Aide on the Power of America&#x2019;s Plutocracy to Avoid Prosecution and Subvert Financial Reform</b><br><p><br>Beginning in January 2009, THE PAYOFF lays bare Washington&#x2019;s culture of power and plutocracy. It&#x2019;s the story of the twenty-month struggle by Senator Ted Kaufman and Jeff Connaughton, his chief of staff, to hold Wall Street executives accountable for securities fraud, to stop stock manipulation by high-frequency traders, and to break up too-big-to-fail megabanks.<br></p><p><br>This book takes us inside their dogged crusade against institutional inertia and industry influence as they encounter an outright reluctance by the Obama administration, the Justice Department, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to treat Wall Street crimes with the gravity they deserve. On financial reforms, Connaughton criticizes Democrats for relying on the very Wall Street technocrats who had failed to prevent the crisis and Republicans for staunchly opposing real reforms primarily to enjoy a golden opportunity to siphon fundraising dollars from the Wall Street executives who had raised millions to elect Barack Obama president.<br></p><p><br>Connaughton, a former lawyer in the Clinton White House, illuminates the pivotal moments and key decisions in the fight for financial reform that have gone largely unreported. His arch, nonpartisan account chronicles the reasons why Wall Street&#x2019;s worst offenses were left unpunished, and why it&#x2019;s likely that the 2008 debacle will happen again.</p></p><p>In January 2009, Ted Kaufman, longtime aide to Vice President Joe Biden, was appointed to fill Biden&#x2019;s seat in the U.S. Senate. Former Biden staffer and top DC lobbyist Jeff Connaughton joined Kaufman as his chief of staff. Frustrated with the systemic failures that led to a devastating financial crisis, together they led the charge in challenging both Congress and the Obama administration to rein in the excesses of Wall Street.<br><p><br>THE PAYOFF examines a culture of power elites in our nation&#x2019;s capital that is slouching toward plutocracy, an alarming tale of reformers with the best of intentions running headlong into institutional failure and influence-peddling politics. It&#x2019;s the story of a twenty-month struggle to hold Wall Street executives accountable for securities fraud, to stop stock manipulation by high-frequency traders, and to break up too-big-to-fail megabanks. In this book, we experience a U.S. senator&#x2019;s vigorous crusade against Wall Street&#x2019;s irresponsible risk-taking that destabilized the American economy. Through times of triumph and disheartening defeats, rarely witnessed from within our country&#x2019;s legislative body, we encounter inertia, behind-the-scenes maneuvering, and outright reluctance by the Obama administration, the Justice Department, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to treat Wall Street crimes with the urgency they deserve. Even Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC&#x2019;s enforcement division, when asked about federal judges rebuking the SEC for levying paltry fines, said to Kaufman: I&#x2019;m not losing any sleep over it.&#x201d; Meanwhile, the Republican Party remains staunchly opposed to significant financial reform, primarily to wring fundraising dollars from the same Wall Street players who&#x2019;d raised millions to elect Barack Obama president.<br></p><p><br>Connaughton, a former lawyer in the Clinton White House, illuminates the pivotal moments and key decisions in the fight for financial reform that have gone largely unreported. His take-no-prisoners, nonpartisan account chronicles the reasons why Wall Street&#x2019;s worst offenses were left unpunished, why Obama&#x2019;s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force was merely window dressing, why our stock markets are broken, and why it&#x2019;s likely the 2008 Wall Street driven debacle will happen again.<br></p><p><br>Finally, in an incisive self-critique, Connaughton reviews the arc of his own career from an idealistic Biden acolyte to a money-driven Professional Democrat to Washington critic and commentator and spells out why all Americans should stand united against crony capitalism.<br></p><br> I'm going to address briefly four questions, all of which go to the integrity and competitiveness of our capital markets. First, was there fraud at the heart of the financial crisis? Second, has the law enforcement response so far achieved effective levels of deterrence against financial fraud? Third, are federal law enforcement agencies sufficiently capable of detecting fraud and manipulation, particularly in markets that are increasingly complex? And finally, should Wall Street itself care about all this? In short, my answers would be yes, no, no, and yes.&#x201d;<br> Jeff Connaughton, Financial Crisis and Financial Crimes&#x201d;<br>New York Federal Reserve, Nov. 2, 2010<br><br><p><br>For me, what is deplorable is not the Justice Department&#x2019;s failure to bring charges, but its failure to be adequately dedicated and organized either to make the cases or reach a fully informed judgment that no case could be made. Given the inadequate effort, as President Obama virtually admitted in his 2012 State of the Union address when he announced the formation of yet another task force (which remains an ill-staffed farce), we&#x2019;ll never know what an appropriate effort would have produced. And that has resulted in the appearance of a double standard. If the explanation for the inadequate effort is corruption (the administration could not afford to anger Wall Street contributors), the revolving door, or a belief that the health of the financial industry is more important than legal accountability, then we have an actual double standard. I don&#x2019;t know the explanation, but in terms of faith in our institutions, it may not matter whether the double standard is real or apparent. That double standard has torn the social and moral fabric of our country in a way I find to be unforgivable.<br> from the Epilogue<br></p></p><h2>Rustic European Breads: From Your Bread Machine</h2><p>From the award-winning authors of <i>Bread In Half The Time</i> comes a complete guide to close to a hundred European-style breads to bake with the indispensable aid of your bread machine.<br><br>Nothing smells quite as wonderful as bread baking in the oven.

It&#x2019;s practically second nature to me now. Whether he&#x2019;s handsome or ugly, old or young, a picture of our child flashes across my mind. My hair is light brown and feathery fine, and if his is jet black and coarse, then I predict our child&#x2019;s hair will be the perfect texture and color. Wouldn&#x2019;t it? I always start out imagining the best possible scenarios for these children, but before long I&#x2019;ve conjured up horrific visions from the very opposite end of the spectrum.<br><br>What if his scraggly eyebrows were plastered just above my eyes with their distinctive double lids? Or what if his huge nostrils were notched into the end of my delicate nose? His bony kneecaps on my robustly curved legs, his square toenails on my highly arched foot? And while this is going through my mind, I&#x2019;m staring holes in the man, so of course he&#x2019;s convinced that I have a thing for him. I can&#x2019;t tell you how many times these encounters have ended in embarrassing misunderstandings. But still, in the end my curiosity always gets the best of me.<br><br>When a sperm and an egg unite, they create an entirely new cell&#x2014;and so a new life begins. These new beings enter the world in all kinds of shapes and sizes. But what if, when the sperm and the egg unite, they are full of animosity for each other? Wouldn&#x2019;t the creature they produce be contrary to expectation and abnormal as a result? On the other hand, if they have a great affinity for each other, their offspring will be even more splendid than they are. Of that there can be no doubt. And yet, who can ever know what kind of intentions a sperm and an egg harbor when they meet?<br><br>It&#x2019;s at times like these that the chart of my hypothetical children flashes across my mind. You know the kind of chart: the sort you would find in biology or earth science textbooks. You remember them, don&#x2019;t you, the kind that reconstructs the hypothetical shape and characteristics of an extinct creature based on fossils discovered deep in the earth? Almost always these charts include full-color illustrations of plants and beasts, either in the sea or against the sky. Actually, ever since I was a child I was terrified of those illustrations because they made the imaginary appear real. I hated opening those textbooks so much, it became my habit to search out the page with those charts first and scrutinize them. Perhaps this proves that we are attracted to what frightens us.<br><br>I can still remember the artist&#x2019;s re-creation of the Burgess Shale fauna. Derived from the Cambrian fossils discovered in the Canadian Rockies, the chart is full of preposterous creatures swimming around in the sea. The <i>Hallucigenia</i> crawls along the sediment on the ocean floor, so many spines sticking out of its back you might mistake the creature for a hairbrush; and then there&#x2019;s the five-eyed <i>Opabinia</i> curling and contorting its way around rocks and crags. The <i>Anomalocaris</i>, with its giant hook-shaped forelimbs, prowls through the dark seas in search of prey. My own fantasy chart is close to this one. It shows children swimming through the water&#x2014;the bizarre children I have produced from my phantom unions with men.<br><br>For some reason I never think about the act that men and women perform to produce these children. When I was young my classmates would make fun of boys they didn&#x2019;t like by saying things such as, &#x201c;Just the very idea of touching him makes my skin crawl!&#x201d; But I never thought about it. I would skip the part about the sex act and go right to the children and the way they would turn out. Perhaps you can say I&#x2019;m a little peculiar in that regard!<br><br>If you look closely you&#x2019;ll notice that I&#x2019;m &#x201c;half.&#x201d; My father is a Swiss national of Polish descent. They say his grandfather was a minister who moved to Switzerland to escape the Nazis and then died there. My father was in the trade business, an importer of Western-style confections. His line of work might sound impressive, but in fact the products he imported were poor-quality chocolates and cookies, nothing more than cheap snacks. He might have been known for these Western-style sweets, but when I was growing up he never once let me eat one of his products.<br><br>We lived very frugally. Our food, clothes, and even my school goods were all made in Japan. I didn&#x2019;t go to an international school but attended Japanese public elementary schools. My allowance was strictly supervised, and even the money allotted for household expenses fell short of what my mother felt was adequate.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t so much that my father decided to spend the rest of his life in Japan with my mother and me. He was just too miserly to do otherwise. He refused to spend a single cent unnecessarily. And he, of course, was the one who determined what was and wasn&#x2019;t necessary.<br><br>To prove my point, my father kept a mountain cabin in Gunma Prefecture where we spent the weekends. He liked to fish and just put his feet up while he was there. For the evening meal it was our custom to have <i>bigos</i>, prepared just the way he liked it. <i>Bigos</i> is a Polish country-style stew made of sauerkraut, vegetables, and meat. My Japanese mother hated fixing it, of that there can be little doubt. When my father&#x2019;s business failed and he took the family back to Switzerland, I hear my mother cooked Japanese white rice every night and my father scowled each time she set it on the table. I stayed behind in Japan by myself, so I can&#x2019;t be sure, but I suspect that was my mother&#x2019;s revenge on my father for his <i>bigos</i>&#x2014;or, on second thought, for his stingy selfishness.<br><br>My mother told me that she once worked for my father&#x2019;s company. I used to indulge in romantic visions of a tender love blooming between the young foreign owner of a small company and the local girl who worked for him. But in fact, as the story goes, my mother had been married before, and when that didn&#x2019;t work out she returned home to Ibaraki Prefecture. She worked as a maid in my father&#x2019;s house, and that is how they met.<br><br>I had wanted to ask my mother&#x2019;s father to give me more details, but now it&#x2019;s too late. He&#x2019;s senile and has forgotten everything. In my grandfather&#x2019;s mind, my mother is still alive and remains a cute little girl in middle school; my father, my younger sister, and I do not even exist.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s Caucasian, and I suppose you could describe him as small-framed. He isn&#x2019;t particularly attractive, but he isn&#x2019;t ugly either. A Japanese person who met my father would have a difficult time trying to pick him out on a European street, that much is certain. Just as all &#x201c;Orientals&#x201d; look the same to whites, to an Oriental, my father was just your typical white man.<br><br>Shall I describe his features? His skin is white with a ruddy touch. His eyes are memorable for being a faded, mournful blue. In a flash they can gleam with cruel intensity. From a physical standpoint his most attractive feature is his shiny brown hair with its brilliant golden luster. It&#x2019;s now gone white, I suppose, and balding at the crown. He wears somber-hued business suits. If you ever see a middle-aged white man wearing a beige button-up raincoat even in the dead of winter, that would be my father.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s Japanese is good enough for an average conversation, and there was a time when he loved my Japanese mother. When I was little he would always say, &#x201c;When your dad came to Japan he planned on going home as soon as he could. But he was struck by a bolt of lightning that left him paralyzed and unable to return. That lightning was your mother, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>I think it&#x2019;s the truth. Well, I think it <i>was</i> the truth. My father and mother fed my sister and me on a diet of romantic dreams just as though they were giving us candy. Gradually the dreams wore thin, until in the end they wasted away to nothing. I&#x2019;ll tell that story in due course.<br><br>The way I saw my mother when I was little and the way I see her now are completely different. When I was little I was convinced that there wasn&#x2019;t a woman more beautiful than she in all the world. Now that I&#x2019;ve grown up, I realize that she was just average-looking, and not particularly attractive even for a Japanese. Her head was large and her legs short; her face was flat and her physique poor. Her eyes and nose crowded her face for space, her teeth stuck out, and she had a weak character. She yielded to my father in everything.<br><br>My father controlled my mother. If my mother ever talked back he would lash out at her with a volley of words. Mother was not smart; in fact, she was a born loser. Oh? Do you think I&#x2019;m being too critical? It never even occurred to me. Why am I so unforgiving when it comes to my mother? Let&#x2019;s just keep that question in mind as we go along, shall we?<br><br>The one I really want to talk about is my sister. I had a sister who was a year younger than me. Her name was Yuriko. I have no idea how best to describe her, but if I were to come up with one word, it would be <i>monster</i>. She was terrifyingly beautiful. You may doubt that a person can be so beautiful that she is monstrous. Being beautiful is far preferable to being ugly, after all&#x2014;at least that&#x2019;s the general consensus. I wish I could give people who hold that opinion just one glimpse of Yuriko.<br><br>People who saw Yuriko were first overwhelmed by how gorgeous she was. But gradually her absolute beauty would grow tiresome, and before long they would find her very presence&#x2014;with her perfect features&#x2014;unnerving. If you think I&#x2019;m exaggerating, the next time I&#x2019;ll bring you a photo. I&#x2019;ve felt the same way about her all my life, even though I was her older sister. I have no doubt you&#x2019;ll agree too.<br><br>Occasionally I have this ...</p><h2>Return to Thrush Green (Thrush Green Series #5)</h2><p>Miss Read&#39;s delightful chronicles of life in Thrush Green continue with RETURN TO THRUSH GREEN.

Easy for an Ulru-Ujurrian to do. But then, everything was easy for an Ulru-Ujurrian to say and do. Unimaginably powerful, preposterously playful, and possessed of talents as yet unmeasured&#x2013;and quite possibly unmeasurable&#x2013;they went about their daily activities without a care in the world&#x2013;short of keeping busy by way of the unfathomable playtime that involved moving their planet closer to its sun. <br><br>Even that bit of outrageous astrophysics seemed simpler to Flinx than unraveling the mystery of his origins. <br><br>He had been given a clue. For the first time in many seemingly interminable years, a tangible clue. And even more than that, he had been provided with a destination. It lay before him now, a world he had never considered before, lying the same distance from his present position as his homeworld of Moth or, in a different direction, New Riviera and Clarity Held. <br><br>Clarity, Clarity. Under the proficient ministrations and attentive guardianship of his old friends Bran Tse-Mallory and Truzenzuzex, she would be recovering from the injuries she had sustained during the fight that had allowed him to successfully flee New Riviera, also known as Nur. While his love was healing physically, perhaps he could finally heal the open wound of his unknown origins. These chafed and burned within him as intensely as any cancer. <br><br><i>Gestalt</i>. <br><br>A word bursting with meaning. Perhaps also a <i>world </i>full of meaning, as it was the name of the globe his ship was rapidly approaching. An undistinguished colony world, H Class VIII, with a single large moon whose orbit the <i>Teacher </i>was presently cutting. Home to a native species called the Tlel, as well as to a modest complement of human colonists. Rather eccentric human colonists, if the details contained within the galographic he had perused were to be believed. Not that he expected to interact very much with the general population. He was here to find something specific. Something for which he had been searching a long, long time, without any real hope of ever finding it. Now, for the first time in years, he had hope. <br><br>That is, he did if what he had been told was not a cynical dying man&#x2019;s final provocation&#x2013;a last lie intended to exact a final measure of revenge on the youth responsible for his death. <br><br><i>I know who your father is, </i>Theon al-bar Cocarol had wheezed on Visaria just prior to dying. Self-proclaimed sole unmindwiped survivor of the renegade, edicted eugenicist Meliorare Society, he had dubbed Flinx <i>Experiment Twelve-A </i>before gasping out <i>Gestalt! </i>and then inconveniently expiring. <i>Experiments are not supposed to have knowledge of their biological progenitors, </i>he had coldly insisted earlier.<br> <br>To the Great Emptiness with that, Flinx had decided immediately. In his lifelong search for his origins he had pursued more than his share of dead ends. It would only be one more irony in a life filled to bursting with them if a lead supplied by a dying outlaw turned out to be the right one. <br><br>Equally important had been the expiring scientist&#x2019;s choice of words. <i>I know who your father is, </i>Cocarol had declaimed before gasping his last. Penultimate breath or not, Flinx had not confused the tense. Cocarol had clearly and unmistakably said &#x201c;is.&#x201d; Not <i>was, </i>but <i>is</i>. So small a word, so full of promise. Was it possible, Flinx had been unable to keep himself from musing ever since that critical, piercing moment, that he might not only finally learn the identity of his father, but actually find him alive? It was too much to hope for. <br><br>So he did not hope. He had been disappointed too often before. But he allowed himself, had to allow himself, space in which to wish. <br><br>Intent on the fate of the galaxy and every one of its inhabitants civilized or otherwise, his mentors Bran Tse-Mallory and the Eint Truzenzuzex would almost certainly not have sympathized with his present detour. Much as she loved him, Clarity might not have sympathized, either. But she would have understood. Even with the fate of so much and so many at stake, there were private demons that had to be put to rest before Flinx could fully focus on external threats, no matter how vast in extent they might be. Save the inner universe first, he kept telling himself, and you&#x2019;re likely to be in better condition to make a stab at saving everything else. <br><br>Sprawled like a length of pink-and-green rope below the <i>Teacher</i>&#x2019;s foreport, Pip lifted her head to glance across at him. Epitomizing the empathetic bond that existed between them, the minidrag&#x2019;s attitude reflected her friend and master&#x2019;s anguish. <br><br>&#x201c;Am I selfish?&#x201d; he asked the ship, after explicating his disquiet aloud. <br><br>&#x201c;Of course you are.&#x201d; The <i>Teacher</i>&#x2019;s ship-mind had been programmed for many things. Subtlety was not to be counted among them. &#x201c;The fate of a galaxy rests in your hands. Or rather, in lieu of a cheap analogy, in your mind.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh. Assuming I exist in this hypothetical position to do anything at all about it, notwithstanding what Bran and Tru seem to think.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;In the absence of an alternative specifically encouraging, they seek surcease in the exploration of remote possibilities. Of which you are, like it or not, ostensibly the most promising.&#x201d; <br><br>Flinx nodded. Rising from the command chair, he strolled over to the manual console and absently ran his hand down the length of Pip&#x2019;s back. The flying snake quivered with pleasure. <br><br>&#x201c;What do <i>you </i>think?&#x201d; he asked softly. &#x201c;<i>Am </i>I the last hope? Am I the key to something bigger, something more powerful, that visits me in dreams? Or whatever you want to call that perversely altered state of consciousness in which I sometimes unwillingly find myself.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I do not know,&#x201d; the <i>Teacher </i>told him honestly. &#x201c;I serve, without pretending to understand. I can take you wherever you wish to go, except to comprehension. That destination is not programmed into me.&#x201d; <br><br>Mechanical soul, Flinx thought. Not designed to pronounce judgment. In lieu of the advice of a superior intellect, he would have to judge himself. With a sigh, he raised one hand and gestured toward the port. Soon they would need to announce themselves to planetary control with an eye toward taking up orbit. <br><br>&#x201c;What about this change of course? What do you think of my putting aside the hunt for the Tar-Aiym weapons platform in order to search for my father here, based on what the dying Meliorare told me?&#x201d; <br><br>Understanding of certain matters might not have been programmed into the <i>Teacher</i>&#x2019;s ship-mind, but contempt was. &#x201c;An insupportable waste of time. I have run a number of calculations based on the facts and variables available to me. The results are less than promising. Consider: the human Cocarol may have simply been enjoying a final, embittered joke at your expense. Or he may not have known what he was talking about. If he did, circumstances may have changed since he was last conversant with the issue at hand. Since then, any knowledge he may have possessed concerning the identity or location of your male parent may have changed radically. <br><br>&#x201c;Meanwhile, whatever lies behind the Great Emptiness continues this way. It is my opinion that your time would be better spent searching for the absent, ancient Tar-Aiym weapons platform that represents the only hope, thus far, of a device even theoretically powerful enough to counter the oncoming danger. A device with whom only you have had, and can initiate, mental contact.&#x201d; The silken yet tart mechanical voice paused briefly. &#x201c;Have I at least succeeded in instigating within you a modicum of guilt?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;The attempt is redundant,&#x201d; Flinx snapped. &#x201c;No need to refresh that which never leaves me.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That realization, at least, is encouraging,&#x201d; the ship replied. &#x201c;Since logic and reason are having no effect, I search for that which <i>will </i>work.&#x201d; <br><br>In some respects chatting with the <i>Teacher </i>was easier than engaging in conversation with a human. For example, the ship never raised its voice, and if Flinx so wished, he could terminate the discussion with a simple command. On the other hand, unlike with another person, he could not turn away from it. The ship-mind was everywhere around him. <br><br>&#x201c;As soon as I&#x2019;ve settled this question, I&#x2019;ll resume the search. I promise.&#x201d; Pip looked up at him quizzically. <br>The ship responded, &#x201c;What makes you so certain that you will settle it here? This is a question the answer to which you have sought on many worlds. As I have commented repeatedly, the dying human could have perished with a falsehood on his lips. It would not be overmuch to expect of one who had so long lived a lie himself.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know.&#x201d; A pensive Flinx raised his gaze once more to the cloud-swathed new world looming steadily larger in the foreport. As he stared, the port continuously adapted to the changing light outside the ship. Another new world in a long list of those that instead of answers had thus far provided him with only more questions. &#x201c;But after all these years, it&#x2019;s the most promising lie that I&#x2019;ve been told.&#x201d; <br><br>Though Gestalt&#x2019;s human population numbered only in the millions, he was still surprised at the informality that infused the exchange of arrival formalities.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction.

Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.</p><h2>The Real Diana</h2><p>A royal insider and author of Diana In Private presents a revealing, candid portrait of the late princess and her complex, sometimes tormented life. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Say what you will about the author of <i>The Real Diana</i>, but Lady Colin Campbell certainly is no practitioner of noblesse oblige. This is a book for those who like their gossip explicit and in large quantities, and who aren't bothered by little details like verifiable attribution. (The vast majority of quotes in this book are from "a member of the Wales household," "a lady-in-waiting," "a courtier," and most ironically of all, "a friend.") Lady Campbell claims to be the person whom Diana first approached to write the tell-all biography that Andrew Morton was later to author. And though she turned down that opportunity, this is her second publication to cash in on her "insider status" (<i>Diana in Private</i> was her first), which is seemingly a reference to her title by marriage and a casual acquaintance with the princess. <p> With its paucity of named sources, it's probably impossible to authoritatively separate fact from fiction in <i>The Real Diana</i>, though it does seem that what with affairs, petty vengeances, and temper tantrums, Di would have had little time left for her courtly duties. Campbell's style is lively enough, and she has some interesting insights into the modern British aristocracy and its unconventional values. But are you truly curious to learn not only the details of the late princess's lovers' techniques, but also the names of the two therapists Diana went to for colonic irrigation? <i>--John Longenbaugh</i></p>SHE WANTED THE WORLD TO KNOW THE TRUTH-NOW IT CAN BE TOLD... <p>By the bestselling author of <i>Diana in Private</i>. </p><p>With 8 pages of dramatic photographs!</p></p><h2>Moving Mountains: Praying with Passion, Confidence, and Authority</h2><p><p><strong>New York Times best-selling author of <em>Wild at Heart</em> John Eldredge offers readers a step-by-step guide to effective Christian prayer.</strong></p><p>How would it feel to enter into prayer with confidence and assurance&#x2014;certain that God heard you and that your prayers would make a difference?</p><p>It would likely feel amazing <em>and</em> unfamiliar.

"I'll clean that up right away, milord. So sorry, milord!" Stanton's stammering footman backed away from him rather like one would back away from a dangerous man-eating beast. Stanton raised a hand carefully to make an easing gesture, but the man squeaked and paled anyway. "S-sorry, milord!"<br>&nbsp;<br>Stanton gave up. There was no reasoning with some people. He'd only meant to apologize to the fellow for rounding the corner of the hall so suddenly and sending his own tea crashing to the floor. Now, the footman would doubtless carry tales of a close call with the master's notorious temper, and of escaping a blow by the nearest margin.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fact that he'd never raised his voice in this house in his considerably exact memory seemed to have no effect on the awe that his own dependents held him in.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes, he could be a demanding master. True, he was not one to socialize with . . . well, anyone, actually. Still, he considered himself a fair and equable fellow, not a great hairy beast who frightened beardless young footmen out of their wits and--apparently--their ability to carry a tea tray.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Young man--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Dobbins, milord!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yes, Dobbins, of course." Stanton took another calming breath. "When you've done here, I would appreciate another tea tray shortly."<br>&nbsp;<br>The man dropped to his knees as if he'd ducked a bullet and began to frantically gather the broken crockery. His hands shook so badly that the dripping shards flung droplets of tea onto Stanton's boots.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fellow nearly fainted at that. "Milord! Oh, milord, I--"<br>&nbsp;<br>Stanton could bear it no longer. He turned on his heel and strode away. Nothing useful would happen while he was present anyway. It seemed all that was required to send his household into spasms of terror was for him to walk into a room of his own house!<br>&nbsp;<br>It was always thus. Wherever he went, mothers urged their children from his path and even the most belligerent of men averted their gazes. No amount of careful grooming seemed to erase their impression that he was actually a foul and frightening ogre.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was enough to give a fellow self-doubts.<br>&nbsp;<br>So perhaps he'd been a mite tense lately. Why wouldn't he be, when the mightiest spy England had ever faced had escaped him and his fellow members of the Royal Four yet again? True, at least this time the Chimera had come out somewhat the worse for wear, scarred and run to earth, hiding from their search efforts, only one step ahead of their best men.<br>&nbsp;<br>The thought of the evil French nobleman--who had passed among them so easily as a young Cockney valet for so long--hurting and run ragged was a pleasing notion, but what Stanton truly wanted was to have the man's cold dead body laid out in front of him.<br>&nbsp;<br>Alas, that cherished hope was proving difficult to fulfill. Though the Chimera's talent for disguises had been destroyed with the slashing of his face, there was nothing wrong with the man's brilliant mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>Furthermore, the war against Napoleon had come to a troubled standoff with both sides taking heavy losses. Swords drawn at each other's throats, England and France currently stood equal, each uneasily waiting for some factor to tip the balance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thus the ample excuse for Stanton's touchy behavior lately. He was simply a bit . . . tightly wound.<br>&nbsp;<br>As he walked away, he heard another footman join the first. Their dread-heightened whispers carried clearly down the hall.<br>&nbsp;<br>"'Imself 'as been a right terror these past weeks, ain't 'e?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Dobbins grunted in agreement. "I thought I was a goner, I did!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"If he was t'ask me, I'd tell him to find himself a woman, I would. Bloke needs to let steam before 'e blows!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Won't 'appen. The master's not likely to find a bird who wouldn't run screaming from them cold eyes! Ain't no lady I've ever seen got the heart for someone like that bleak bastard!"<br>&nbsp;<br>Bleak bastard? That was a new one. Colorful, if a bit alliterative. Stanton found he rather preferred it to "demon's spawn" and "ice-cold devil." He continued on his way without comment. What good would punishing them for their disrespect do him but create yet more fear?<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, as he settled into his study to await the next version of his tea tray, it was hard to shake that last comment.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Ain't no lady I've ever seen got the heart for someone like that."<br>&nbsp;<br>Unfortunately, that appeared to be precisely the case, although not for quite the reason the footman assumed. If his presence ignited fear in the sturdy East End souls of his staff, it was nothing to what his presence did to the tender sensibilities of lovely and eligible young Society ladies.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not that he was without fault there. He was not a smooth and flirtatious fellow, nor was he able to set ladies at ease with humorous anecdotes--for he could never think of any at the necessary moments. His lack of the pretty conversation that women set such store by did nothing to dissuade them of his reputedly sinister nature.<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, what did it matter? Stanton had given up on women a long time ago and found himself better off.<br>&nbsp;<br>The very last thing he needed in his complicated existence was a woman.<br>&nbsp;<br>The door knocker rapped sharply three times, sending a resounding noise through the largely silent house. Stanton started, for he was unaccustomed to the sound. Voices came from the front hall through his partially open study door.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I wish to see Lord Wyndham." A woman's voice, clear and strong. "He wishes to see me as well. He simply doesn't know it yet."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm sorry, madam." The butler's tone was frigid. "His lordship is not inclined to be at home to uninvited guests."<br>&nbsp;<br>Stanton twisted his lips. He rarely had guests at all, invited or otherwise, which was why the knock on his front door was such an unusual occurrence. Fortunately, Grimm wasn't the sort to disobey strict orders. The person would be gone in moments and Stanton would be able to return to his work.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I cannot see that he is all that busy. He is sitting in his study, staring at the ceiling. I know because I looked through the window before I knocked."<br>&nbsp;<br>Grimm, the most ruthless butler money could buy, was reduced to sputtering at such a scandalous statement. Stanton found his own well-cultivated curiosity was aroused. He rose to his feet, drawn by his own need to know. Who was that making such a commotion in his front hall? He leaned partway through his study door.<br>&nbsp;<br>She was somewhat less than tall and very oddly dressed. Her shapeless gown was too long and dragged the ground, as evidenced by the street muck that the hem was now transferring to his own carpets. Her head was crowned with a hat several decades out of date, which sported a heavy veil that hid her profile.<br>&nbsp;<br>An unworthy supplicant, Stanton had no doubt. Grimm would handle it.<br>&nbsp;<br>He moved to step back into his study. Her head snapped around and he could nearly feel the glare piercing that dark veil.<br>&nbsp;<br>"There you are," she snapped at him. "Tell your man to let me in at once. I must speak to you." Her voice at least was cultured and melodic, despite the irritated bite of it. She was entirely odd, with her commanding manner and her bizarre appearance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Grimm sent him an agonized look. "She refuses to identify herself, my lord." Grimm looked as though another minute of the creature's company would cost him a major portion of his sanity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Stanton decided there was no need to cause the butler to have some sort of apoplectic fit. It was hard enough for Wyndham House to keep good help as it was.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fact that his growing curiosity was doing much to ease his bout of restless dissatisfaction had nothing to do with his decision.<br>&nbsp;<br>He bowed to the woman and waved his hand to another door. "If you would do me the great favor of awaiting me in the green parlor, I shall be happy to attend you in just a moment."<br>&nbsp;<br>She didn't curtsy back, or make any of the usual social noises. Instead, her veil remained facing him for a long moment.<br>&nbsp;<br>"If you think I will simply leave eventually, you are quite mistaken," she said flatly. "I have no pressing plans for the rest of the day. In fact, I have no pressing plans for the rest of my life, so I would advise you to adhere to your word and take no more than a moment."<br>&nbsp;<br>With that, she turned briskly and put herself in the green parlor, unassisted by Grimm, who was surprisingly slow on the take.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Hmm." While the woman might appear to be an escapee from Bedlam, she more sounded like a short-tempered army captain. Stanton slid a glance to Grimm, who was staring after the woman with a mixture of glowering hatred and--unbelievably, since Grimm bowed to no one but him--a tinge of respect.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Grimm, have tea and cakes brought in. Ladies like tea and cakes."<br>&nbsp;<br>Grimm said nothing as he turned away, but as he walked down the hall, Stanton was fairly sure he heard his unshakable butler mutter something about serving "venom tea and dragon cakes."<br>&nbsp;<br>Stanton returned to the study just long enough to shrug himself into his coat and tuck the papers he'd not been reading into a securely locked drawer. Depositing the key into its usual home in his weskit pocket, he strolled to the green parlor and let himself in.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lady Alicia Lawrence turned from her position at the window to greet the man she had come so far in the rain to see. Stanton Horne, Marquis of Wyndham--the only man in London who might possibly listen to what she had to say before throwing her back into the street.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was a handsome one, to be sure. She could safely admire the symmetry of his rather sharply chiseled features without any worry as to whether he found her similarly attractive.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was uncanny, really, how much more time she had on her hands since she'd stopped worrying about such things. Of course, she had very little to do with that accumulated time . . . but there was no point in crying over milk already spilled.<br>&nbsp;<br>She found her gaze lingering upon the rather sensual curve of his bottom lip and snapped her attention back to more of an overall view. What sort of man was this Lord Wyndham, whom everyone knew of but no one knew well?<br>&nbsp;<br>Even she, cut off from Society as she was, knew that he was as wealthy as a king and as mysterious as a dark wizard in his tower. She did not believe the rumors of virgin sacrifices in the attic, but then again, what did she know of virgins?<br>&nbsp;<br>He looked normal enough, if devastating dark eyes and an iron jawline could be considered normal. His thick, nearly blue-black hair was pulled back into a perfect queue, adding severity to a face that might otherwise be called beautiful.<br>&nbsp;<br>She admired his adherence to a classic style rather than the tousled Byronic mop most men were sporting these days. Those who adopted any new fashion that came around tended to be easily manipulated. She ought to know, having been such a person herself once upon a hundred years ago. Lord Wyndham did not look as though a hurricane could push him about.<br>&nbsp;<br>He bowed to her, a correct but minimal bow. She didn't bother returning the nicety. He'd quit such nonsense soon enough when her reputation came forth. "I am Lady Alicia Lawrence, daughter of the Earl of Sutherland. I have information about an attempt that will be made to kidnap His Highness, the Prince Regent. Are you interested in hearing it, or shall I find someone who cares?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Stanton felt his curiosity seep away. Oh, drat. She was one of those, the sort that saw conspiracy about every corner. He'd dealt with a few of those irrational people in his years as the Falcon, but this was the first time one of them had sought him out directly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Which posed yet another question. What had made her think the reclusive Marquis of Wyndham would be interested? Stanton decided that he would very much like to know the answer. After all, he made no practice of publicly being seen to be involved in anything even faintly political.<br>&nbsp;<br>Perhaps he ought to take Lady Alicia more seriously. "May I have my man take your bonnet?"<br>&nbsp;<br>She touched her gloved fingertips to her mildewed veil. "I would rather it remain."<br>&nbsp;<br>He ought to insist, but she might ask the one question he did not want to answer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Why?<br>&nbsp;<br>He had no desire to explain himself, for to do so would only land him in Bedlam. How could he tell this woman that he needed to see her face in order to tell if she was lying? She would ask him how he could possibly know that, and he would not be able to reply with any sort of truth, for he did not know how his peculiar talent worked. He didn't even much like to think on it, for he took pride in being a rational man, and he was . . . but for this one thing, this ability that he believed in wholeheartedly, for it had never failed him.<br>&nbsp;<br>For Stanton's entire life, he had somehow known when he was being lied to. As a child, he had detected the easy lies adults tell children as a matter of course. He had known he would not be stunted if he neglected to drink his milk, he would not die if he ran with scissors, and as much as a young lad might abuse himself, he would never, ever go blind.<br>&nbsp;<br>As he matured, he found that he could detect even the withheld truth, or at least the act of withholding. He learned the lies people told to spare themselves shame, or effort. He became familiar with the lies they uttered in pursuit of money, or of love.<br>&nbsp;<br>Veil or no, even he could tell that the person before him was losing patience with his inattention.<br>&nbsp;<br>She waved a folded sheaf of paper at him and tilted her head.

White Jr. offers a close reading of the speech Abraham Lincoln gave in 1865 at his second inauguration and declares it the man's finest and most important effort. It contains one of Lincoln's best-known lines ("With malice toward none; with charity for all"), which White admires as "a timeless promise of reconciliation." At the same time, White reminds readers that rather than yanking such brilliant rhetorical nuggets from their context, "We need to understand Lincoln's strategy for the complete speech." He provides this in some detail, describing the political environment in which Lincoln found himself, having recently won a presidential election that he nearly lost and also seeing the Confederacy begin to collapse for good. It was not a long speech, containing only 701 words of mostly one syllable each and requiring merely six or seven minutes to deliver, compared to about 35 minutes for the inaugural address he had given four years earlier. White calls these words Lincoln's "last will and testament to America." John Wilkes Booth, who attended the inaugural ceremony, would murder him the next month. Lincoln buffs in particular will appreciate this book, as will fans of Jay Winik's <i>April 1865</i>. <i>--John Miller</i><b>Ronald C.

Using the Internet, the neuroscientists Ogas and Gaddam quietly observed the raw sexual behaviors of <i>half a billion</i> people. By combining their observations with neuroscience and animal research, these two young neuroscientists finally answer the long-disputed question: what do people <i>really</i> like? Ogas and Gaddam's findings are transforming the way scientists and therapists think about sexual desire. <br><br> In their startling book, Ogas and Gaddam analyze a "billion wicked thoughts" on the Internet: a billion Web searches, a million individual search histories, a million erotic stories, a half-million erotic videos, a million Web sites, millions of online personal ads, and many other enormous sources of sexual data in order to understand the true differences between male and female desires, including: <br><br> ?Men and women have hardwired sexual cues analogous to our hardwired tastes-there are sexual versions of sweet, sour, salty, savory, and bitter. But men and women are wired with different sets of cues. <br><br> ?The male sexual brain resembles a reckless hunter, while the female sexual brain resembles a cautious detective agency. <br><br> ?Men form their sexual interests during adolescence and rarely change. Women's sexual interests are plastic and change frequently. <br><br> ?The male sexual brain is an "or gate": A single stimulus can arouse it. The female sexual brain is an "and gate": It requires many simultaneous stimuli to arouse it. <br><br> ?When it comes to sexual arousal, men prefer overweight women to underweight women, and a significant number of men seek out erotic images of women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. <br><br> ?Women enjoy writing and sharing erotic stories with other women. The fastest growing genre of erotic stories for women are stories about two heterosexual men having sex. <br><br> ?Though the male sexual brain is much more different from the female sexual brain than is commonly believed, the sexual brain of gay men is virtually identical to that of straight men. <br><br> Featuring cutting-edge, jaw-dropping science, this wildly entertaining and controversial book helps readers understand their partner's sexual desires with a depth of knowledge unavailable from any other source. Its fascinating and occasionally disturbing findings will rock our modern understanding of sexuality, just as Kinsey's reports did sixty years ago.</p><p><b>Ogi Ogas </b>studies computational models of memory, learning, and vision.

She is an occupational therapist at Wernesville State Hospital where she started a "Dough-it-yourself" bread baking therapy group.Introduction In 1954, when our father, a country doctor, bought land on which he wished to build his medical clinic, an old building sat at one end of the acreage, and a stream flowed through the property. This old building and this stream were a water-powered grist mill and a mill stream. We spent many happy hours boating on the mill pond in summer and ice skating on the mill pond in the winter. Inside the old building, the smells of wood, water, and flour blended into an incense which seemed timeless. It was a wonderful place to sit-feeling the throb of the mill stones rhythmically turning, hearing the water rushing into the turbine, and seeing the grain entering the hopper only to reappear as flour. Somehow, that hard, dry, whole grain was turned into a fine, soft flour. When our uncle, the miller, wasn&#39;t looking, we would slide our hands quickly under the spout and grab a handful of flour, quietly stuffing it into our mouths. Then sputtering as we choked on the dry flour, we were chased away, temporarily. I say temporarily, because there was something about that timeless smell of wood, water, and flour that drew us back. And so, years later, we are drawn back to this old mill. As adults we no longer steal fresh ground flour from the spout and savor it in our mouths; instead we grind the grains and bake fresh breads which we savor and share. This heritage and joy of fresh whole grains and baking is what we would like to share with you. -Sarah E. Myers and Mary Beth Lind Chapter 1- CORN Corn originated in the Americas. In fact, most early American civilizations were based on it. The Aztec and Mayan cultures of Central and South America, as well as the Appalachian Seneca Indian culture in West Virginia, were all corn cultures. While our present day diet is not based on any one grain, the grain most often raised in this part of Appalachia is corn. At our mill most of what we custom-grind is corn. Not all corn is alike. There is flint or dent corn, open pollinated or hybrid, yellow or white, field corn or sweet corn. When grinding corn for cornmeal, we most often use a yellow, field, dent, hybrid corn. Yellow is most common and best liked locally. However, if you live further south, you probably prefer white corn. The difference between the two is mostly skin-deep. Yellow corn does contain more Vitamin A than white corn. The corn most commonly ground is field corn. It is usually dried well, which enhances its grinding and keeping quality. (If you have trouble with your cornmeal molding, either the corn was not dried properly before it was ground, or you are storing it improperly.) Most often, field corn is a dent corn. The name comes from the dent that forms at the top of the kernel when the corn is dried. Each kernel is composed of both hard and soft starches. When ground, these starches yield the characteristic cornmeal texture. Flint corn, the alternate of dent corn, is better known as Indian corn. Its kernels contain soft starch in the center with a coating of flint-hard starch all around it. When flint corn is ground, it makes a corn flour because of the flint-hard starch surrounding the kernel. Corn flour or cornmeal, unlike wheat flour, contains no gluten and so cannot be used alone when you bake with yeast. At our mill, when a farmer brings corn to be ground, we accept toll or cash payment. Toll is 1/10 of the grain or flour as payment for the grinding. If I happen to be around when my husband is doing the grinding, and I realize that the corn being ground is a traditional corn such as Bloody Butcher, I whisper to my husband, &#34;Ask the farmer if we can take toll instead of cash.&#34; This way I get some good cornmeal! Whatever corn we used to grind your cornmeal, you may choose whether to buy it sifted (bolted) or not. This is mostly a matter of personal preference. Sifting, which takes out some of the bran, gives a more even textured meal, but one with less fiber. You may want to choose based upon how you plan to use the cornmeal. I prefer a sifted meal for spoon bread but an unsifted meal for cornbread. When I think of cornmeal, I immediately think of bread. However, which bread? Cornbread, the family favorite, or Yogurt Cornbread, my personal favorite? Then, too, there are the variations such as Spoon Bread, which is delicious with a pot of baked beans, or the whole range of muffins, from Cornmeal to Sweet Tofu Corn-Oat. In this section you will find Buttermilk Cornmeal Biscuits. And for an adventuresomely different, but very traditional, bread, try Salt-Rising Bread. Breads are not the only things to make with cornmeal. Start the day with Crunchy Cornmeal or Tender Cornmeal Pancakes or a bowl of Cornmeal Mush. For a snack try Corn Chips, and for a showy dinner roll try Corn Bubble Ring.</p><h2>Every Spy a Prince: The Complete History of Israel&#39;s Intelligence Community</h2><p>&#34;This book appeared in slightly different form in England under the title The imperfect spies, copyright 1989&#34;--T.p. verso.</p><p>The Israeli secret service's exalted reputation declined in 1973 with Mossad's failure to foresee the Yom Kippur War, setting off bitter and demoralizing feuds among the country's intelligence agencies, such as Shin Bet and Aman, and was further complicated by a succession of scandals in the 1980s that included the Jonathan Pollard and Mordechai Vananu arrests. Basing their work on interviews with former operatives and on declassified documents, CBS news correspondent Raviv and Israeli journalist Melman here produce a revealing critical history of the rise and decline of Israel's vaunted security and intelligence arm, from the idealistic pioneering days to the current disarray in the face of the Palestinian intifada and the shocking vulnerability of the intelligence community to material corruption. In today's Israel, claim the authors of this controversial book, "making money has become a Golden Calf, before which much of society--including its intelligence and military circles--kneels." Photos. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.The amount of detail in this book certainly lends some credence to the book's subtitle, and the journalist authors have also uncovered some fascinating new information: Israel has a number of top secret agencies, including one devoted to protecting their nuclear program and another for rescuing Jews from unfriendly countries; nuclear weapons using submarine-based launch platforms are nearly a reality; and Israel has been spying on the United States for years. The authors work diligently in this book to convince the world of the high morality of the Israeli cause. Israeli intelligence has been a popular subject for fiction and nonfiction, but there has yet to be a definitive nonfiction account on the subject. This readable and entertaining book is recommended for larger Middle East collections. --David P.

Awarded the Agatha Best Novel Award and nominated for the Edgar Best Novel Rhys's titles have received rave reviews around the globe.</i></strong><br> Rhys Bowen is a transplanted Brit who now divides her time between California and Arizona. She currently writes two mystery series, the Molly Murphy novels, about an Irish immigrant in 1900s New York City and the lighter Royal Spyness mysteries about a penniless minor royal in 1930s Britain. Her books made bestseller lists, garnered many awards, nominations, and starred reviews.The pseudymous Bowen, a veteran English mystery author, continues the estimable cozy series starring Constable Evan Evans (Evans Above, 1997). Llanfair, North Wales, has suddenly become a hotbed of change: a single woman and her daughter move into the village; Colonel Arbuthnot, a yearly visitor from London, discovers a ruin in the nearby hills he claims is the relic of Camelot; and native Ted Morgan returns to his hometown with grandiose plans to turn an abandoned mine into a theme park. That the Colonel dies after he has sown visions of fame and plenty among Llanfair residents raises suspicions of homicide in Evans. When Morgan is found shot to death, Evans is convinced that the two incidents are related. With the help of Sergeant Watkins, he attempts to establish a connection between the prodigal former resident, the beautiful young woman and the elderly visitor. The only apparent link seems to rest in London, prompting the intrepid Welshmen to brave the metropolis and solve the case. In the course of tracking down the killer, Evans becomes the object of desire for the new woman, a turn of events that jeopardizes his relationship with a local teacher. Bowen's quiet humor and her appreciation for rural village life make this a jewel of a story. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Spy Who Came In From The Cold</h2><p>From the author of THE HONOURABLE SCHOOLBOY, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY and SMILEY&#39;S PEOPLE, a thriller about an intelligence agent who has decided to put his life of espionage behind him, but first there is one more dangerous assignment to accomplish.</p><p>It would be an international crime to reveal too much of the jeweled clockwork plot of Le Carr�'s first masterpiece, <i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</i>. But we are at liberty to disclose that Graham Greene called it the "finest spy story ever written," and that the taut tale concerns Alec Leamas, a British agent in early Cold War Berlin. Leamas is responsible for keeping the double agents under his care undercover and alive, but East Germans start killing them, so he gets called back to London by Control, his spy master. Yet instead of giving Leamas the boot, Control gives him a scary assignment: play the part of a disgraced agent, a sodden failure everybody whispers about. Control sends him back out into the cold--deep into Communist territory to checkmate the bad-guy spies on the other side. The political chessboard is black and white, but in human terms the vicinity of the Berlin Wall is a moral no-man's land, a gray abyss patrolled by pawns.<p> Le Carr� beats most spy writers for two reasons. First, he knows what he's talking about, since he raced around working for British Intelligence while the Wall went up. He's familiar with spycraft's fascinations, but also with the fact that it leaves ideals shaken and emotions stirred. Second, his literary tone has deep autobiographical roots. Spying is about betrayal, and Le Carr� was abandoned by his mother and betrayed by his father, a notorious con man. (They figure heavily in his novels <i>Single &amp; Single</i> and <i>A Perfect Spy</i>.) In a world of lies, Le Carr� writes the bitter truth: it's every man for himself. And may the best mask win. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"Le Carre is simply the world's greatest fictional spymaster."<br>NEWSWEEK<br>For Leamas the espionage business has become an hermetic, enclosed world, detached from outside reality. He has watched his last agent being shot, crossing from East to West Berlin, and his death marks the end of the Circus' East German network. But Control is planning an operation against the head of East German Intelligence. And Leamas is to be the instrument, set in East one last time....</p><h2>Internal Combustion: How Corporations and Governments Addicted the World to Oil and Derailed the Alternatives</h2><p><i>Internal Combustion</i> is the compelling tale of corruption and manipulation that subjected the U.S. and the world to an oil addiction that could have been avoided, that was never necessary, and that could be ended not in ten years, not in five years, but today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Edwin Black, award-winning author of <i>IBM and the Holocaust</i>, has mined scores of corporate and governmental archives to assemble thousands of previously uncovered and long-forgotten documents and studies into this dramatic story. Black traces a continuum of rapacious energy cartels and special interests dating back nearly 5,000 years, from wood to coal to oil, and then to the bicycle and electric battery cartels of the&nbsp;1890s, which created thousands of electric vehicles that plied American streets a century ago. But those noiseless and clean cars were scuttled by petroleum interests, despite the little-known efforts of Thomas Edison and Henry Ford to mass-produce electric cars powered by personal backyard energy stations. Black also documents how General Motors criminally conspired to undermine mass transit in dozens of cities and how Big Oil, Big Corn, and Big Coal have subverted synthetic fuels and other alternatives.<br>&nbsp;<br>He then brings the story full-circle to the present day oil crises, global warming and beyond. Black showcases overlooked compressed-gas, electric and hydrogen cars on the market today, as well as inexpensive all-function home energy units that could eliminate much oil usage. His eye-opening call for a Manhattan Project for immediate energy independence will help energize society to finally take action.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Internal Combustion</i>, and its interactive website www.internalcombustionbook.com, will generate a much-needed national debate at a crucial time.

The timeless story of Toad, Rat, Mole, and Badger has delighted readers of all ages for more than eighty years.</b><br><br>Friendly Rat, mild-mannered Mole, wise Badger, and kind&#x2014;but conceited&#x2014;Toad all live on the banks of the Thames. While Mole and Rat are content to go out in a row boat or travel the roads in a caravan, Toad prefers the excitement of motor cars. He&#x2019;s already wrecked seven! While his friends try to keep him out of trouble, his passion for cars eventually results in his being caught and kept prisoner in the remotest dungeon of the best-guarded castle in all the land. Somehow, he has to escape and get home but what will he find when he gets there?<br> <br><i>The Wind in the Willows</i> is a book for those &#x201c;who keep the spirit of youth alive in them; of life, sunshine, running water, woodlands, dusty roads, winter firesides.&#x201d; So, wrote Kenneth Grahame of his timeless tale of Rat, Mole, Badger, and Toad.</p><p>"[Mole] thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud.

Of course there is a multitude of churches, church networks, and denominations, each with their own doctrinal statement with many points of disagreement. But while Christians disagree on a number of doctrines, there are key elements that cannot be denied by anyone claiming to be a follower of Jesus.</p> <p>In <em>Doctrine: What Christians Should Believe</em>, Driscoll and Breshears teach thirteen of these key elements.

Allison</strong><strong>,</strong> Associate Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>"I like Doctrine very much. It is a relatively short, clear, and accurate topical summary of biblical teachings, focused on the practical application of doctrine. There is much here to aid readers who have thought in the past that theology was too complicated, uninteresting, or irrelevant. This book is none of those things. It takes off on wings of eagles. It is so important today that believers understand and become committed to all that God's Word says. This book is a wonderful tool to help them do that."<br>&#x2014;<strong>John M. Frame</strong>, J. D. Trimble Chair of Systematic Theology and Philosophy, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando, Florida</p><p>"Mark Driscoll and Gerry Breshears have accomplished the unusual: they have written a book on doctrine that is both interesting and substantive! Doctrine is rigorously biblical and theologically faithful. It lays out with clarity the great truths of the faith, showing their essential character and practical import. This is a good gift for the body of Christ. I will be happy to commend to it to the seasoned saint and the new believer."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Daniel L. Akin</strong>, President, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>"I offer my unlimited limited endorsement of Doctrine. It's limited with respect to acknowledging that not everyone needs to agree with every point of doctrine outlined in the book in order to benefit from the fair-minded treatment that Mark Driscoll and Gerry Breshears give to each of the Christian doctrines examined. In areas where Christians are known to hold differing views, Driscoll and Breshears respectfully outline options before clearly stating their own beliefs. It's unlimited with respect to wholeheartedly embracing the clear ambition of the book. In an age when people, even Christians, place such high personal value on internal experience, we desperately need to look outside ourselves&#x2014;to the doctrines of the Bible&#x2014;to truly hear and receive the good news of Jesus Christ."<br>&#x2014;<strong>James H. Gilmore</strong>, author, <em>The Experience Economy</em>&nbsp;and <em>Authenticity</em></p><p>"I listened to the sermon series that preceded this book and was very excited to hear they were putting it all into print. Doctrine should not be a dirty word in the church. Right now the need for Christians to hold fast to biblical truth is greater than ever, and this book is a solid, sleek, no-nonsense resource that is perfect for equipping every believer with the knowledge of essential biblical doctrines."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Dustin Kensrue</strong>, singer and guitarist, Thrice</p><p>"Whenever a new book comes across my desk I always ask What am I going to do with this? The answer is not always immediately clear. But with this book, I knew within the first few pages: I&#x2019;m going to buy a number of copies, give them to our leaders, and tell them to give the copies to young Christians to read. Breshears and Driscoll have done us all a huge favor in writing Doctrine. Foundational truths are explained in clear and accessible terms.

At the beginning of the 21st century, against similar adversaries, Driscoll and Breshears brilliantly, comprehensively, and without compromise restate the absolute importance of doctrine, without which there is no Christ and no Christianity."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Peter R. Jones</strong>, Director, <em>truthXchange,</em> Scholar-in-Residence and Adjunct Professor, Westminster Seminary California</p><p>"In this helpful and accessible book, Driscoll and Breshears lay out the key doctrines of the Christian faith.

That single ray of illumination, shaped by the ancient master-carved lens in the ceiling of the long and narrow chapel hewn out of the red rock cliffs, bathed the celebrant. His green tunic and trousers, trimmed in purple, shimmered. So did the alabaster makeup that covered his face. The blue-silver threads in the black short-haired wig picked up the light, creating a halo around his face. The black boots, with inset lifts, reflected light as if they too were burnished mirrors.<br>A long chord echoed through the temple, but the priest did not speak until all was silent.<br>&#x201c;When our forebears turned their backs on the True Duarchy, then the One Who Is turned away and let the Cataclysm fall upon Corus...&#x201d; The celebrant&#x2019;s voice seemed to come from everywhere, yet nowhere.<br>More than a hundred worshippers stood with bowed heads, heads covered with black scarves of mourning. Only a handful dared to look from lowered heads toward the front of the temple.<br>&#x201c;The Cataclysm did not have to happen. The misery and suffering did not have to come to pass. And why did it come to be? How could so many be so blind?&#x201d;<br>The only response to his questions was silence.<br>&#x201c;The Duarchy of Corus bestowed peace and prosperity upon all the world, for generation upon generation. Never was there so fair a realm, so just a world. Never were so blessed the peoples of a world. Never had so many benefited so much. And then, in an instant, it all vanished...&#x201d;<br>In the next-to-last line of worshippers stood a dark-haired figure in gray. He was a head taller than those around him, and his face paler. The weave of the wool of his traveling cloak was somewhat finer. His head was bent slightly less than the heads of others, and his eyes never left the celebrant. The faintest hint of an amused smile appeared from time to time at the corners of his thin lips.<br>&#x201c;...as the Mantra of Mourning declares...Ice flowed from the skies. The air that had been so fair, and perfumed, became as thin and as acrid as vinegar. Streams dried in their beds, rivers in their courses, never to flow again...All that had been beautiful and great perished and was lost. And for what reason?&#x201d;<br>After a momentary silence, the priest answered, &#x201c;Because people were selfish and thought only of themselves. They turned their backs on the True Duarchy, and when they did so, they turned their backs on the One Who Is...for the Duarchy was indeed His creation...<br>&#x201c;...in this world of transitory glory, when warlord succeeds warlord, and battle follows battle, and evil follows evil, we must persevere. We must have faith in the One Who Is. We must follow the path of righteousness to restore the old truths. For only by the instrument of the True Duarchy shall we be redeemed. Only by restoring the true creation of the One Who Is shall we once more see peace and prosperity, faith and faithfulness...&#x201d;<br>The traveler in gray nodded, appreciatively, and continued to listen.<br>&#x201c;...even today, the troubles continue. The hills to the north and west have become so dry in your lifetimes that they support nothing but twisted trees and spiky thorn, and yet the unbelievers do not see. Even here in Hyalt, where it is obvious, they do not see...<br>&#x201c;...when the only deity is gold, when the only rule is power, when the only law is that laid down by the longest blade, by the deadliest rifle, no man can be safe, and none can find security. There are no arts, no fine buildings, no wondrous words, nothing but gold and blood...&#x201d;<br>The traveler continued to listen, until at last came a hymn and the concluding refrain:<br>* * *<br>&#x201c;...for the beauty of the skies and sea,<br>the full return of perfect harmony,<br>the blessings of the True Duarchy<br>and for the One Who Will Always Be!&#x201d;<br>* * *<br>After the hymn, the priest turned to the worshippers. &#x201c;Praise to the One Who Is! And for His creation of the Duarchy!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And for His creation of the Duarchy!&#x201d; repeated the congregation.<br>&#x201c;Praise to the One Who Is! For He will come again in glory!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For He will come again in glory!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Praise to Him and His True Duarchy!

Then, slowly, more indirect light filtered into the temple as the skylight portals, with their gauze-covered panes, were uncovered.<br>The sanctuary at the front of the temple was empty.<br>The gray-clad traveler made his way forward, toward the side entrance leading to the chambers of the celebrant. His fingers touched briefly the outer garments over the heavy leather wallet hidden beneath his cloak and filled with golds.<br><br>Copyright 2004� by L. E.

The <i>Charleston Post and Courier</i> proclaims Elizabeth Peters &#x201c;a mistress of plot,&#x201d; while the <i>New York Times Book Review </i>declares, &#x201c;Amelia remains an irrepressible delight.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Named 1998 Grand Master by Mystery Writers of America, Elizabeth Peters is also a doctor of Egyptology whose mysteries have submerged readers in the vivid turn-of-the-century world of Amelia Peabody. In <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i> Peters captures the immediacy of uncovering a new Egyptian tomb within the context of a tightly plotted murder investigation involving the entire Emerson Peabody clan. The characters, including Amelia's husband, Radcliffe Emerson, and her gifted son, Ramses, are meticulously drawn. As in previous novels the dialogue is reminiscent of <i>The Thin Man</i>. When a man calls out to passing suffragettes, "You ought to be 'ome washin' your 'usband's trousers!" Ramses shoots back, "I assure you, sir, the lady's trousers are not in such sore need of laundering as your own." Peters also toys with differing narrative perspectives, and Ramses emerges as a possible successor to his mother's legacy of crime solving.<p> <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i> begins in 1907 in England where Amelia is attending a suffragettes' rally outside the home of Mr. Geoffrey Romer of the House of Commons. It seems Romer is one of the few remaining private collectors of Egyptian antiquities, and a series of bizarre events at the protest soon embroil Amelia in grave personal danger. Suspecting that the Master Criminal, Sethos, is behind their problems, the Emerson Peabodys hasten to Egypt to continue their studies in the Valley of Kings where they soon acquire a papyrus of the <i>Book of the Dead</i>. As with past seasons, however, their archaeological expedition is interrupted. The murdered body of a woman is found in the Nile. Ramses, Radcliffe, and Amelia all have their theories as to the origin of the crime, but their own lives might soon be at stake if the cult of Thoth and their ancient book is, indeed, involved.</p><p> Other Peabody mysteries include <i>Seeing a Large Cat</i>, <i>The Hippopotamus Pool</i>, <i>The Snake, the Crocodile, and the Dog</i>, <i>The Deeds of the Disturber</i>, <i>Lion in the Valley</i>, <i>The Curse of the Pharaohs</i>, and <i>Crocodile on the Sandbank</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>All hail the jubilant return of the redoubtable Amelia Peabody! Together with her sexy yet irascible archaeologist husband, Radcliffe Emerson; their handsome but wily heir, Ramses; Ramses' inscrutably elegant friend David; and the elder Emerson's ward: beautiful, trouble-seeking Nefret Forth--Edwardian Egypt may never be the same. The tenth in an award winning series, here is splendid entertainment as dazzling as it is daring from the hand of a respected Egyptologist. In the words of The Philadelphia Inquirer, "Amelia has really pitched her tent in our hearts." <p>The prospects for the 1907 archaeological season in Egypt seem fairly dull to Amelia Peabody. Despite her adored husband's brilliant reputation in his field, his dashing-yet-less-than-diplomatic behavior has Professor Radcliffe Emerson ignominiously demoted to examining only the most boring tombs in the Valley of the Kings--mere leftovers, really. All the Peabody Emersons profess stiff upper lips and intend to make the best of a bad situation, but this year the legendary land of the pharaohs will yield more than priceless artifacts for the Emerson expedition. For the desert guards even deeper mysteries that are wrapped in greed--and sealed by murder. </p><p>In a seedy section of Cairo, the youngest members of the expedition purchase a mint-condition papyrus of the famed Book of the Dead, the collection of magical spells and prayers designed to ward off the perils of the underworld and lead the deceased into everlasting life. But for as long as there have been graves, there have also been grave robbers--as well as those who believe tomb violators risk the wrath of gods like Thoth, the little baboon who protects the scales used to weigh such precious commodities as hearts and souls. </p><p>Besides facing the ire of ancient deities, their adventure into antiquity also puts Amelia and company in the sights of Sethos, the charismatically compelling but elusive Master Criminal whose bold villainies have def</p></p><h2>The Faithful Executioner: Life and Death, Honor and Shame in the Turbulent Sixteenth Century</h2><p>THE FAITHFUL EXECUTIONER</p><p><p><b>Joel F.

Most of them were on cordial terms with Schmidt, the prince-bishop&#x2019;s new executioner, but remained wary of inviting him or any of his family members into their homes. His son, Frantz, the focus of his father&#x2019;s attention on this May day in 1573, appeared to be a polite and&#x2014;if one could say this of the offspring of a hangman&#x2014;well-bred youth of nineteen. Like many teenagers of the day, he planned to follow his father into the same craft, a path he began as early as the age of eleven or twelve. Frantz&#x2019;s childhood and adolescence had been spent in his native Hof, a small provincial town in the far northeast corner of modern-day Bavaria, ten miles from what is now the Czech border. Since the family&#x2019;s move to Bamberg eight months earlier, he had already accompanied Heinrich to several executions in the city and nearby villages, studying his father&#x2019;s techniques and assisting in minor ways. As he grew in size and maturity, his responsibilities and skills developed apace. Ultimately he intended to become, like his father, a master in the practice of &#x201c;special interrogation&#x201d; (i.e., torture) and in the art of efficiently dispatching a condemned soul in the manner prescribed by law, using methods that ranged from the common <i>execution with the rope</i>, to the less frequent death by fire or by drowning, to the infamous and exceptionally rare <i>drawing and quartering</i>. <br>Today Meister Heinrich was testing Frantz on the most difficult&#x2014;and most honorable&#x2014;of all forms of execution, <i>death by the sword</i>, or beheading. Only during the past year had father considered son capable and worthy of wielding his cherished &#x201c;judgment sword,&#x201d; an engraved and elegantly crafted seven-pound weapon that spent most of its time hanging in an honored spot over their fireplace. They&#x2019;d begun their practice months earlier with pumpkins and gourds before moving on to sinewy rhubarb stalks, which better simulated the consistency of the human neck. Frantz&#x2019;s first attempts were predictably clumsy and at times endangered himself and his father, who held <i>the poor sinner</i> firmly in place. Over the weeks, his gestures gradually became more fluid and his aim more accurate, at which point Meister Heinrich deemed his son ready to ascend to the next level, practicing on goats, pigs, and other &#x201c;senseless&#x201d; livestock. <br>Today, at Schmidt&#x2019;s request, the local &#x201c;dog slayer,&#x201d; or knacker, had assembled a few stray canines and brought them in his ramshackle wooden cages to the executioner&#x2019;s residence in the heart of the city. Schmidt paid his subordinate a small tip for the favor and removed the animals to the enclosed courtyard behind the house, where his son was waiting. Though there was only an audience of one, Frantz was visibly anxious. Pumpkins, after all, did not move, and even pigs offered little resistance. Perhaps he felt a twinge of apprehension about killing &#x201c;innocent&#x201d; domestic animals, though this is likely an anachronistic projection.3 Above all, Frantz knew that successful decapitation of the former pets before him, each requiring one steady stroke, would be the final step in his apprenticeship, a visible sign of his father&#x2019;s approval and of his own readiness to go out into the wider world as a journeyman executioner. Meister Heinrich again played the part of the assistant and held the first yapping dog fast while Frantz tightened his grip on the sword.4 <br> <i>A dangerous world</i> <br>Fear and anxiety are woven into the very fabric of human existence. In that sense they link all of us across the centuries. The world of Heinrich Schmidt and his son, Frantz, however, was characterized by much more individual vulnerability than members of a modern, developed society might imagine bearable. Hostile natural and supernatural forces, mysterious and deadly epidemics, violent and malevolent fellow human beings, accidental or intentional fires&#x2014;all haunted the imaginations and daily lives of early modern people. The resulting climate of insecurity may not account entirely for the frequent brutality of the era&#x2019;s judicial institutions, but it does offer a context for understanding how institutional enforcers like the Schmidts might simultaneously be viewed with gratitude and disgust by their contemporaries.5 <br>The precariousness of life was evident from the very beginning. Having survived a combined miscarriage and stillborn rate that claimed at least one in three fetuses, Frantz Schmidt entered the world with only a fifty-fifty chance of reaching his twelfth birthday. (Childbirth also presented real risks for the mother, with one in twenty women dying within seven weeks of delivery&#x2014;a significantly higher rate than in even the worst-off of modern developing nations.) The first two years of a child&#x2019;s life were the most dangerous, as frequent outbreaks of smallpox, typhus, and dysentery proved particularly fatal to younger victims. Most parents experienced firsthand the death of at least one child, and most children the death of a sibling and one or both parents.6 <br>One of the most common causes of premature death was infection during one of the innumerable epidemics that swept through Europe&#x2019;s cities and countryside. Most people who reached the age of fifty would have survived at least half a dozen outbreaks of various deadly infections. Large cities like Nuremberg and Augsburg might lose as much as a third to a half of their entire population during the one-to-two-year course of an especially severe epidemic. The most feared disease, though not necessarily the deadliest by this point, was the plague. Outbreaks of the plague became especially frequent in central Europe during Frantz Schmidt&#x2019;s lifetime&#x2014;occurring more often than at any other time or place in European history since the Black Death&#x2019;s first appearance in the mid-fourteenth century. They were also fearsomely capricious in their timing and their virulence.7 Individuals&#x2019; traumatic memories and experiences generated a shared cultural dread of all contagion, further underscoring the fragility of human life and the extent of individual vulnerability. <br>Floods, crop failures, and famines also struck at frequent&#x2014;though rarely predictable&#x2014;intervals. The Schmidts had the particular misfortune to live during the worst years of the period known to us as the Little Ice Age (c. 1400&#x2013;1700), when a global drop in year-round temperatures resulted in longer, harsher winters, and cooler, wetter summers, particularly in northern Europe. During Frantz Schmidt&#x2019;s lifetime, his native Franconia saw much more snow and rain than in previous years, resulting in flooded fields and crops left rotting in place. In some years there were not enough warm months for grapes to ripen, thus yielding only sour wine. Harvests produced desperately little, and the resulting famine left humans and their livestock prey to disease and starvation. Even wildlife populations shrank dramatically, with starving wolf packs increasingly turning their attention to human prey. The scarcity of all foodstuffs sent inflation soaring and, faced with starvation, many formerly law-abiding citizens turned to poaching and other stealing to feed themselves and their families.8 <br>Pummeled by natural forces beyond their control, the people of Frantz Schmidt&#x2019;s day also had to contend with the violence of other humans, particularly the seemingly ubiquitous bandits, soldiers, and assorted lawless men who roamed the land freely. Most territorial states, including the prince-bishopric of Bamberg and the imperial city of Nuremberg, mainly consisted of virgin forests and open meadows, dotted with tiny villages, a few towns of one to two thousand inhabitants, and one relatively large metropolis. Without the protection of city walls or concerned neighbors, an isolated farmhouse or mill lay at the mercy of just a few strong men with modest weapons. Well-traveled paths and country lanes often lay far from help as well. The roads and forests just outside a city, along with all border territories, were especially dangerous. There a traveler might fall prey to bandit gangs led by vicious outlaws such as Cunz Schott, who not only beat and robbed countless victims, but also made a point of collecting the hands of citizens from his self-declared enemy, Nuremberg.9 <br>The largest German state of the day was in fact&#x2014;as Voltaire later famously quipped&#x2014;neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire. Responsibility for law and order was instead divided among the empire&#x2019;s more than three hundred member states, which ranged in size from a baronial castle and its neighboring villages to vast territorial principalities, such as Electoral Saxony or the duchy of Bavaria. Seventy some imperial cities, such as Nuremberg and Augsburg, functioned as quasi-autonomous entities, while some abbots and bishops, including the prince-bishop of Bamberg, had long enjoyed secular as well as ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The emperor and his annual representative assembly (known as the Reichstag, or diet) provided a common focus of allegiance and held symbolic authority throughout German lands, but remained utterly powerless in preventing or resolving the feuds and wars that regularly broke out among member states. <br>Just two generations before Frantz Schmidt&#x2019;s birth, the reforming emperor Maximilian I more or less conceded the violent chaos that prevailed throughout his realm, proclaiming in his 1495 Perpetual Truce: <br>No one, whatever his rank, estate, or position, shall conduct feud, make war on, rob, kidnap, or besiege another&nbsp;&#x2026; nor shall he enter any castle town, market, fortress, villages, hamlets, or farms against another&#x2019;s will, or use force against them; illegally occupying them, threaten them with arson, or damage them in any other way.10 <br>In those days, feuding nobles and their entourages proved the greatest cause of unrest, conducting frequent small-scale raids against one another&#x2014;and in the process burning many rural inhabitants out of their homes and property. Worse still, some of these nobles freelanced as robber barons, running criminal rackets based on robbery, kidnapping, and extortion (commonly referred to as <i>Plackerei</i>), further terrorizing rural folk and travelers. <br>By the time of Frantz Schmidt, incessant feuding between noble families had largely ceased, thanks in equal measure to greater economic integration among the aristocracy and the rise of stronger princes.11 However, having consolidated their power in large states such as the duchy of W�rttemberg and the electorate of Brandenburg (later Prussia), these powerful princes now set out to conquer still more territory, using much of their considerable wealth to raise large armies of soldiers for hire. This thirst for war coincided with a steady decline in the number of nonmilitary jobs available to commoners during an exceptionally long period of inflation and high unemployment that historians have dubbed the long sixteenth century (c. 1480&#x2013;1620). The ranks of soldiers for pay accordingly ballooned twelvefold over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, spawning a terrifying new threat to personal safety and property in German lands: the universally despised landsknechts, or mercenaries. <br>One contemporary characterized landsknechts as &#x201c;a new order of soulless people [who] have no respect for honor or justice [and practice] whoring, adultery, rape, gluttony, drunkenness&nbsp;&#x2026; stealing, robbing, and murder,&#x201d; and who live &#x201c;entirely in the power of the devil, who pulls them about wherever he wants.&#x201d; Even the emperor Charles V, who relied heavily on such men, acknowledged the &#x201c;inhuman tyranny&#x201d; of the roving bands of landsknechts, which he considered &#x201c;more blasphemous and crueler than the Turks.&#x201d;12 While engaged, the mercenaries spent most of their time loitering in camps and sporadically pillaging the hinterlands of their contracted enemy&#x2014;perpetrating countless acts of small-scale localized violence like that captured chillingly in an episode from Hans Jakob Christoffel Grimmelshausen&#x2019;s seventeenth-century novel <i>Simplicissimus</i>: <br>A number of soldiers began to slaughter, to boil and roast things, while others, on the other hand, stormed through the house from top to bottom. Others still made a large pack out of linens, clothes, and all kinds of household goods. Everything they didn&#x2019;t want to take with them they destroyed. A number of them stuck their bayonets into the straw and hay, as if they didn&#x2019;t already have enough sheep and pigs to stick. Many of them shook out the feathers from the bedcovers and filled them with ham. Others threw meat and other utensils into them. Some knocked in the oven and the windows, smashing copper utensils and dishes. Bedsteads, tables, stools, and benches were burned. Pots and cutting boards were all broken. One servant girl was so badly handled in the barn that she couldn&#x2019;t move any longer. Our servant they tied up and laid on the ground and rammed a funnel in his mouth and then poured a ghastly brew full of piss down his throat. Then they started to torture the peasants as if they wanted to burn a bunch of witches.13 <br>Things were not much better in times of peace. When unemployed or simply unpaid (a frequent occurrence), some of these groups of mostly young men roved about the countryside in search of food, drink, and women (not necessarily in that order). Frequently joined by runaway servants and apprentices (known in England as &#x201c;ronnegates&#x201d;) as well as by debt-laden wife deserters, banished criminals, and other vagrants, these &#x201c;sturdy beggars&#x201d; survived mainly by panhandling and petty theft. Some became more aggressive, terrorizing farmers, villagers, and travelers with the same <i>Plackerei</i> as robber knights and professional bandits. The distinction between full-time and part-time extortionists and robbers was of course irrelevant to their many victims, as in the instance of two professional thieves flogged out of town by the adult Frantz Schmidt, who along with their companions, some begging mercenaries, <i>forced the people at three mills to give them goods and tortured [them], taking several hatchets and guns</i>.14 <br>Among the many crimes associated with robber bands and other roving ruffians, one struck special terror in the hearts of the rural populace: arson. In an era long before fire departments and home insurance, the very word was incendiary. One carefully placed torch could bring a farm or even an entire village to ruin, turning prosperous inhabitants into homeless beggars in less than an hour. In fact, the mere threat of burning down someone&#x2019;s house or barn&#x2014;often used as a form of extortion&#x2014;was considered tantamount to the deed itself and thus subject to the same prescribed punishment: being burned alive at the stake. Some gangs&#x2014;known as murderer-burners&#x2014;actually thrived on the extortion money they extracted from farmers and villagers threatened with this terrifying crime.15 Fear of professional arsonists was rampant in the German countryside, but most intentional house fires were the by-product of endemic private feuds and attempts at revenge, sometimes preceded by the warning figure of a red hen painted on a wall or a dreaded &#x201c;burn letter&#x201d; nailed to a front door. Fire prevention in most cities had advanced little since the ...</p><h2>Paths of Darkness, Collector&#39;s Edition (Forgotten Realms)</h2><p><b>A collection of four best-selling R.A.

After high school, the young man went to the rugged border area of Idaho, Oregon and Nevada and worked as a cow-puncher and handyman on several ranches. But his dream was evidently to become a 19th centurystyle mountain man and so he turned to poaching, often killing animals even though he had no need for the meat. In 1981, he killed two game wardens in front of a witness. On the run for 15 months, he was eventually captured in a shootout and found guilty of manslaughter in a singularly bizarre trial. The trial is well told, but the book as a whole is a disappointment from the author of such fine true crime tales as "Son" and The Man with the Candy. November 8<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.``Give a boy a gun and you're makin' a man,'' Claude Dallas, Sr., is quoted as saying in this book about his son, Claude Jr., a self-made cowboy, trapper, and ``mountain man'' who was convicted of manslaughter in the shooting deaths of two Idaho game wardens. Claude Jr. was well-liked by many, including a sympathetic jury which rejected possible first or second degree murder verdicts. Was it a case of self-defense or outright murder? Olsen, who last wrote the popular `` Son'': a psychopath and his victims ( LJ 11/15/83), skillfully presents his viewpoint in a readable tale more reminiscent of Old West traditions than of the 1980s.

How did her model of combative female leadership help shape the way we live now? How did the woman who won the Cold War and three general elections in succession find herself pushed out by her own MPs? Charles Moore&#39;s full account, based on unique access to Margaret Thatcher herself, her papers and her closest associates, tells the story of her last period in office, her combative retirement and the controversy that surrounded her even in death. It includes the Fall of the Berlin Wall which she had fought for and the rise of the modern EU which she feared. It lays bare her growing quarrels with colleagues and reveals the truth about her political assassination. Moore&#39;s three-part biography of Britain&#39;s most important peacetime prime minister paints an intimate political and personal portrait of the victories and defeats, the iron will but surprising vulnerability of the woman who dominated in an age of male power. This is the full, enthralling story.</p><p></p><h2>Buffalo Gals and Other Animal Presences</h2><p>Stories and poems deal with coyotes, lions, ants, cats, donkeys, horses, hawkes, plants, and rocks</p><p>A spirited, gracefully polemical introduction and the final story, "She Unnames Them," frame this collection of fiction and poetry, placing it in a natural but unsentimental light. These are not really "talking animal" stories: they are about human apprehension of natural creation (including rocks and plants) and the relations this apprehension governs; or, how communication makes communities. Seven of ten stories and seven of 19 poems having already been published, while a couple of pieces read like working drafts. Among the best pieces is the title story; like many of the others, it works its effect through a reversal of the usual (human) point of view.

Paul Zanker, a noted authority on Roman art and architecture, disentangles these tantalizing traces to show us the urban images that marked Pompeii's development from country town to Roman imperial city. Exploring Pompeii's public buildings, its streets and gathering places, we witness the impact of religious changes, the renovation of theaters and expansion of athletic facilities, and the influence of elite families on the city's appearance. Through these stages, Zanker adeptly conjures a sense of the political and social meanings in urban planning and public architecture.</p><p>The private houses of Pompeii prove equally eloquent, their layout, decor, and architectural detail speaking volumes about the life, taste, and desires of their owners.

Cover your arse. Regent&#39;s Park&#39;s First Desk, Claude Whelan, is learning this the hard way. Tasked with protecting a beleaguered prime minister, he&#39;s facing attack from all directions himself: from the showboating MP who orchestrated the Brexit vote, and now has his sights set on Number Ten; from the showboat&#39;s wife, a tabloid columnist, who&#39;s crucifying Whelan in print; and especially from his own deputy, Lady Di Taverner, who&#39;s alert for Claude&#39;s every stumble. Meanwhile, the country&#39;s being rocked by an apparently random string of terror attacks, and someone&#39;s trying to kill Roddy Ho. Over at Slough House, the crew are struggling with personal problems: repressed grief, various addictions, retail paralysis, and the nagging suspicion that their newest colleague is a psychopath. But collectively, they&#39;re about to rediscover their greatest strength - that of making a bad situation much, much worse. It&#39;s a good job Jackson Lamb knows the rules.

Mick Herron was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, and now lives in Oxford.The killers arrived in a sand-coloured jeep, and made short work of the village.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There were five of them and they wore mismatched military gear, two opting for black and the others for piebald variations. Neckerchiefs covered the lower half of their faces, sunglasses the upper, and their feet were encased in heavy boots, as if they&#x2019;d crossed the surrounding hills the hard way. From their belts hung sundry items of battleground kit. As the first emerged from the vehicle he tossed a water bottle onto the seat behind him, an action replicated in miniature in his aviator lenses.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was approaching noon, and the sun was as white as the locals had known it. Somewhere nearby, water tumbled over stones. The last time trouble had called here, it had come bearing swords.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the car, by the side of the road, the men stretched and spat. They didn&#x2019;t talk. They seemed in no hurry, but at the same time were focused on what they were doing. This was part of the operation: arrive, limber up, regain flexibility. They had driven a long way in the heat. No sense starting before they were in tune with their limbs and could trust their reflexes. It didn&#x2019;t matter that they were attracting attention, because nobody watching could alter what was to happen. Forewarned would not mean forearmed. All the villagers had were sticks.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One of these&#x2014;an ancient thing bearing many of the characteristics of its parent tree, being knobbled and imprecise, sturdy and reliable&#x2014;was leaned on by an elderly man whose weathered looks declared him farming stock. But somewhere in his history, perhaps, lurked a memory of war, for of all those watching the visitors perform their callisthenics he alone seemed to understand their intent, and into his eyes, already a little tearful from the sunshine, came both fear and a kind of resignation, as if he had always known that this, or something like it, would rear up and swallow him. Not far away, two women broke off from conversation. One held a cloth bag. The other&#x2019;s hands moved slowly towards her mouth. A barefoot boy wandered through a doorway into sunlight, his features crumpling in the glare. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the near distance a chain rattled as a dog tested its limits. Inside a makeshift coop, its mesh and wooden struts a patchwork of recycled materials, a chicken squatted to lay an egg no one would ever collect.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;From the back of their jeep the men fetched weapons, sleek and black and awful.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The last ordinary noise was the one the old man made when he dropped his stick. As he did so his lips moved, but no sound emerged.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And then it began.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> From afar,<b> </b>it might have been fireworks. In the surrounding hills birds took to the air in a frightened rattle, while in the village itself cats and dogs leaped for cover. Some bullets went wild, sprayed in indiscriminate loops and skirls, as if in imitation of a local dance; the chicken coop was blasted to splinters, and scars were chipped into stones that had stood unblemished for centuries. But others found their mark. The old man followed his stick to the ground, and the two women were hurled in opposite directions, thrown apart by nodules of lead that weighed less than their fingers. The barefoot boy tried to run. In the hillsides were tunnels carved into rock, and given time he might have found his way there, waited in the darkness until the killers had gone, but this possibility was blasted out of existence by a bullet that caught him in the neck, sending him cartwheeling down the short slope to the river, which was little more than a trickle today. The villagers caught in the open were scattering now, running into the fields, seeking shelter behind walls and in ditches; even those who hadn&#x2019;t seen what was happening had caught the fear, for catastrophe is its own herald, trumpeting its arrival to early birds and stragglers alike. It has a certain smell, a certain pitch. It sends mothers shrieking for their young, the old looking for God.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And two minutes later it was over, and the killers left. The jeep, which had idled throughout the brief carnage, spat stones as it accelerated away, and for a short while there was stillness. The sound of the departing engine folded into the landscape and was lost. A buzzard mewed overhead. Closer to home a gurgle sounded in a ruined throat, as someone struggled with a new language, whose first words were their last. And behind that, and then above it, and soon all around it, grew the screams of the survivors, for whom all familiar life was over, just as it was for the dead.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Within hours trucks would come bearing more men with guns, this time trained outwards, on the surrounding hillsides. Helicopters would land, disgorging doctors and military personnel, and others would fly overhead, crisscrossing the sky in orchestrated rage, while TV cameras pointed and blamed. On the streets shrouds would cover the fallen, and newly loosed chickens would wander by the river, pecking in the dirt. A bell would ring, or at least, people would remember it ringing. It might have been in their minds. But what was certain was that there would still be, above the buzzing helicopters, a sky whose blue remained somehow unbroken, and a distant buzzard mewing, and long shadows cast by the stunned Derbyshire hills.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>PART ONE</b><br> <b>COOL CATS</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In some parts of<b> </b>the world dawn arrives with rosy fingers, to smoothe away the creases left by night. But on Aldersgate Street, in the London borough of Finsbury, it comes wearing safecracker&#x2019;s gloves, so as not to leave prints on windowsills and doorknobs; it squints through keyholes, sizes up locks and generally cases the joint ahead of approaching day. Dawn specialises in unswept corners and undusted surfaces, in the nooks and chambers day rarely sees, because day is all business appointments and things being in the right place, while its younger sister&#x2019;s role is to creep about in the breaking gloom, never sure of what it might find there. It&#x2019;s one thing casting light on a subject. It&#x2019;s another expecting it to shine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So when dawn reaches Slough House&#x2014;a scruffy building whose ground floor is divided between an ailing Chinese restaurant and a desperate newsagent&#x2019;s, and whose front door, made filthy by time and weather, never opens&#x2014;it enters by the burglar&#x2019;s route, via the rooftops opposite, and its first port of call is Jackson Lamb&#x2019;s office, this being on the uppermost storey. Here it finds its only working rival a standard lamp atop a pile of telephone directories, which have so long served this purpose they have moulded together, their damp covers bonding in involuntary alliance. The room is cramped and furtive, like a kennel, and its overpowering theme is neglect. Psychopaths are said to decorate their walls with crazy writing, the loops and whorls of their infinite equations an attempt at cracking the code their life is hostage to. Lamb prefers his walls to do their own talking, and they have cooperated to the extent that the cracks in their plasterwork, their mildew stains, have here and there conspired to produce something that might amount to an actual script&#x2014;a scrawled observation, perhaps&#x2014;but all too quickly any sense these marks contain blurs and fades, as if they were something a moving finger had writ before deciding, contrary to the wisdom of ages, to rub out again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lamb&#x2019;s is not a room to linger in, and dawn, anyway, never tarries long. In the office opposite, it finds less to disturb it. Here order has prevailed, and there is a quiet efficiency about the way in which folders have been stacked, their edges squared off in alignment with the desktop, and the ribbons binding them tied in bows of equal length; about the emptiness of the wastepaper basket, and the dust-free surfaces of the well-mannered shelves. There is a stillness here out of keeping with Slough House, and if one were to seesaw between these two rooms, the bossman&#x2019;s lair and Catherine Standish&#x2019;s bolt-hole, a balance might be found that could bring peace to the premises, though one would imagine it would be short-lived.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As is dawn&#x2019;s presence in Catherine&#x2019;s room, for time is hurrying on. On the next level down is a kitchen. Dawn&#x2019;s favourite meal is breakfast, which is sometimes mostly gin, but either way it would find little to sustain it here, the cupboards falling very much on Scrooge&#x2019;s end of the Dickensian curve, far removed from Pickwickian excess. The cupboards contain no tins of biscuits, no jars of preserves, no emergency chocolate and no bowls of fruit or packets of crispbread mar the counter&#x2019;s surface; just odds and ends of plastic cutlery, a few chipped mugs and a surprisingly new-looking kettle. True, there is a fridge, but all it holds are two cans of energy drink, both stickered &#x201c;Roddy Ho,&#x201d; each of which rubric has had the words &#x201c;is a twat&#x201d; added, in different hands, and an uncontested tub of hummus, which is either mint-flavoured or has some other reason for being green. About the appliance hangs an odour best described as delayed decay. Luckily, dawn has no sense of smell.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Having briefly swept through the two offices on this floor&#x2014;nondescript rooms whose colour schemes can only be found in ancient swatches, their pages so faded, everything has subsided into shades of yellow and grey&#x2014;and taken care to skirt the dark patch beneath the radiator, where some manner of rusty leakage has occurred, it finds itself back on the staircase, which is old and rackety, dawn the only thing capable of using it without making a sound&#x2014;apart, that is, from Jackson Lamb, who when he feels like it can wander Slough House as silently as a newly conjured wraith, if rather more corpulent. At other times Lamb prefers the direct approach, and attacks the stairs with the noise that a bear pushing a wheelbarrow might make, if the wheelbarrow was full of tin cans, and the bear drunk.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;More watchful ghost than drunken bear, dawn arrives in the final two offices and finds little to distinguish them from those on the floor above, apart, perhaps, from the slightly stuccoed texture of the paintwork behind one desk, as if a fresh coat has been applied before the wall has been properly cleaned, and some lumpy matter has been left clinging to the plasterwork: best not to dwell on what this might be. For the rest, this office has the same air of frustrated ambition as its companions, and to one as sensitive as light-fingered dawn it contains, too, a memory of violence, and perhaps the promise of more to come. But dawn understands that promises are easily broken&#x2014;dawn knows all about breaking&#x2014;and the possibility delays it not one jot. On it goes, down the final set of stairs, and somehow passes through the back door without recourse to the shove this usually requires, the door being famously resistant to casual use. In the dank little yard behind Slough House dawn pauses, aware that its time is nearly up, and enjoys these last cool moments. Once upon a time it might have heard a horse making its way up the street; more recently, the happy hum of a milk float would have whiled away its final minute. But today there is only the scream of an ambulance, late for an appointment, and by the time its banshee howl has ceased bouncing off walls and buildings dawn has disappeared, and here in its place is the day itself, which, once within Slough House&#x2019;s grasp, turns out to be far from the embodiment of industry and occupation it threatened to be. Instead&#x2014;like the day before it, and the one before that&#x2014;it is just another slothful interlude to be clock watched out of existence, and knowing full well that none of the inhabitants can do anything to hasten its departure, it takes its own sweet time about setting up shop. Casually, smugly, unbothered by doubt or duty, it divides itself between Slough House&#x2019;s offices, and then, like a lazy cat, settles in the warmest corners to doze, while nothing much happens around it.</p><h2>The Sea of Monsters: The Graphic Novel (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 2)</h2><p>Seventh grade has been surprisingly quiet for Percy Jackson.

Mother Ocean still lay in shadow, her voice soft this morning, a bare purl of sound. White breakers pounded jagged rocks, then washed onto gravelly beaches. Offshore, fir-covered knobs of rock jutted from the wave-streaked water.Just to the north, along the precipitous shore, Waket's Nose--a spear of basalt--thrust up. Streamers of morning mist shredded on the mossy rock and drifted through the few stands of firs that had taken root in the steep sides.The grizzled warrior known as Red Dog scratched his bent nose and curiously studied the ancient Soul Keeper, Rides-the-Wind. The old man had seen more than five tens of summers. They must have been hard ones, for deep lines engraved his oblong face and crisscrossed his broad flat nose. His elkhide cape swayed in the fading starlight as he adjusted a set of sticks on the ground, moving them from one place to another."Elder," Red Dog bravely tried to interrupt for the third time, "Starwatcher Ecan sent me. I have urgent news.""Ecan considers his bodily functions to be urgent news," the old man snapped."Yes, Elder, but this is different. He--""Don't tell me this is different. I know him. I remember once,three summers ago, when his guards rushed in and pulled me from my robes. They dragged me kicking and scratching to his lodge. I was certain he'd ordered my death. It turned out he'd discovered a star-shaped object in his morning phlegm. He wanted me to kill the evil Spirit before it had a chance to leap back inside him." Rides-the-Wind arched a white eyebrow. "He's an imbecile. Imbecility runs in his family.""Well, perhaps, but--""Not yet." The old man aimed a crooked finger at Red Dog. "I'll tell you when I'm ready to listen."Red Dog gruffly folded his muscular arms and let his gaze drift to the small fire behind Rides-the-Wind. The hair-stuffed bodies of three toads perched on the hearthstones, where tendrils of smoke bathed them. What on earth did the old man use them for? Their bulging eyes seemed to be glaring right at him.Mist had just begun to form a tufted rime along the shore. Every now and then, he caught glimpses of orange fire bobbing out on the ocean--whale oil lamps, perched in the bows of fishing canoes. A few seagulls hunted along the surf, their calls shrill in the darkness.Rides-the-Wind moved another stick less than a fingernail's width from where it had been. In the bare breeze, his long gray hair and beard fluttered, rising around his wrinkled face as though alive.Red Dog shook his head. Only pure-blooded North Wind People had hair around their mouths. He'd never liked it. So far as he was concerned, beards had one use: soaking up soups and stews. Though his father had been one of the North Wind People, Red Dog thankfully looked more like the Raven People, who did not have beards."What are you doing, Elder?" Red Dog asked."You're blind, are you?""Well ... it didn't seem as though you moved your stick very far, so I was confused.""What does it look like I'm doing?"Red Dog frowned and followed the old man's gaze. The stony point was bare of the ever-present stands of fir and spruce. Rock cairns made black humps on the eastern horizon. The Star People rose along the line between the humps and the sticks he'd planted in the ground."Seeing where the Star People are rising?" Red Dog ventured a guess. "Which sounds a little silly to me. I mean, they rise in about the same place every day, don't they?"Rides-the-Wind tipped his antique face up. His brown eyes resembled stones under water, round and shiny. "You know, I thinkthat when Song Maker was pulling threads of sound from the heavens to Sing the world into existence, a few flat notes stuck in your soul.""Well, Elder"--What did a man say to that?--"I'm a warrior. My heart has different concerns. While your eyes are trained on the sky, mine are generally scanning the forest for people who might wish to kill me.""Given your ability to irritate people, your constant need for vigilance isn't surprising."As the Soul Keeper struggled to stand, Red Dog gripped his elbow and helped him up. Rides-the-Wind, though so much older, towered over him.The Soul Keeper waved a hand to indicate the mist-lashed cliffs. "This is a sacred place. The Star People often come down to earth on this very spot. On certain days, they dance on Waket's Nose. And if you are careful and observant, you can calculate when they will arrive because they move a little closer to us every day. Hence the sticks. Each morning I measure their approach."Red Dog scowled at the eastern horizon. Only a few Star People remained visible against the gleam of dawn. At death, the souls of North Wind people traveled to the Above Worlds, where they became stars. Soul Keepers, like Rides-the-Wind, spent their entire lives trying to seek the wisdom of those ancestors. Such elders never fought, or used a knife, no matter for what purpose, but dedicated their lives to seeing beyond this world.Red Dog asked, "Which one of our ancestors is planning on dropping out of the sky?"Rides-the-Wind lifted a gnarled finger and pointed. "That one. See how his hair is blowing out behind him? He's flying toward us very fast."It did look like long hair streamed out behind the Star Person. He glanced back at Rides-the-Wind. "When will he arrive?""When he wishes to. The Star People travel in far greater time circles than we do. I think it will take him a few moons. But when he arrives ..." Rides-the-Wind turned toward Waket's Nose; the rocky point jutted out over the water like a giant's beak. "He will soar down right there--at least, that's what my calculations indicate."Red Dog's eyes widened. Waket's Nose was noted for strange happenings. As a boy, Red Dog's own grandfather had seen one of the giants appear there. Grandfather had been canoeing with friends when the giant had stepped out onto Waket's Nose and leaped into the sea. They hadn't been able to see the giant's face, but as heplummeted into the water, his hands shook like a Dancer's. A tremendous splash rose when he hit Mother Ocean, nearly swamping his grandfather's canoe and hurling spray for hundreds of body lengths. Summers later, two women from Red Dog's clan had seen a huge mountain goat walking on the water at the exact spot where the giant dove into the ocean. When they stood up and gasped at the sight, a storm rose that overturned their canoe and drowned them. He'd heard the story from the very person onshore who'd seen it happen.Worried, Red Dog said, "I pray I am far away when the Star Person arrives."Rides-the-Wind gazed up at the deep blue sky. "Oh? You irritate him, too?""No, Elder, of course not, I--""Myself, I pray to be right here. I would give my very life to speak face-to-face with one of the Star People. The miracles they must see from up there. I can't even imagine."For a while, they just stared at the twinkling lights of the ancestors; then Rides-the-Wind heaved a breath and said, "Very well. What news do you bring from Fire Village?"The North Wind People--who had been here since Song Maker created the world--centered their affairs at Fire Village. There, the Four Old Women, the ruling Council, met, decided the law, and governed not only the North Wind People, but also the Raven People, upon whom they relied for tribute.Red Dog said, "Chief Cimmis sent me to tell you that the woman, Evening Star, is gone. Escaped from Ecan's lodge."Rides-the-Wind's dark eyes blazed. "Fools, you should have never meddled with her. She is more than you know." A pause. "Wasn't Ecan's young brother one of the guards assigned to her?""Kenada is dead, Starwatcher. She slit his throat with such vehemence she almost severed his head."For a time, Rides-the-Wind just stroked his long gray beard, as though deep in thought. He smiled warily. "Next you will tell me that Ecan has sent a pack of his mangy guards out after her.""Yes, Elder. Runners were sent immediately. I'm sure they've caught her by now, but Ecan orders you to curse her. He wants it done where the Raven People can see you do it. Just in case."The old man's withered mouth pinched. "Curse her? In a way that makes the Raven People fear to help her?""Yes, Elder. Exactly.""And just why should I do that?"Red Dog made an airy gesture. "Well, if you don't, Starwatcher Ecan will kill you."Rides-the-Wind closed his eyes and chuckled under his breath. "Humans. Such strange creatures. They forever remain a child in one part only: their fear of death. That's why they dwell on it. Death is the only thing in our lives that never fails to fill us with childlike wonder."Red Dog tucked a windblown lock of graying black hair behind his ear. Rides-the-Wind rarely made sense to him. "Which means ... what?"Rides-the-Wind gave him an annoyed look. "You wouldn't understand. When did the woman escape?""Two days ago. It has taken me that long to find Ecan, and then you. Oh, and Chief Cimmis orders you to return home immediately. He says that while Ecan is away leading the war party, he needs your services in Fire Village.""Ecan is leading a war party? He's the Starwatcher, a priest. Or has his appetite for the holy been subsumed by his appetite for blood and terror?""I don't know, Elder. All I can tell you is that the Four Old Women sent a war party to punish some North Wind People who incited disobedience among the Raven People villages.""You mean the <i>starving</i> people who defied Chief Cimmis's orders to turn over the tribute owed to Fire Village.""Yes.""The fools," Rides-the-Wind said softly. "They dance on the tip of Waket's Nose, not knowing how treacherous the footing is."Did he mean the Raven People? Or the Four Old Women who ran the Council? Red Dog cocked his head, but the Soul Keeper asked, "How long has Ecan been gone?""Perhaps ten days."Wind Mother rushed up the slope and beat her way through the twisted spruce and fir growing at the edge of the cliffs. Their sweet evergreen fragrance bathed Red Dog's face and carried the damp scent of the sea."It is the beginning of the end." Rides-the-Wind shivered, tugged his elkhide hood up, and held it closed beneath his chin."The end of what?" Red Dog asked.Rides-the-Wind didn't seem to hear, but added, "Tell Cimmis that I'm not coming. I wish to be left alone."Red Dog examined him in detail. "Are you ill, Elder?"Rides-the-Wind gave him a look that would have withered polished stone. "Why? Did you become a Healer while I was away?""Uh ... no."Red Dog chewed his lower lip. Over the past sun cycle, Ecan had become the most powerful holy man in the North Wind Nation--mostly because he enthusiastically supported the Council's decisions to make war upon the Raven People. Rides-the-Wind, on the other hand, had opposed the Council, and had abruptly left Fire Village just after fall equinox. Was it because he'd seen his influence dwindle, and he couldn't stand the humiliation?"What should I tell Chief Cimmis about the woman? Will you curse her for Ecan?""On the contrary." Rides-the-Wind reached down for his walking stick where it rested on the ground near the Star sticks. He propped both hands on the use-polished knob. "I will be praying night and day for her safety."Red Dog shifted uncomfortably. "Well, prayers aside, I don't see how she can be. Once people discover she's Ecan's escaped slave, no one will dare to help her."In the furred frame of his hood, Rides-the-Wind's seamed old face resembled a dried berry. He turned to his fire, picked up his smoked toads, and gently placed them into his pack. Finally, he reached down and plucked a small stone from the ground, holding it up for Red Dog to see."Tell Chief Cimmis that I have a message for him. He stands on the precipice ... and if he doesn't watch his step, he and Ecan are going to fall. The drop will cost him everything he holds dear."With that, the old man pitched the stone out, over the cliff. In the purple light, it arced down, shattering into slivers as it struck the rock below.Copyright � 2004 by Kathleen O'Neal Gear and W.

It contains information on the materials and preparation you will need to capture the delicacy and majesty of the subjects.<br><br> * Twenty-six striking and characterful bird species<br> * Clear and easy-to-follow step by step projects<br> * Includes guidance on composition, reference and important bird features</p><p>Andrew Forkner is a keen naturalist and has travelled the world in search of wildlife. His artwork has also travelled widely, with examples of his art in collections in the UK, Europe, Kenya, Canada, USA and Nepal. A self-taught wildlife artist, he works in a variety of media, including graphite pencil, acrylics and pastel to complete his originals. Andrew lives in Oxfordshire. Andrew is a signature member of The Artists for Conservation Foundation and also a member of The Wildlife Art Society International. He has produced several commissions for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, of which he has been a member for over thirty years.February 2015 Andrew Forkner's A-Z of Bird Portraits shows you how to set about capturing 26 birds in acrylics, with guidance on composition and important bird features. The clear and easy-to-follow step-by-step projects include plenty of annotated drawings and detailed colour mixes, allowing you to concentrate on the bird themselves. * Leisure Painter, The * February 2015 Art books like this one by Andrew Forkner's provide cake decorator's with great inspiration particularly when painting cakes, or producing lifelike wildlife to portray the cake recipient's hobbies and interests. This book provides you with all you need to paint a range of birds; taking in birds of prey, songbirds and waterbirds from all over the world. With easy-to-follow step by step projects, guidance on composition and important bird features. * Cake Craft &amp; Decoration * December 2014 As a concept art lecturer I look at a number of books and must admit this one intrigued me. The first impression I had was colour and life and this stuck with me as I followed the book. This feels like a natural history tour while explaining the proportions and colours for each bird and makes wanting to draw and paint each of the birds a natural progression. My only concern is that I might get paint on the pages! * Marian Carr, Bradford College * November 2014 For painters and bird lovers everywhere. Great book with all you need to know to paint twenty-seven different bird species. Andrew uses acrylics, both as watercolour and in their natural state. He shows you how to capture features, characteristics and feathers. The instructions are clear, detailed and easy to follow. Outlines to trace, colour palette, materials needed, professional techniques and tips are all included. Beautifully illustrated. My favourite feature is that you also learn something about the birds including their latin names. Absolutely fabulous and highly recommended. * Karen Platt Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts * November 2014 Have you always wanted to paint lifelike pictures of birds? Inside these covers are staged instructions on how to paint twenty-seven of them in acrylics. You know when Search Press gives a book a hard cover instead of a paper one to expect something special and this is no exception. Self taught wildlife artist Andrew Forkner sets out his love of birds and acrylics in a user friendly manner, ranging from what you need to buy to painting tips. Learn how to capture feathers on paper as well as birds; feet and beaks, get to grips with the unique properties of acrylics and think about how to compose your picture. Each project has a drawing to trace with instructions on how to do this, plus what paint and brushes to use and even the type of paper. This is not a step-by-step book in the usual Search Press sense as the instructions are remarkably brief. But it does not state anywhere that this is a beginner's book and it is not; aimed more at existing artists who want to try their hand at using acrylics and painting birds. There is a wide choice of these to paint, with British and American species being the main ones represented. Choose from favourites like a golden eagle, robin, kookaburra, bald eagle and mourning dove to name a few; the ends results are handsomely displayed as whole page illustrations in this large format book. This ought to appeal to any bird lover with a bit of painting experience who wants to try something new. * Myshelf.com * November 2014 There aren't many books on painting birds. The reason, of course, isn't hard to find: not many people want (or think they want) to paint them. They do, however, provide a wide variety of colourful subjects and there's no reason in reality for them to be any less popular than flowers. And you can't move for books on flowers. Andrew Forkner adopts the sensible strategy of putting all the basic techniques (working in acrylics) together at the beginning of the book. These include information on colours, composition, eyes, beaks and, most importantly, feathers. These are the building blocks you'll use later when it comes to particular species. The approach avoids continuous repetition, but it does mean a degree of jumping about if you haven't fully grasped the technical elements - which, frankly, you should have. Time spent at this stage is like learning musical scales, unexciting perhaps, but invaluable. The whole thing is neatly executed and is about as good, within its own constraints, as it could be. The A-Z format has worked before, but that was for flowers, and it's just that I'm not sure this is the place for it. Flowers are popular and well-known. Bird are, too, but I doubt there are enough people who both admire them and want to paint them for something like this to work. It's not, when all's said and done, a book for the complete beginner and I do honestly think that's what's needed. On the other hand, if you're passionate about painting birds but need practice and instruction, this is absolutely the book for you.

Juan de Vere, nearly finished with his university degree, takes a job as personal assistant to Eduardo Muriel, an eccentric, once-successful film director. Urbane, discreet, irreproachable, Muriel is an irresistible idol to the young man. But Muriel's voluptuous wife, Beatriz, inhabits their home like an unwanted ghost; and on the periphery of their lives is Dr. Jorge Van Vechten, a family friend implicated in unsavory rumors that Muriel now asks Juan to investigate. As Juan draws closer to the truth, he uncovers only more questions. What is at the root of Muriel's hostility toward his wife? How did Beatriz meet Van Vechten? What happened during the war? Mar�as leads us deep into the intrigues of these characters, through a daring exploration of rancor, suspicion, loyalty, trust, and the infinitely permeable boundaries between the deceptions perpetrated on us by others and those we inflict upon ourselves.</p><p><b>JAVIER MAR�AS</b> was born in Madrid in 1951. The recipient of numerous prizes, including the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and the Prix Femina �tranger, he has written fourteen novels, three story collections, and twenty works of collected articles and essays. His books have been translated into forty-three languages, in fifty-five countries, and have sold more than eight million copies throughout the world.<br><br>Translated from the Spanish by Margaret Jull Costa.Eduardo Muriel had a thin moustache, as if he had first grown it when the actor Errol Flynn was still around and had then forgotten to change it or allow it to grow more thickly, one of those men of fixed habits as regards his appearance, the kind who doesn&#x2019;t notice that time passes and fashions change nor that he himself is growing older&#x2014; it&#x2019;s as if time did not concern him and so could be discounted, rendering him immune to its passing&#x2014;and up to a point he was right not to worry about it or to pay it any attention: by attaching no importance to his age, he kept it at bay; by not giving in to it in external matters, he rejected it, and so the timid passing years&#x2014;which make bold with almost everyone else&#x2014;prowled and stalked, but didn&#x2019;t dare to claim him, did not take root in his mind or affect his appearance, merely casting upon it a very slow shower of sleet or shadow. He was tall, well above average height for a man of his generation, the generation just after my father&#x2019;s or possibly the same one. At first glance, his height made him seem strong and slim, although he didn&#x2019;t exactly conform to the manly stereotype: he had rather narrow shoulders, which made his belly seem larger, even though he carried no excess fat there or on his hips, from which emerged a pair of very long legs that he didn&#x2019;t know quite what to do with when he sat down: if he crossed them (and that, generally speaking, was his preferred position), the foot of the upper leg easily touched the floor, a pose also achieved&#x2014;albeit by artificial means and with the aid of foreshortening and high heels&#x2014;by certain women who are particularly proud of their calves and who prefer not to leave one leg dangling free or to become pushed out of shape by the supporting knee. Because of his narrow shoulders, Muriel used to wear jackets with carefully disguised shoulder pads, I think, or perhaps his&nbsp;tailor cut them in the form of an inverted trapezium (in the 1970s and 1980s, he still went to see his tailor or his tailor came to him, which was unusual even then). He had a very straight nose, with not a trace of a curve despite its good size, and his thick, predominantly dark brown hair (parted with a wet comb as doubtless his mother had done ever since he was a child&#x2014;a tradition he had seen no reason to break with) had a sprinkling of grey. His thin moustache did little to diminish his bright, spontaneous, youthful smile. He tried to restrain that smile or repress it, but often failed, because there was in him an underlying spirit of joviality, or a past self that emerged easily and without the need to send a sounding line down very deep. Nor, on the other hand, was it to be found in very shallow waters, for in those there floated a certain bitterness, either habitual or unconscious, of which he felt he was not the cause, but possibly the victim.<br>The most striking thing about him, though, when one saw him for the first time or came across a rare full-face photo in the newspaper, was the patch he wore over his right eye, a classic, theatrical or even filmic eyepatch, black and bulky and held in place by a thin black piece of elastic. I have always wondered why such eyepatches have a rough surface, I don&#x2019;t mean the cloth ones intended only as temporary protection, but the permanent, fitted ones made of some stiff, compact material. (It looked like Bakelite, and I often felt tempted to drum on it with my fingernails to find out how it felt, not that I ever tried this with my employer; I did, however, find out what it sounded like, because sometimes, when he was upset or irritated, but also whenever he paused to think before uttering a sentence or embarking on a speech, with his thumb tucked under one armpit as if it were the tiny riding whip of a soldier or a cavalryman reviewing his troops or his mounts, Muriel did exactly that, drumming on his eyepatch with the fingernails of his free hand, as if summoning the aid of his non-existent or useless eye; he must have liked the sound it made and it was rather pleasing, toc, toc, toc; although until one got used to the gesture it did make one cringe slightly, to see him invoking his absent eye.) Perhaps the somewhat bulky shape of the patch is intended to give the impression that there is an actual eye underneath, when there might only be an empty socket, a&nbsp;hollow, a dent, a depression. Perhaps those patches are convex precisely in order to contradict the awful concavity that, in some cases, they conceal; who knows, perhaps the cavity is filled by a polished sphere of white glass or marble, with the pupil and the iris painted on with pointless, perfect realism, an eye that will never be seen, always covered in black, or seen only by its owner at the end of the day, when, standing before the mirror, he wearily uncovers or perhaps removes it.<br><br>And while the patch inevitably drew one&#x2019;s attention, his useful, visible eye, the left one, was no less striking, being of an intense dark blue, like the sea at evening or perhaps at night, and which, because it was alone, seemed to notice and register absolutely everything, as if it possessed both its own faculties and those of the other invisible, blind eye, or as though nature had wanted to compensate for the loss of its pair by making it more than usually penetrating. Such was the energy and speed of the left eye that I would, gradually and furtively, try to place myself out of its reach so as not to be wounded by its piercing gaze, until Muriel would tell me off: &#x201c;Move a little to the right, I can barely see you there unless I lean sideways. Don&#x2019;t forget, my field of vision is more limited than yours.&#x201d; And at first, when I didn&#x2019;t know where to look&#x2014;torn between that living, maritime eye and the dead, magnetic patch&#x2014;he would have no hesitation in calling me to order: &#x201c;Juan, I&#x2019;m talking to you with the seeing eye, not the dead one, so please listen and don&#x2019;t get distracted by the eye that isn&#x2019;t saying a word.&#x201d; Muriel would openly refer to his halved vision, unlike those who draw an awkward veil of silence over any personal defect or disability, however conspicuous and dramatic: people who have had one arm amputated at the shoulder, but who never acknowledge the difficulties they face and do just about everything short of taking up juggling; one-legged people who scale Annapurna on crutches; blind people who go to the cinema and then make a fuss during the scenes with no dialogue, complaining that the image is out of focus; disabled people who pretend they&#x2019;re not wheelchair-bound and insist on trying to climb stairs rather than using the ramps that are available everywhere nowadays; men with heads like billiard balls, who, whenever there&#x2019;s a gust of wind, are constantly smoothing their non-existent hair and getting frustrated with&nbsp;their imaginary unruly mop. (Not that I&#x2019;m criticizing them in the least, of course, they&#x2019;re free to do exactly as they like.)<br>But the first time I asked him what had happened to his eye, how his silent eye had been struck dumb, he replied as brusquely as he did sometimes to people who annoyed him, although he rarely did so with me, for he usually treated me with great kindness and affection: &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get one thing straight: I don&#x2019;t employ you to ask me questions about matters that are none of your business.&#x201d;</p><h2>How to Train Your Dragon: How to Break a Dragon&#39;s Heart (Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III)</h2><p>Stranded on the exceptionally dangerous, and possibly haunted, Beach of the Broken Heart, Hiccup must face Ug the Uglithug and complete the Impossible Task--or die trying.

In his groundbreaking book, <i>Disintegration</i>, Pulitzer-Prize winning columnist Eugene Robinson argues that over decades of desegregation, affirmative action, and immigration, the concept of Black America has shattered. Instead of one black America, now there are four:<br><br>� a Mainstream middle-class majority with a full ownership stake in American society; <br><br>� a large, Abandoned minority with less hope of escaping poverty and dysfunction than at any time since Reconstruction&#x2019;s crushing end; <br>� a small Transcendent elite with such enormous wealth, power, and influence that even white folks have to genuflect; <br><br>� and two newly Emergent groups&#x2014;individuals of mixed-race heritage and communities of recent black immigrants&#x2014;that make us wonder what &#x201c;black&#x201d; is even supposed to mean.<br><br>Robinson shows that the four black Americas are increasingly distinct, separated by demography, geography, and psychology. They have different profiles, different mindsets, different hopes, fears, and dreams. What&#x2019;s more, these groups have become so distinct that they view each other with mistrust and apprehension. And yet all are reluctant to acknowledge division. <br><i><br>Disintegration</i> offers a new paradigm for understanding race in America, with implications both hopeful and dispiriting. It shines necessary light on debates about affirmative action, racial identity, and the ultimate question of whether the black community will endure.</p><p><b>EUGENE ROBINSON</b> joined the <i>Washington Post</i> in 1980, where he has served as London bureau chief, foreign editor, and, currently, associate editor and columnist. He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard, and in 2009, Robinson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary. <i>Disintegration</i> is his third book.1<br><br>"BLACK AMERICA" DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE<br><br>It was one of those only-in-Washington affairs, a glittering A-list dinner in a stately mansion near Embassy Row. The hosts were one of the capital's leading power couples--the husband a wealthy attorney who famously served as consigliere and golfing partner to presidents, the wife a social doyenne who sat on all the right committees and boards. The guest list included enough bold-faced names to fill the <i>Washington Post</i>'s Reliable Source gossip column for a solid week. Most of the furniture had been cleared away to let people circulate, but the elegant rooms were so thick with status, ego, and ambition that it was hard to move.<br><br>Officially the dinner was to honor an aging lion of American business: the retired chief executive of the world's biggest media and entertainment company. Owing to recent events, however, the distinguished mogul was eclipsed at his own party. An elegant businesswoman from Chicago--a stranger to most of the other guests--suddenly had become one of the capital's most important power brokers, and this exclusive soiree was serving as her unofficial debut in Washington society. The bold-faced names feigned nonchalance but were desperate to meet her. Eyes followed the woman's every move; ears strained to catch her every word. She pretended not to mind being stalked from room to room by eager supplicants and would-be best friends. As the evening went on, it became apparent that while the other guests were taking her measure, she was systematically taking theirs. To every beaming, glad-handing, air-kissing approach she responded with the Mona Lisa smile of a woman not to be taken lightly.<br><br>Others there that night included a well-connected lawyer who would soon be nominated to fill a key cabinet post; the chief executive of one of the nation's leading cable-television networks; the former chief executive of the mortgage industry's biggest firm; a gaggle of high-powered lawyers; a pride of investment bankers; a flight of social butterflies; and a chattering of well-known cable-television pundits, slightly hoarse and completely exhausted after spending a full year in more or less continuous yakety-yak about the presidential race. By any measure, it was a top-shelf crowd.<br><br>On any given night, of course, some gathering of the great and the good in Washington ranks above all others by virtue of exclusivity, glamour, or the number of Secret Service SUVs parked outside. What makes this one worth noting is that all the luminaries I have described are black.<br><br>The affair was held at the home of Vernon Jordan, the smooth, handsome, charismatic confidant of Democratic presidents, and his wife, Ann, an emeritus trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and a reliable presence at every significant social event in town. Known for his impeccable political instincts, Jordan had made the rare mistake of backing the wrong candidate in the 2008 primaries&#x2014;his friend Hillary Clinton. There are no grudges in Vernon's world, however; barely a week after the election, he was already skillfully renewing his ties with the Obama crowd.<br><br>The nominal guest of honor was Richard Parsons, the former CEO of Time Warner Inc. Months earlier, he had relinquished his corner office on Columbus Circle to tend the Tuscan vineyard that friends said was the favorite of his residences.<br><br>The woman who stole the show was Valerie Jarrett, one of Obama's best friends and most trusted advisers. A powerful figure in the Chicago business community, Jarrett was unknown in Washington until Obama made his out-of-nowhere run to capture the Democratic nomination and then the presidency. Suddenly she was the most talked-about and sought- after woman in town. Everyone understood that she would be sitting on the mother lode of the capital's rarest and most precious asset: access to the president of the United States.<br><br>Others sidling up to the buffet included Eric Holder, soon to be nominated as the nation's first black attorney general, and his wife, Sharon Malone, a prominent obstetrician; Debra Lee, the longtime chief of Black Entertainment Television and one of the most powerful women in the entertainment industry; Franklin Raines, the former CEO of Fannie Mae, a central and controversial figure in the financial crisis that had begun to roil markets around the globe; and cable-news regulars Donna Brazile and Soledad O'Brien from CNN, Juan Williams from Fox News Channel, and, well, me from MSNBC--all of us having talked so much during the long campaign that we were sick of hearing our own voices.<br><br>The glittering scene wasn't at all what most people have in mind when they talk about black America-which is one reason why so much of what people say about black America makes so little sense. The fact is that asking what something called "black America" thinks, feels, or wants makes as much sense as commissioning a new Gallup poll of the Ottoman Empire. Black America, as we knew it, is history.<br>***<br><br>There was a time when there were agreed-upon "black leaders," when there was a clear "black agenda," when we could talk confidently about "the state of black America"-but not anymore. Not after decades of desegregation, affirmative action, and urban decay; not after globalization decimated the working class and trickle-down economics sorted the nation into winners and losers; not after the biggest wave of black immigration from Africa and the Caribbean since slavery; not after most people ceased to notice--much less care--when a black man and a white woman walked down the street hand in hand. These are among the forces and trends that have had the unintended consequence of tearing black America to pieces.<br><br>Ever wonder why black elected officials spend so much time talking about purely symbolic "issues," like an official apology for slavery? Or why they never miss the chance to denounce a racist outburst from a rehab-bound celebrity? It's because symbolism, history, and old- fashioned racism are about the only things they can be sure their African American constituents still have in common.<br><br>Barack Obama's stunning election as the first African American president seemed to come out of nowhere, but it was the result of a transformation that has been unfolding for decades. With implications both hopeful and dispiriting, black America has undergone a process of disintegration.<br><br>Disintegration isn't something black America likes to talk about. But it's right there, documented in census data, economic reports, housing patterns, and a wealth of other evidence just begging for honest analysis. And it's right there in our daily lives, if we allow ourselves to notice. Instead of one black America, now there are four:<br><br>* a Mainstream middle-class majority with a full ownership stake in American society<br><br>* a large, Abandoned minority with less hope of escaping poverty and dysfunction than at any time since Reconstruction's crushing end<br><br>* a small Transcendent elite with such enormous wealth, power, and influence that even white folks have to genuflect<br><br>* two newly Emergent groups-individuals of mixed-race heritage and communities of recent black immigrants-that make us wonder what "black" is even supposed to mean<br><br>These four black Americas are increasingly distinct, separated by demography, geography, and psychology. They have different profiles, different mind-sets, different hopes, fears, and dreams. There are times and places where we all still come back together--on the increasingly rare occasions when we feel lumped together, defined, and threatened solely on the basis of skin color, usually involving some high-profile instance of bald-faced discrimination or injustice; and in venues like "urban" or black-oriented radio, which serves as a kind of speed-of-light grapevine. More and more, however, we lead separate lives.<br><br>And where these distinct "nations" rub against one another, there are sparks. The Mainstream tend to doubt the authenticity of the Emergent, but they're usually too polite, or too politically correct, to say so out loud. The Abandoned accuse the Emergent--the immigrant segment, at least--of moving into Abandoned neighborhoods and using the locals as mere stepping-stones. The immigrant Emergent, with their intact families and long-range mind-set, ridicule the Abandoned for being their own worst enemies. The Mainstream bemoan the plight of the Abandoned--but express their deep concern from a distance. The Transcendent, to steal the old line about Boston society, speak only to God; they are idolized by the Mainstream and the Emergent for the obstacles they have overcome, and by the Abandoned for the shiny things they own. Mainstream, Emergent, and Transcendent all lock their car doors when they drive through an Abandoned neighborhood. They think the Abandoned don't hear the disrespectful <i>thunk </i>of the locks; they're wrong.<br><br>How did this breakup happen? It's overly simplistic to draw a straight line from "We Shall Overcome" to "Get Rich or Die Tryin'," but that's the general trajectory.<br><br>Forty years ago, after major cities from coast to coast had gone up in flames, black equaled poor. Roughly six in ten black Americans were barely a step ahead of the bill collector, with fully 40 percent of the total living in the abject penury that the Census Bureau officially labels "poverty" and another 20 percent earning a bit more but still basically poor. Over the next three decades--as civil rights laws banned discrimination in education, housing, and employment, and as affirmative action offered life-changing opportunities to those prepared to take advantage--millions of black households clawed their way into the Mainstream and the black poverty rate fell steadily, year after year. By the mid-'90s, it was down to 25 percent--and then the needle got stuck. Today, roughly one-quarter of black Americans-the Abandoned-remain in poverty.(1)<br><br>And the poorest of these poor folks are actually losing ground. In 2000, 14.9 percent of black households reported income of less than $10,000 (in today's dollars); in 2005, the figure was 17.1 percent.(2) Demographically, the Abandoned constitute the youngest black America; they are also by far the least suburban, living for the most part in core urban neighborhoods and the rural South.<br><br>Those who made it into the Mainstream, however, have continued their rise. In 1967, only one black household in ten made $50,000 a year; now three of every ten black families earn at least that much. More strikingly, four decades ago not even <i>two black households in a hundred</i>earned the equivalent of more than $100,000 a year. Now almost one black household in ten has crossed that threshold to the upper middle class--joining George and Louise Jefferson in that "dee-luxe apartment in the sky," perhaps, or living down the street from the Huxtables' handsomely appointed brownstone. All told, the four black Americas control an estimated $800 billion in purchasing power--roughly the GDP of the thirteenth-richest nation on earth. Most of that money is made and spent by the Mainstream.(3)<br><br>Here's another way to look at it: Forty years ago, if you found yourself among a representative all-black crowd, you could assume that nearly half the people around you were poor, poorly educated, and underemployed. Today, if you found yourself at a representative gathering of black adults, four out of five would be solidly middle class.<br><br>And some African Americans have soared far higher. A friend of mine who lives in Chicago once took a flight on the Tribune Company's corporate jet. Noticing a much larger, newer, fancier private jet parked on the tarmac nearby, he asked his boss whose it was. The answer: "Oprah's." The all-powerful Winfrey is one of the African Americans who have soared highest of all, into the realm of the Transcendent. There have long been black millionaires--Madam C. J. Walker, who built an empire on hair-care products in the early twentieth century, is often cited as the first. But never before have African Americans presided as full-fledged Masters of the Universe over some of the biggest firms on Wall Street (Richard Parsons, Kenneth Chenault, Stanley O'Neal). There have been wealthy black athletes since Jack Johnson, but never before have they transformed themselves into such savvy tycoons (Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods). And while African Americans have made billions for the music industry over the years, even pioneers such as Berry Gordy Jr. and Quincy Jones never owned and controlled as big a chunk of the business as today's hip-hop moguls (Russell Simmons, P. Diddy, Jay-Z).<br><br>And the Emergent? They're the product of two separate phenomena. First, there has been a flood of black immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean. In 1980, the census reported 816,000 foreign-born black people in the United States; by the 2000 census, that figure had more than tripled to 2,815,000.(4) You might question my use of the word "flood" for numbers that seem relatively small in absolute terms, but consider these newcomers' outsize impact: Half or more of the black students entering elite universities such as Harvard, Princeton, and Duke these days are the sons and daughters of African immigrants.(5) This makes sense when you consider that their parents are the best- educated immigrant group in America, with more advanced degrees than the Asians, the Europeans, you name it. (They're far better educated than native-born Americans, black or white.) But their children's educational success leads Mainstream and Abandoned black Americans to ask whether affirmative action and other programs designed to foster diversity are reaching the people they were intended to help--the systematically disadvantaged descendants of slaves.<br><br>The second Emergent phenomenon is the acceptance of interracial marriage, once a crime and until recently a novelty. A University of Michigan study found that in 1990, nearly one married black man in ten was wed to a white woman-and roughly one married black woman in twenty-five was wed to a white man. These figures, the researchers found, had increased eightfold over the previous four decades.(6) Barack Obama, the man who would be president; Adrian Fenty, the mayor of Washington, D.C.; Jordin Sparks, a winner on <i>American Idol</i>--all are the product of black-white marriages. And the boomer-echo generation, raised on a diet of diversity, has even fewer hang-ups about race and relationships.<br><br>In a sense, though, we're just headed back to the future. Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. recently produced a public-television series in which he used genealogical research and DNA testing to unearth the heritage of several prominent African Americans. When he sent his own blood off to be tested, Gates discovered to his surprise that more than 50 percent of his genetic material was European. Wider DNA testing has shown that nearly one-third of all African Americans trace their heritage to a white male ancestor--likely a slave owner.<br><br>So forget about whether the mixed-race Emergents are "black enough." How black am I? How black can any of us claim to be?<br><br>So forget about whether the mixed-race Emergents are "black enough." How black am I?

Dodd and Joachim Jeremias set the direction for nearly all further parable studies in this century. Embodied in both scholar&#39;s approaches are at least two assumptions that, for the most part, have gone unchallenged: (1) Parables make one and only one main point. (2) They are not allegories. But can these assumptions be supported by the evidence? In this introductory text, Craig Blomberg surveys and evaluates contemporary critical approaches to the parables, challenging the prevailing consensus and making his own important new contribution to parable studies. Within proper definitions and limits, he argues, the parables are in fact best seen as allegories. In support of his thesis, he not only sets forth theoretical considerations but devotes attention to all the major parables, providing brief interpretations that highlight the insights to be gained from his distinctive method. A concluding chapter examines the implications of the parables for Christology and our understanding of the kingdom of God. This groundbreaking book will be of value not only to students but to pastors and other serious readers of Scripture.</p><p>"<em>Interpreting the Parables</em> will appeal to theological students as what will, I suspect, become the standard evangelical textbook on the subject . . . much superior to its rivals."

Their ostensible purpose was to have the five participate in the festivities attendant on the celebration of the fiftieth year of the reign of Ailell, the High King. In fact, there were darker premonitions underlying the mage&#x2019;s actions.</p> <p>In Brennin, a brutal drought was afflicting the kingdom. Ailell&#x2019;s older son, Aileron, had already been exiled for cursing his father&#x2019;s refusal to allow him to sacrifice himself on the Summer Tree in an effort to end the drought.</p> <p>In Fionavar, the five strangers quickly found themselves drawn into the complex tapestry of events. Kim Ford was recognized by the aged Seer, Ysanne, as the successor she had prophetically dreamt. Kim was initiated into the knowledge of the Seers by the water spirit, Eilathen, and presented with the Baelrath, the &#x201c;Warstone&#x201d; that Ysanne had been guarding. Kim was also shown the Circlet of Lisen, a gem that shone with its own light. The beautiful Lisen, a power of Pendaran Wood, had been the magical source and the beloved companion of Amairgen Whitebranch, the first of the mages. She had killed herself, leaping into the sea from her Tower, upon learning that Amairgen had died. Ysanne told Kim the prophecy that accompanied the Circlet: &#x201c;Who shall wear this next, after Lisen, shall have the darkest road to walk of any child of earth or stars.&#x201d; Later, as a last gesture of ultimate sacrifice on the eve of war, Ysanne, knowing Kim would have need of the old Seer&#x2019;s power in the days to come, used L�kdal, the magic dagger of the Dwarves, to kill herself&#x2014;but not before tracing a symbol on the brow of the sleeping Kim, which action enabled her to make of her own soul a gift for Kimberly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Paul Schafer and Kevin Laine were initiated in quite a different way. Paul played&#x2014;and lost&#x2014;a night game of chess with the High King in the palace of Paras Derval, during which an unexpected bond of sympathy was forged between the two. The next morning he and Kevin joined the band of the reckless Prince Diarmuid, Ailell&#x2019;s younger son, in a raid across the River Saeren to Cathal, the Garden Country. There, Diarmuid achieved his intended seduction of Sharra, the Princess of Cathal. After the company&#x2019;s return to Brennin, they passed a wild night in the Black Boar tavern. Late at night a song Kevin sang reminded Paul too acutely of the death in a car accident of Rachel Kincaid, the woman he had loved. Paul, blaming himself for the accident, which had occurred moments after Rachel had announced she was going to wed someone else, took a drastic step: he approached the High King and received Ailell&#x2019;s sanction to sacrifice himself in the King&#x2019;s stead on the Summer Tree.</p> <p>The next night, the glade of the Summer Tree in the Godwood saw an epic battle. As Paul, bound on the Tree, watched helplessly, Galadan the Wolflord, who had come to claim Paul&#x2019;s life, was opposed and driven back by a mysterious grey dog. The following night&#x2014;Paul&#x2019;s third on the Tree&#x2014;a red full moon shone in the sky on a new moon night, as Dana, the Mother Goddess, granted Paul release from his guilt, by showing that he had not, in fact, subconsciously willed the accident that had killed Rachel. As Paul wept, rain finally fell over Brennin. Paul, though, did not die. He was taken down from the Tree alive by Jaelle, the High Priestess of Dana. Henceforth Paul would carry another name: Pwyll Twiceborn, Lord of the Summer Tree.</p> <p>By now it was clear that an epochal confrontation was at hand: Rakoth Maugrim, the Unraveller, defeated a thousand years before and bound under the great mountain, Rangat, had freed himself and had caused the mountain to explode with a hand of fire to proclaim that fact.</p> <p>His freedom was to have immediate consequences for Jennifer Lowell, the fourth of the strangers. In Paras Derval she had witnessed an unsettling incident during a children&#x2019;s counting game. A young girl, Leila, had &#x201c;called&#x201d; a boy named Finn to &#x201c;take the Longest Road&#x201d; for the third time that summer. No one, not even Jaelle, who had also been watching, knew exactly what that meant, though Jaelle was quick to enlist Leila as an acolyte in the Temple. The next day, riding outside the town walls, Jennifer met Brendel of the lios alfar&#x2014;the Children of Light&#x2014;and a party of his people. She spent the night in the woods with them, and in the darkness they were attacked. Concerned about the arrival of the five strangers, Rakoth Maugrim had Galadan and Metran&#x2014;the traitorous First Mage of Brennin&#x2014;abduct Jennifer. She was bound to the back of the black swan, Avaia, and borne north to Rakoth&#x2019;s fortress of Starkadh.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the terrifying explosion of the mountain had caused the death of the aged High King. This led to a tense confrontation between Diarmuid and his brother, Aileron&#x2014;who had been disguised as Ysanne&#x2019;s servant since his exile. The potentially violent situation was ended by Diarmuid&#x2019;s voluntarily relinquishing his claim to the throne, but not before he&#x2019;d received a knife in the shoulder, courtesy of Sharra of Cathal, who had come to Brennin to seek vengeance on him for the deception that had led to her seduction.</p> <p>In the meantime, Dave Martyniuk, the last of the five strangers, had been separated from the others in the crossing to Fionavar. He ended up far to the north among the Dalrei, the &#x201c;Riders,&#x201d; on the Plain, and found himself drawn into the life of the third tribe, led by Ivor, their Chieftain.</p> <p>Ivor&#x2019;s young son, Tabor, fasting in the forest for a vision of his totem animal, dreamt a seemingly impossible creature: a winged, chestnut unicorn. Three nights later, at the edge of the Great Wood, Pendaran, he met and flew upon this creature of his fast, Imraith-Nimphais&#x2014;a double-edged gift of the Goddess, born of the red full moon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Dave was escorted toward Brennin by a party of Dalrei led by Ivor&#x2019;s older son, Levon. The company was ambushed by a great number of the evil svart alfar, and only Dave, Levon, and a third Dalrei, Torc, survived by riding into the darkness of Pendaran Wood. The trees and spirits of Pendaran, hating all men since the loss of the beautiful Lisen of the Wood a thousand years before, plotted the death of the three men, but they were saved by the intervention of Flidais, a diminutive forest power, who claimed, among other things, to know the answers to all the riddles in all the worlds, save one: the name by which the &#x201c;Warrior&#x201d; could be summoned. As it happened, the search for this name was one of the tasks Ysanne had left with Kimberly.</p> <p>Flidais sent word to Ceinwen, the capricious, green-clad goddess of the Hunt, who had taken a special liking to Dave. The goddess arranged for the three friends to awaken safely on the southern edge of the Great Wood in the morning.</p> <p>She did more. She also caused Dave to find a long-lost object of power: Owein&#x2019;s Horn. Levon, who had been taught by wise old Gereint, the blind shaman of his tribe, then found the Cave of the Sleepers nearby&#x2014;a cave wherein Owein and the kings of the Wild Hunt lay asleep.</p> <p>The three friends rode south with this knowledge to Paras Derval, in time to arrive for the first council of Aileron&#x2019;s reign. The council was interrupted twice. The first time, by the arrival of Brock, a Dwarf from Banir Tal who knelt before Matt S�ren&#x2014;once King of the Dwarves&#x2014;and proffered the terrible tidings that the Dwarves, under the leadership of two brothers, Kaen and Bl�d, had helped the Unraveller to free himself by treacherously breaking the wardstone of Eridu, thus preventing any warning of Rakoth&#x2019;s stirring under the mountain. They had also found and delivered to Rakoth the Cauldron of Khath Meigol, which had the power to raise the newly dead.</p> <p>In the midst of this terrifying recitation, Kimberly suddenly saw&#x2014;in a vision shaped by the Baelrath&#x2014;Jennifer being raped and tortured by Rakoth in his fortress of Starkadh. She gathered Dave, Paul, and Kevin around her, reached out for Jennifer with the wild power of her ring, and drew the five of them out of Fionavar back to their own world.</p> <p>And so ended <i>The Summer Tree.</i></p> <p><i>The Wandering Fire</i> picked up the story some six months later, in November and back in Toronto, with Kimberly waiting for the dream that would give her the Warrior&#x2019;s summoning name. Jennifer, badly scarred in her soul and carrying the child of Rakoth Maugrim&#x2014;having vowed to give birth to that child as her answer to the Dark&#x2014;was brought early to her time by a sudden crossing back to Fionavar. The crossing was achieved by Paul when the two of them were threatened by Galadan, who had crossed to their world in pursuit of Paul.</p> <p>In Fionavar, Jennifer&#x2019;s child, Darien, was left to be secretly fostered in the house of Vae and Shahar, the parents of Finn&#x2014;the boy called by the children&#x2019;s counting game to &#x201c;take the Longest Road.&#x201d; The only persons informed of the secret were the priestesses of Dana, because Paul and Jennifer needed Jaelle&#x2019;s magic to send them home.</p> <p>The following spring Kim finally had the dream for which she had been waiting. As a result, the five traveled to Stonehenge where Kim raised the spirit of Uther Pendragon by the power of the Baelrath and compelled him to name his son&#x2019;s resting place. Kim then went alone, by the magic she carried, to Glastonbury Tor and there&#x2014;having first sent the others ahead to Fionavar&#x2014;she drew the Warrior, Arthur, from his rest by the summoning name: Childslayer. The name was an echo of the sin Arthur had committed in his youth after discovering his inadvertent incest with his sister. Kim and the Warrior followed the others to Paras Derval.</p> <p>An icy winter gripped Fionavar, even as midsummer approached&#x2014;a winter so terrible that Fordaetha, the Ice Queen of R�k, was able to come as far south as Paras Derval. She almost killed Paul in the Black Boar tavern before he succeeded in driving her back north. It was decided in council that Jaelle and the mages and Kimberly would join with Gereint, the old shaman, in an attempt to magically probe the source of the killing winter&#x2014;a necessary prelude to trying to end it.</p> <p>In the meantime the dimensions of Arthur Pendragon&#x2019;s tragedy were beginning to take shape as it became clear (to Brendel of the lios alfar, first of everyone) who Jennifer Lowell really was: Guinevere, beloved of Arthur and of Lancelot. Marred by her suffering in Starkadh, Jennifer withdrew to the sanctuary of Dana with Jaelle. It was Jaelle who explained that Vae and Finn had taken Darien (who was growing with the unnatural rapidity of all the andain&#x2014;children of mortals and gods) to Ysanne&#x2019;s cottage by the lake. There, Darien, seeming now to be a child of five years old, was growing up in the loving care of his foster mother and brother, who were troubled by two things: a power which caused his blue eyes to flash red, and an awareness that the child was drawn by voices in the storms of winter.</p> <p>On the Plain the Dalrei were hard-pressed. The winter had rendered the graceful eltor&#x2014;the creatures the Dalrei hunted and depended upon&#x2014;awkward and ungainly in the snow, which made them easy prey for Galadan&#x2019;s wolves. Ivor&#x2014;now Aven, or &#x201c;Father&#x201d; of all the Dalrei&#x2014;had herded the eltor down to the southeastern corner of the vast Plain, and there the gathered tribes guarded them as best they could. Until one attack included great numbers of the hideous urgach mounted upon six-legged monsters called slaug. Only the intervention of Diarmuid of Brennin, with Dave and Kevin in his company, saved the Dalrei from the first wave of the mounted urgach. And only the appearance of Ivor&#x2019;s son Tabor, riding Imraith-Nimphais, his deadly, winged mount with the shining horn, saved them from the second, larger wave. Ivor was painfully aware of the effect such flight had on Tabor, drawing him ever farther from the world of men.</p> <p>Shortly after, back in Brennin, another new strand entered the Tapestry. At the urging of Levon, Ivor&#x2019;s older son&#x2014;and having the reluctant agreement of Loren&#x2014;Kim and Dave, the bearers of what Levon thought to be the elements of an ancient verse that spoke of the waking of the Wild Hunt, went with a number of companions to the place at the edge of Pendaran Wood where the Cave of the Sleepers lay.

Her love of the infinite variety of English cooking and her knowledge of British culture and history show why our food should never be considered dull or limited. There are unusual dishes such as the Cornish Onion and Apple Pie, and even recipes for fungi, from common field mushrooms to puffballs. She describes some delicious puddings, cakes and breads, including an exotic violet flower ice cream, an eighteenth century coconut bread and Yorkshire teacakes. The finely-executed line drawings that accompany many of the recipes are more than just beautiful; they inform the cook about different varieties and techniques of food-handling. FOOD IN ENGLAND, which had such a deep influence on many contemporary cooks and food writers, will undoubtedly attract a new generation of admirers.</p><p>Dorothy Hartley wrote numerous books on British culture and history, including the six volumes of Life and Work of the People of England. FOOD IN ENGLAND is now regarded as a classic of its kind, with a deep influence on many contemporary cooks and food writers.&#39;A classic book without any worthy successor - a must for any keen English cook&#39; - DELIA SMITH &#39;Dorothy Hartley&#39;s ingenious ideas were one of my first inspirations; they show that English food should never be dismissed as boring&#39; - JOSCELINE DIMBLEBY &#39;This is the best of all books on English food. First published in 1954, it has popped up in print at intervals ever since, always welcome, always finding new admirers. Dorothy Hartley described Food In England as being like &#34;an old-fashioned kitchen, not impressive, but a warm and friendly place, where one can come in at any time and have a chat with the cook&#34;. So it is; and like a good old-fashioned kitchen it&#39;s intensely personal and full of bits and pieces at first sight not directly related to the production of food but somehow essential to the character of the place. Writing when she did, Dorothy Hartley was perhaps one of the last food historians to have easy access to the living past and her book views the preceding thousand years of food in England as a continuous present, all the cooks of the past wandering in and out of her kitchen. Full of traditional recipes, historical information, regional kitchen lore, personal reminiscences, household hints, gardening tips and brewing instructions, illuminating quotations and beautifully illustrated with expressive line drawings, Food In England is unsummarisable, copious and generous. Just buy it. Nobody with any interest whatsoever in English (and Scottish and Welsh) food, or who has any concern in what might make Britain British, should be without it.&#39; - Robin Davidson, AMAZON.CO.UK REVIEW</p><h2>Scarf Style 2: Innovative to Traditional, 26 Fresh Designs to Knit</h2><p>Discover fresh new designs for scarves, shawls, and cowls.

Lisette regrets having to give up her dream of becoming a gallery apprentice and longs for the comforts and sophistication of Paris. But as she soon discovers, the hilltop town is rich with unexpected pleasures.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pascal once worked in the nearby ochre mines and later became a pigment salesman and frame maker; while selling his pigments in Paris, he befriended Pissarro and C�zanne, some of whose paintings he received in trade for his frames. Pascal begins to tutor Lisette in both art and life, allowing her to see his small collection of paintings and the Proven�al landscape itself in a new light. Inspired by Pascal&#x2019;s advice to &#x201c;Do the important things first,&#x201d; Lisette begins a list of vows to herself (#<i>4. Learn what makes a painting great</i>). When war breaks out, Andr� goes off to the front, but not before hiding Pascal&#x2019;s paintings to keep them from the Nazis&#x2019; reach.<br> &nbsp;<br> With German forces spreading across Europe, the sudden fall of Paris, and the rise of Vichy France, Lisette sets out to locate the paintings (<i>#11. Find the paintings in my lifetime</i>). Her search takes her through the stunning French countryside, where she befriends Marc and Bella Chagall, who are in hiding before their flight to America, and acquaints her with the land, her neighbors, and even herself in ways she never dreamed possible. Through joy and tragedy, occupation and liberation, small acts of kindness and great acts of courage, Lisette learns to forgive the past, to live robustly, and to love again.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Lisette&#x2019;s List</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;Vreeland&#x2019;s love of painters and painting, her meticulous research and pitch-perfect descriptive talents . . . are abundantly evident in her new novel.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This historical novel&#x2019;s . . . great strength is its lovingly detailed setting. . . .

Meanwhile, I paced in a tight circle around our carpetbags, our valises, and our crates filled with everything we could take with us from our apartment in Paris, plus the tools from his workshop, plus the dream of my life sacrificed.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure we&#x2019;re in the right place?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Lisette.&#x201d; Andr� plucked a broad leaf off a nearby plane tree and laid it on a cobblestone. He touched my nose with his index finger and then pointed to the leaf. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll park right there. On that cobblestone. Just watch.&#x201d; He squeezed my hand. &#x201c;In the south of France, things happen as they should.&#x201d;<br><br>But apparently in the south of France, buses didn&#x2019;t operate on schedule, as they did in Paris. Nor did the light have the same effect as it did there. Here, the light singed the eye, wrapped itself around edges, intensified colors, ignited the spine. If it were otherwise, I would not have recognized the loveliness in a bare square that was not Paris, but there it was&#x2014;�a shimmering watercolor of fathers and grandfathers sitting under the plane tree, their white shirts blued by the cornflower sky, which found openings in the foliage, the men eating almonds from a paper bag, passing it from one end of the bench to the other and back again, perhaps talking of better days. They looked content, sitting there, while I withdrew my hand from Andr�&#x2019;s and made another senseless circuit around the modest pile of our belongings, feeling his gaze following me.<br><br>&#x201c;Look at them,&#x201d; Andr� said in a low voice. &#x201c;All members of the Honorary Order of Beret Wearers.&#x201d; He chuckled at his own invention.<br><br>Eventually a boxy little bus, a faded relic once painted orange beneath its rust, sputtered to a stop, the right front wheel crushing the leaf on the cobblestone. Andr� tipped his head and gave me an excusably smug but tender smile.<br><br>The stocky driver bounded down the steps, nimble-�footed, pointing his toes outward as weighty people do to keep their balance. He hailed Andr� by name, reached his thick arm up to slap him on the back, and said he was glad to see him.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s Pascal doing?&#x201d; Andr� asked.<br><br>&#x201c;He gets around all right most days. Louise takes him his meals or he eats with us.&#x201d;<br><br>The driver bowed to me with exaggerated courtliness.<br><br>&#x201c;Adieu, madame. I am Maurice, un chevalier de Provence. A knight of the roads. Not, however, Maurice Chevalier, who is a knight of the stage.&#x201d; He sent Andr� a wink. &#x201c;Your wife, she is more beautiful than Eleanor of Aquitaine.&#x201d;<br><br>Foolishness. I would not fall for it.<br><br>Had he said Adieu? &#x201c;Bonjour, monsieur,&#x201d; I responded properly.<br><br>I was amused by his attire&#x2014;�a red cravat above his undershirt, the only shirt he wore, which dipped in front to show his woolly chest; a red sash tied as a belt; his round head topped by a black beret. Black hair curled out from his armpits, a detail I could have done without noticing, but I am, thanks to Sister Marie Pierre, the noticing type.<br><br>He placed a hand over his fleshy bosom. &#x201c;I deliver ladies in distress. Enchant�, madame.&#x201d;<br><br>I gave Andr� a doleful look. I was in distress that very moment, already missing the life we had left behind.<br><br>&#x201c;Vite! Vite! Vite!&#x201d; The driver circled his arm around our bags in three quick movements, urging us to move quickly, quickly, quickly. &#x201c;We leave in two minutes.&#x201d; Then he was gone.<br><br>&#x201c;One vite was enough, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>With a wry twist of his mouth, Andr� said, &#x201c;People in Provence speak robustly. They live robustly too. Especially Maurice.&#x201d; Andr� began loading our bags and crates. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a good friend. I&#x2019;ve known him ever since I was a boy, when Pascal used to take me to visit Roussillon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the red sash for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a taillole. It signifies that he&#x2019;s a native son, a patriot of Provence.&#x201d;<br><br>We waited ten minutes. Two men took seats in the back of the bus. Soon I heard robust snoring.<br><br>Our self-�proclaimed chevalier finally scurried back. &#x201c;Sorry, sorry. I saw a friend,&#x201d; he said, working every feature of his round face, even his wide nostrils, into a smile of innocence, as though having seen a friend naturally justified the delay. He pumped up the tires with a hand pump&#x2014;�robustly, I observed&#x2014;�and started the engine, which choked in resistance, then lurched us ahead under the stone arch spanning the ramparts and out into the countryside to the east.<br><br>The road to Roussillon between two mountain ranges, the Monts de Vaucluse to the north and the Luberons to the south, kept me glued to the window. I had never been to the south of France.<br><br>&#x201c;Stop here!&#x201d; Andr� ordered. The bus came to a shuddering stop and Andr� hopped out, plucked a fistful of lavender growing wild along the roadside, climbed back in, and presented it to me. &#x201c;To welcome you to Provence. I&#x2019;m sorry it&#x2019;s not in its full purple bloom yet. In July you&#x2019;ll be astonished.&#x201d;<br><br>A sweet gesture, sweet as the fragrance itself.<br><br>&#x201c;How far is it to this Roussillon place?&#x201d; I asked the driver as we started down the road again.<br><br>&#x201c;Forty-�five beautiful kilometers, madame.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look. I think those are strawberry fields,&#x201d; Andr� said. &#x201c;You love strawberries.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And melons,&#x201d; Maurice added with a nasal twang. &#x201c;The best melons in France are grown right here in the valleys of the Vaucluse. And asparagus, lettuce, carrots, cabbages, celery, artichokes&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I get the idea.&#x201d;<br><br>He would not be yes-�yessed. &#x201c;Spinach, peas, beets. On higher ground, our famous fruit trees, vineyards, and olive groves.&#x201d;<br><br>He pronounced every syllable, even the normally mute e at the ends of some words, which made the language into something energetic, decorated, and bouncy instead of smoothly gliding, as it is in Paris.<br><br>&#x201c;Apricots. You love them too,&#x201d; Andr� said. &#x201c;You are entering the Garden of Eden.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see one snake and I&#x2019;m taking the next train back to Paris.&#x201d;<br><br>I had to admit that the fruit trees, laden with spring blossoms, exuded a heavenly fragrance. The grapevines were sprouting small chartreuse leaves, wild red poppies decorated the roadside, and the sun promised warmth, so welcome after a frigid winter in Paris.<br><br>But to live here for God knows how long&#x2014;�I had more than misgivings. For me to surrender the possibility of becoming an apprentice in the Galerie Laforgue, the chance of a lifetime for a woman of twenty with no formal education, had already caused resentment to surface in me. When Andr� had made what seemed an impulsive decision to leave Paris and live in a remote village just because his grandfather had appealed to him to keep him company in his failing health, I&#x2019;d been shocked. That he would so easily abandon his position as an officer of the Guild of Encadreurs, the association of picture-�frame craftsmen, a prestigious position for a man of twenty-�three, was inconceivable to me.<br><br>I had gone crying to Sister Marie Pierre at the Daughters of Saint-�Vincent-�de-�Paul, the orphanage where I had been raised, complaining that he was shortsighted and selfish, but she had given me little sympathy. &#x201c;Judge not, Lisette. See him in the best light, not the worst,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said. And so here I was, bumping along in clouds of dust, despairing that I wasn&#x2019;t in Paris, city of my birth, my happiness, my soul.<br><br>Following Sister Marie Pierre&#x2019;s advice to try to see the situation in the best light, I ventured a possibility. &#x201c;Tell me, monsieur. Does this town of yours have an art gallery?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A what?&#x201d; he screeched.<br><br>&#x201c;A place where original paintings are sold?&#x201d;<br><br>He howled a laugh from his belly. &#x201c;Non, madame. It is a village.&#x201d;<br><br>His laughter cut deeply. My yearning for art was nothing casual or recent. Even when I was a little girl, this longing had been a palpable force every time I stole into the chapel of the Daughters of Saint-�Vincent-�de-�Paul to look at the painting of the Madonna and Child. How a human being, not a god, could re-�create reality so accurately, how the deep blue of her cloak and the rich red of her dress could put me, a young orphan without a sou to my name, in touch with all that was fine and noble, how such beauty could stir something in me so deep that it must have been what Sister Marie Pierre called soul&#x2014;�such things drenched me with wonder.<br><br>Andr� jiggled my arm and pointed out a cluster of red geraniums spilling over the window box of a stone farmhouse. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. You&#x2019;re going to like it here, ma petite.&#x201d;<br><br>Because of geraniums?<br><br>&#x201c;Certainement, she will,&#x201d; Maurice chimed in from behind the wheel. &#x201c;Once she becomes accustomed to les quatre v�rit�s.&#x201d;<br><br>Four truths? &#x201c;And what might they be, monsieur?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You see three of them right here.&#x201d; He took his arm off the steering wheel to wave vaguely at the countryside, apparently able to drive and listen and talk and gesture all at once. Presumably that was a skill of living robustly. &#x201c;The mountains, the water, the sun.&#x201d;<br><br>True enough. The sunlight made the snow on the peak of a mountain to the north blindingly white. It shone on a river to the south in dancing specks of brilliance and turned the canals into iridescent silver-�green ribbons.<br><br>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s the fourth, monsieur?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be seen, and yet its mark is everywhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A riddle. You&#x2019;re telling me a riddle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, madame. I&#x2019;m telling you a truth. Andr�, he knows.&#x201d;<br><br>I turned to Andr�, who tipped his head toward the window and said, &#x201c;Think and look. Look and think.&#x201d;<br><br>I studied the landscape for some mark.<br><br>&#x201c;Does it have to do with those stone walls?&#x201d; They were actually only remnants of walls, piles of flat stones forming barriers nearly a meter thick, some with wayside niches for figures of saints, I presumed, although I hadn&#x2019;t seen any.<br><br>&#x201c;No, madame. Those were built in the Middle Ages to keep out the plague.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a comforting thought, monsieur. Neither is that scraping noise. Is there something wrong with your brakes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, madame. You are hearing the sound of cigales. Insects that make their mating calls when the temperature gets warm.&#x201d;<br><br>Definitely something I would have to get used to. Thickly planted cypress trees lined the north sides of the vegetable fields. Their pointed shadows stretched toward us like witches&#x2019; gray fingers.<br><br>Looking from side to side, I noticed another peculiarity. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t the houses on the right side have windows facing the road, while the ones on the left side do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re thinking. Look. They all have windows on three sides, but not on the north.&#x201d;<br><br>But why? Did the sun glare through north windows too strongly? No. It would shine from the south, giving light to only half of the house. The other half would be dark and gloomy.<br><br>When I asked Andr� for a hint, he told me to look at the roofs. They were terra-�cotta tiles, long, tubular, and overlapping. Flat stones had been placed at their northern edges.</p><h2>The Present: The Gift That Makes You Happy and Successful at Work and in Life</h2><p>An extended retelling of the original classic parable by the author of Who Moved My Cheese? follows a young man&#39;s search for an elusive gift that holds the promise of work fulfillment, a quest that is complicated by his fears about the future. 200,000 first printing.</p><p>"Like many organisations, we need ways to help our people work better and enjoy their lives, so I'm giving <i>The Present</i> to everyone on our management team" (Carmen Policy, CEO, Cleveland Browns NFL Team)<br><br>"Many of the people I have observed could have been even happier and more successful, in their careers and their lives, had they been given the gift of <i>The Present</i>" (Norman Augustine, Fmr.Chairman, USA Red Cross)The long-awaited follow-up to the groundbreaking world bestseller WHO MOVED MY CHEESE? &#x2013; a parable with an invaluable lesson for all of us who live and work in today&#x2019;s turbulent times</p><h2>Truck Stop</h2><p>Early each morning,<br>before the sun is even up,<br>the Truck Stop opens for breakfast,<br>and the trucks start pulling in.<br>Eighteen wheeler,<br>milk tank,<br>moving van,<br>and flatbed!<br>Their drivers order eggs and bacon,<br>pancakes with syrup,<br>and a blueberry muffin.<br>For the boy who helps his parents at the counter, there is nothing better than seeing all the trucks roll in; he knows every single one . . . and can tell when one is missing!<br><br>Here is a story for very young truck lovers, worth stopping for again and again.</p><p>Anne Rockwell (www.annerockwell.com) began writing and illustrating children's books in the 1950s and is well known and loved by generations of children.

He and his parents get up early and prepare for customers who have breakfast at the diner. Uncle Marty turns on the lights in the garage. All the regulars start arriving, including Maisie, who drives a milk tank, and Dan, who drives a moving van. Everyone has a "usual" order, like sausage and pancakes with lots of syrup. But the man who drives a green pickup is missing, and no one has seen him. Soon the Big Yellow Bus comes by and, on the way to school, the narrator spots Green Gus by the side of the road. The boy asks the bus driver to call the truck stop, and he knows that Pete and Priscilla's Tow Truck will come by, that Uncle Marty will fix the problem, and that the driver will have bacon and eggs sunny side up.

She is the author of five novels and seven previous books of nonfiction.Girl of the Golden West<br><br>The domestic details spring to memory. Early on the evening of February 4, 1974, in her duplex apartment at 2603 Benvenue in Berkeley, Patricia Campbell Hearst, age nineteen, a student of art history at the University of California at Berkeley and a granddaughter of the late William Randolph Hearst, put on a blue terry-cloth bathrobe, heated a can of chicken-noodle soup and made tuna fish sandwiches for herself and her fianc�, Steven Weed; watched <i>Mission Impossible</i> and <i>The Magician</i> on television; cleaned up the dishes; sat down to study just as the doorbell rang; was abducted at gunpoint and held blindfolded, by three men and five women who called themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army, for the next fifty-seven days.<br><br>From the fifty-eighth day, on which she agreed to join her captors and was photographed in front of the SLA's cobra flag carrying a sawed-off M-1 carbine, until September 18, 1975, when she was arrested in San Francisco, Patricia Campbell Hearst participated actively in the robberies of the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco and the Crocker National Bank outside Sacramento; sprayed Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles with a submachine gun to cover a comrade apprehended for shoplifting; and was party or witness to a number of less publicized thefts and several bombings, to which she would later refer as "actions," or "operations."<br><br>On trial in San Francisco for the Hibernia Bank operation she appeared in court wearing frosted-white nail polish, and demonstrated for the jury the bolt action necessary to chamber an M-1. On a psychiatric test administered while she was in custody she completed the sentence "Most men . . ." with the words ". . . are assholes." Seven years later she was living with the bodyguard she had married, their infant daughter, and two German shepherds "behind locked doors in a Spanish-style house equipped with the best electronic security system available," describing herself as "older and wiser," and dedicating her account of these events, <i>Every Secret Thing</i>, to "Mom and Dad."<br>It was a special kind of sentimental education, a public coming-of-age with an insistently literary cast to it, and it seemed at the time to offer a parable for the period. Certain of its images entered the national memory. We had Patricia Campbell Hearst in her first-communion dress, smiling, and we had Patricia Campbell Hearst in the Hibernia Bank surveillance stills, not smiling. We again had her smiling in the engagement picture, an unremarkably pretty girl in a simple dress on a sunny lawn, and we again had her not smiling in the "Tania" snapshot, the famous Polaroid with the M-1. We had her with her father and her sister Anne in a photograph taken at the Burlingame Country Club some months before the kidnapping: all three Hearsts smiling there, not only smiling but wearing leis, the father in maile and orchid leis, the daughters in pikake, that rarest and most expensive kind of lei, strand after strand of tiny Arabian jasmine buds strung like ivory beads.<br><br>We had the bank of microphones in front of the Hillsborough house whenever Randolph and Catherine Hearst ("Dad" and "Mom" in the first spectral messages from the absent daughter, "pig Hearsts" as the spring progressed) met the press, the potted flowers on the steps changing with the seasons, domestic upkeep intact in the face of crisis: azaleas, fuchsias, then cymbidium orchids massed for Easter. We had, early on, the ugly images of looting and smashed cameras and frozen turkey legs hurled through windows in West Oakland, the violent result of the Hearsts' first attempt to meet the SLA ransom demand, and we had, on television the same night, the news that William Knowland, the former United States senator from California and the most prominent member of the family that had run Oakland for half a century, had taken the pistol he was said to carry as protection against terrorists, positioned himself on a bank of the Russian River, and blown off the top of his head.<br><br>All of these pictures told a story, taught a dramatic lesson, carrying as they did the <i>frisson</i> of one another, the invitation to compare and contrast. The image of Patricia Campbell Hearst on the FBI "wanted" fliers was for example cropped from the image of the unremarkably pretty girl in the simple dress on the sunny lawn, schematic evidence that even a golden girl could be pinned in the beam of history. There was no actual connection between turkey legs thrown through windows in West Oakland and William Knowland lying facedown in the Russian River, but the paradigm was manifest, one California busy being born and another busy dying. Those cymbidiums on the Hearsts' doorstep in Hillsborough dissolved before our eyes into the image of a flaming palm tree in south-central Los Angeles (the model again was two Californias), the palm tree above the stucco bungalow in which Patricia Campbell Hearst was believed for a time to be burning to death on live television. (Actually, Patricia Campbell Hearst was in yet a third California, a motel room at Disneyland, watching the palm tree burn as we all were, on television, and it was Donald DeFreeze, Nancy Ling Perry, Angela Atwood, Patricia Soltysik, Camilla Hall, and William Wolfe, one black escaped convict and five children of the white middle class, who were dying in the stucco bungalow.)<br><br>Not only the images but the voice told a story, the voice on the tapes, the depressed voice with the California inflection, the voice that trailed off, now almost inaudible, then a hint of whine, a schoolgirl's sarcasm, a voice every parent recognized: <i>Mom, Dad. I'm OK. I had a few scrapes and stuff, but they washed them up. . . . I just hope you'll do what they say, Dad. . . . If you can get the food thing organized before the nineteenth then that's OK. . . . Whatever you come up with is basically OK, it was never intended that you feed the whole state. . . . I am here because I am a member of a ruling-class family and I think you can begin to see the analogy. . . . People should stop acting like I'm dead, Mom should get out of her black dress, that doesn't help at all. . . . Mom, Dad . . . I don't believe you're doing all you can . . . Mom, Dad . . . I'm starting to think that no one is concerned about me anymore. . . . </i>And then: <i>Greetings to the people. This is Tania.</i><br>Patricia Campbell Hearst's great-grandfather had arrived in California by foot in 1850, unschooled, unmarried, thirty years old with few graces and no prospects, a Missouri farmer's son who would spend his thirties scratching around El Dorado and Nevada and Sacramento counties looking for a stake. In 1859 he found one, and at his death in 1891 George Hearst could leave the schoolteacher he had married in 1862 a fortune taken from the ground, the continuing proceeds from the most productive mines of the period, the Ophir in Nevada, the Homestake in South Dakota, the Ontario in Utah, the Anaconda in Montana, the San Luis in Mexico. The widow, Phoebe Apperson Hearst, a tiny, strong-minded woman then only forty-eight years old, took this apparently artesian income and financed her only child in the publishing empire he wanted, underwrote a surprising amount of the campus where her great-granddaughter would be enrolled at the time she was kidnapped, and built for herself, on sixty-seven thousand acres on the McCloud River in Siskiyou County, the original Wyntoon, a quarried-lava castle of which its architect, Bernard Maybeck, said simply: "Here you can reach all that is within you."<br><br>The extent to which certain places dominate the California imagination is apprehended, even by Californians, only dimly. Deriving not only from the landscape but from the claiming of it, from the romance of emigration, the radical abandonment of established attachments, this imagination remains obdurately symbolic, tending to locate lessons in what the rest of the country perceives only as scenery. Yosemite, for example, remains what Kevin Starr has called "one of the primary California symbols, a fixed factor of identity for all those who sought a primarily Californian aesthetic." Both the community of and the coastline at Carmel have a symbolic meaning lost to the contemporary visitor, a lingering allusion to art as freedom, freedom as craft, the "bohemian" pantheism of the early twentieth century. The Golden Gate Bridge, referring as it does to both the infinite and technology, suggests, to the Californian, a quite complex representation of land's end, and also of its beginning.<br><br>Patricia Campbell Hearst told us in <i>Every Secret Thing</i> that the place the Hearsts called Wyntoon was "a mystical land," "fantastic, otherworldly," "even more than San Simeon," which was in turn "so emotionally moving that it is still beyond my powers of description." That first Maybeck castle on the McCloud River was seen by most Californians only in photographs, and yet, before it burned in 1933, to be replaced by a compound of rather more playful Julia Morgan chalets ("Cinderella House," "Angel House," "Brown Bear House"), Phoebe Hearst's gothic Wyntoon and her son's baroque San Simeon seemed between them to embody certain opposing impulses in the local consciousness: northern and southern, wilderness sanctified and wilderness banished, the aggrandizement of nature and the aggrandizement of self. Wyntoon had mists, and allusions to the infinite, great trunks of trees left to rot where they fell, a wild river, barbaric fireplaces. San Simeon, swimming in sunlight and the here and now, had two swimming pools, and a zoo.<br>It was a family in which the romantic impulse would seem to have dimmed. Patricia Campbell Hearst told us that she "grew up in an atmosphere of clear blue skies, bright sunshine, rambling open spaces, long green lawns, large comfortable houses, country clubs with swimming...</p><h2>The Best of J.

History has accused wartime pontiff Pius the Twelfth of complicity in the Holocaust and dubbed him "Hitler's Pope." But a key part of the story has remained untold.<br><br>Pius ran the world's largest church, smallest state, and oldest spy service. Saintly but secretive, he skimmed from church charities to pay covert couriers, and surreptitiously tape-recorded his meetings with top Nazis. When he learned of the Holocaust, Pius played his cards close to his chest. He sent birthday cards to Hitler--while plotting to overthrow him.<br><br><i>Church of Spies</i> documents this cross-and-dagger intrigue in shocking detail. Gun-toting Jesuits stole blueprints to Hitler's homes. A Catholic book publisher flew a sports plane over the Alps with secrets filched from the head of Hitler's bodyguard. The keeper of the Vatican crypt ran a spy ring that betrayed German war plans and wounded Hitler in a briefcase bombing.<br><br>The plotters made history in ways they hardly expected. They inspired European unification, forged a U.S.-Vatican alliance that spanned the Cold War, and challenged Church teachings on Jews. Yet Pius' secret war muted his public response to Nazi crimes. Fearing that overt protest would impede his covert actions, he never spoke the "fiery words" he wanted.<br><br>Told with heart-pounding suspense, based on secret transcripts and unsealed files, <i>Church of Spies</i> throws open the Vatican's doors to reveal some of the most astonishing events in the history of the papacy.&nbsp;<br>"[E]xciting.... deals fairly with the pope's theological and political rationale.... thoroughly documented with primary sources... <i>Church of Spies</i> is the best account of the subject to date.

THE SECRET AGENT</b></p> <p>The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning. Then the soul-erosion produced by high gambling&#x2014;a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension&#x2014;becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it.</p> <p>James Bond suddenly knew that he was tired. He always knew when his body or his mind had had enough and he always acted on the knowledge. This helped him to avoid staleness and the sensual bluntness that breeds mistakes.</p> <p>He shifted himself unobtrusively away from the roulette he had been playing and went to stand for a moment at the brass rail which surrounded breast-high the top table in the salle privee.</p> <p>Le Chiffre was still playing and still, apparently, winning. There was an untidy pile of flecked hundred-mille plaques in front of him. In the shadow of his thick left arm there nestled a discreet stack of the big yellow ones worth half a million francs each.</p> <p>Bond watched the curious, impressive profile for a time, and then he shrugged his shoulders to lighten his thoughts and moved away.</p> <p>The barrier surrounding the caisse comes as high as your chin and the caissier, who is generally nothing more than a minor bank clerk, sits on a stool and dips into his piles of notes and plaques. These are ranged on shelves. They are on a level, behind the protecting barrier, with your groin. The caissier has a cosh and a gun to protect him, and to heave over the barrier and steal some notes and then vault back and get out of the casino through the passages and doors would be impossible. And the caissiers generally work in pairs.</p> <p>Bond reflected on the problem as he collected the sheaf of hundred thousand and then the sheaves often thousand franc notes. With another part of his mind, he had a vision of tomorrow's regular morning meeting of the casino committee.</p> <p>'Monsieur Le Chiffre made two million. He played his usual game. Miss Fairchild made a million in an hour and then left. She executed three "bancos" of Monsieur Le Chiffre within an hour and then left. She played with coolness. Monsieur le Vicomte de Villorin made one million two at roulette. He was playing the maximum on the first and last dozens. He was lucky. Then the Englishman, Mister Bond, increased his winnings to exactly three million over the two days. He was playing a progressive system on red at table five. Duclos, the chef de partie, has the details. It seems that he is persevering and plays in maximums. He has luck. His nerves seem good. On the soiree, the chemin-de-fer won x, the baccarat won y and the roulette won z. The boule, which was again badly frequented, still makes its expenses.'</p> <p>'Merci, Monsieur Xavier.'</p> <p>'Merci, Monsieur le President.'</p> <p>Or something like that, thought Bond as he pushed his way through the swing doors of the salle privee and nodded to the bored man in evening clothes whose job it is to bar your entry and your exit with the electric foot-switch which can lock the doors at any hint of trouble.</p> <p>And the casino committee would balance its books and break up to its homes or cafes for lunch.</p> <p>As for robbing the caisse, in which Bond himself was not personally concerned, but only interested, he reflected that it would take ten good men, that they would certainly have to kill one or two employees, and that anyway you probably couldn't find ten non-squeal killers in France, or in any other country for the matter of that.</p> <p>As he gave a thousand francs to the vestiaire and walked down the steps of the casino. Bond made up his mind that Le Chiffre would in no circumstances try to rob the caisse and he put the contingency out of his mind. Instead he explored his present physical sensations. He felt the dry, uncomfortable gravel under his evening shoes, the bad, harsh taste in his mouth and the slight sweat under his arms. He could feel his eyes filling their sockets. The front of his face, his nose and antrum, were congested. He breathed the sweet night air deeply and focused his senses and his wits. He wanted to know if anyone had searched his room since he had left it before dinner.</p> <p>He walked across the broad boulevard and through the gardens to the Hotel Splendide. He smiled at the concierge who gave him his key&#x2014;No 45 on the first floor&#x2014;and took the cable.</p> <p>It was from Jamaica and read:</p> <p>KINGSTONJA XXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXX<br> BOND SPLENDIDE ROYALE-LES-EAUX SEINE<br> INFERIEURE HAVANA CIGAR PRODUCTION ALL<br> CUBAN FACTORIES 1915 TEN MILLION REPEAT<br> TEN MILLION STOP HOPE THIS FIGURE YOU<br> REQUIRE REGARDS.<br> </p> <p>DASILVA<br> </p> <p>This meant that ten million francs was on the way to him. It was the reply to a request Bond had sent that afternoon through Paris to his headquarters in London asking for more funds. Paris had spoken to London where Clements, the head of Bond's department, had spoken to M, who had smiled wryly and told 'The Broker' to fix it with the Treasury.</p> <p>Bond had once worked in Jamaica and his cover on the Royale assignment was that of a very rich client of Messrs Caffery, the principal import and export firm of Jamaica. So he was being controlled through Jamaica, through a taciturn man who was head of the picture desk on the Daily Gleaner, the famous newspaper of the Caribbean.</p> <p>This man on the Gleaner, whose name was Fawcett, had been bookkeeper for one of the leading turtle fisheries on the Cayman Islands. One of the men from the Caymans who had volunteered on the outbreak of war, he had ended up as a Paymaster's clerk in a small Naval Intelligence organization in Malta. At the end of the war, when, with a heavy heart, he was due to return to the Caymans, he was spotted by the section of the Secret Service concerned with the Caribbean. He was strenuously trained in photography and in some other arts and, with the quiet connivance of an influential man in Jamaica, found his way to the picture desk of the Gleaner.</p> <p>In the intervals between sifting photographs submitted by the great agencies&#x2014;Keystone, Wide-World, Universal, INP, and Reuter-Photo&#x2014;he would get peremptory instructions by telephone from a man he had never met to carry out certain simple operations 1 requiring nothing but absolute discretion, speed, and accuracy. For these occasional services he received twenty pounds a month paid into his account with the Royal Bank of Canada by a fictitious relative in England.</p> <p>Fawcett's present assignment was to relay immediately to Bond, full rates, the text of messages which he received at home by telephone from his anonymous contact. He had been told by this contact that nothing he would be asked to send would arouse the suspicion of the Jamaican post office. So he was not surprised to find himself suddenly appointed string correspondent for the 'Maritime Press and Photo Agency', with press-collect facilities to France and England, on a further monthly retainer of ten pounds.</p> <p>He felt secure and encouraged, had visions of a BEM and made the first payment on a Morris Minor. He also bought a green eye-shade which he had long coveted and which helped him to impose his personality on the picture desk.</p> <p>Some of this background to his cable passed through Bond's mind. He was used to oblique control and rather liked it. He felt it feather-bedded him a little, allowed him to give or take an hour or two in his communications with M. He knew that this was probably a fallacy, that probably there was another member of the Service at Royale-les-Eaux who was reporting independently, but it did give the illusion that he wasn't only 150 miles across the Channel from that deadly office building near Regent's Park, being watched and judged by those few cold brains that made the whole show work. Just as Fawcett, the Cayman Islander in Kingston, knew that if he bought that Morris Minor outright instead of signing the hire-purchase agreement, someone in London would probably know and want to know where the money had come from.</p> <p>Bond read the cable twice. He tore a telegram form off the pad on the desk (why give them carbon copies?) and wrote his reply in capital letters:</p> <p>THANKS INFORMATION SHOULD SUFFICE&#x2014;BOND</p> <p>He handed this to the concierge and put the cable signed 'Dasilva' in his pocket. The employers (if any) of the concierge could bribe a copy out of the local post office, if the concierge hadn't already steamed the envelope open or read the cable upside down in Bond's hands.</p> <p>He took his key and said good night and turned to the stairs, shaking his head at the liftman. Bond knew what an obliging danger-signal a lift could be. He didn't expect anyone to be moving on the first floor, but he preferred to be prudent.</p> <p>Walking quietly up on the balls of his feet, he regretted the hubris of his reply to M via Jamaica. As a gambler he knew it was a mistake to rely on too small a capital. Anyway, M probably wouldn't let him have any more. He shrugged his shoulders and turned off the stairs into the corridor and walked softly to the door of his room.</p> <p>Bond knew exactly where the switch was and it was with one flow of motion that he stood on the threshold with the door full open, the light on and a gun in his hand. The safe, empty room sneered at him. He ignored the half-open door of the bathroom and, locking himself in, he turned up the bed-light and the mirror-light and threw his gun on the settee beside the window. Then he bent down and inspected one of his own black hairs which still lay undisturbed where he had left it before dinner, wedged into the drawer of the writing-desk.</p> <p>Next he examined a faint trace of talcum powder on the inner rim of the porcelain handle of the clothes cupboard. It appeared immaculate. He went into the bathroom, lifted the cover of the lavatory cistern and verified the level of the water against a small scratch on the copper ball-cock.</p> <p>Doing all this, inspecting these minute burglar alarms, did not make him feel foolish or self-conscious. He was a secret agent, an...</p></p><h2>Second Foundation (Foundation Novels)</h2><p>So far the Foundation was safe. But there was a hidden Second Foundation to protect the first. The Mule has yet to find it, but he was getting closer all the time. The men of the Foundation sought it, too, to escape from Mule&#39;s mind control.

As unsurpassed blend of nonstop action, daring ideas, and extensive world-building, they chronicle the struggle of a courageous group of men and women dedicated to preserving humanity's light in a galaxy plunged into a nightmare of ignorance and violence thirty thousand years long. <br>After years of struggle, the Foundation lies in ruins--destroyed by the mutant mind power of the Mule. But it is rumored that there is a Second Foundation hidden somewhere at the end of the Galaxy, established to preserve the knowledge of mankind through the long centuries of barbarism. The Mule failed to find it the first time--but now he is certain he knows where it lies. <br>The fate of the Foundation rests on young Arcadia Darell, only fourteen years old and burdened with a terrible secret. As its scientists gird for a final showdown with the Mule, the survivors of the First Foundation begin their desperate search. They too want the Second Foundation destroyed...before it destroys them.Isaac Asimov, world maestro of science fiction, was born in Russia near Smolensk in 1920 and was brought to the United States by his parents three years later. He grew up in Brooklyn where he went to grammar school and at the age of eight he gained his citizen papers. A remarkable memory helped him finish high school before he was sixteen. He then went on to Columbia University and resolved to become a chemist rather than follow the medical career his father had in mind for him. He graduated in chemistry and after a short spell in the Army he gained his doctorate in 1949 and qualified as an instructor in biochemistry at Boston University School of Medicine where he became Associate Professor in 1955, doing research in nucleic acid. Increasingly, however, the pressures of chemical research conflicted with his aspirations in the literary field, and in 1958 he retired to full-time authorship while retaining his connection with the University. Asimov&#39;s fantastic career as a science fiction writer began in 1939 with the appearance of a short story, `Marooned Off Vesta&#39;, in Amazing Stories. Thereafter he became a regular contributor to the leading SF magazines of the day including Astounding, Astonishing Stories, Super Science Stories and Galaxy. He won the Hugo Award four times and the Nebula Award once. With nearly five hundred books to his credit and several hundred articles, Asimov&#39;s output was prolific by any standards. Apart from his many world-famous science fiction works, Asimov also wrote highly successful detective mystery stories, a four-volume History of North America, a two-volume Guide to the Bible, a biographical dictionary, encyclopaedias, textbooks and an impressive list of books on many aspects of science, as well as two volumes of autobiography. Isaac Asimov died in 1992 at the age of 72.</p><h2>National Geographic Concise History of the World: An Illustrated Time Line</h2><p>From the dawn of humankind to today's global complexities, this monumental volume presents world history from an original perspective that provides fresh insights with every colorful spread. Few references are as invaluable, all-inclusive, and satisfying to browse. For readers of all ages, world history is easily accessible, depicted as never before&#x2014;so that events occurring simultaneously around the world can be viewed at-a-glance together. For example, Texas Instruments launched the pocket calculator the same year the Soviet Union launched the first manned space station, in 1971. Columbus sailed from Spain the year Martin Behaim constructed a terrestrial globe in Nuremberg. The California Gold Rush followed the Irish Potato Famine in the 1840s, and the Greek dictatorship of Papadopoulos is overthrown the same year Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia is deposed and U.S. president Nixon resigns, in 1974. The book's innovative time line truly sets it apart, allowing readers to scan across a spread and explore a single area or compare contemporary societies across the globe. <br><br>This remarkable resource also contains dozens of maps; scores of sidebars; hundreds of illustrations; and thousands of events, milestones, personalities, ideas, and inventions. Throughout, vivid illustrations depict artworks, artifacts, portraits and dramatic scenes, while sidebar topics range from local customs and lifestyles to the effect of climate change on human migration.

National ad/promo.</p><p>In its heyday during the height of segregation, the little resort of American Beach, Florida was the African American Hyannisport, where the cr�me de la cr�me of black society came to enjoy what the town motto called "recreation and relaxation without humiliation." These days, it's more like the African American Daytona Beach--that is, visited mostly by partying teenagers who come to drink and get rowdy in the town's deserted streets. What happened between then and now could be fodder for a sociologist's study, but journalist Russ Rymer turns it instead into a grippingly personal story of race, money, greed, and the struggle over who owns--and interprets--cultural memory.<p> At the heart of Rymer's tale is one of the most fascinating characters to walk the pages of a book this year: MaVynee Betsch, great-granddaughter of Abraham Lincoln Lewis, an African American millionaire and the founder of American Beach. Reared in privilege and culture, sixtyish MaVynee once sang lieder throughout the capitals of Europe. Now she lives the gypsy life in the open air of American Beach, an unforgettable sight in her 18-inch fingernails, cowrie anklets, and five-foot fall of hair. Having given all her money away, MaVynee spends her time evoking the glories of her community's past and railing against the white-bread resorts, whose golf courses and cookie-cutter condos threaten to swallow her beloved beach. The painful irony is that when the enforced humiliation of segregation ended, so too did the cohesiveness of the black commercial and professional community American Beach once represented. As one resident puts it, "First we had segregation, and then integration. Then disintegration."</p><p> Rymer's story ripples outward to encompass bygone black Jacksonville, the killing of an unarmed African American by Amelia Island police, the first incorporated black town in the United States, A.L. Lewis's Afro-American Life Insurance Company, and revered Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston. But it never loses focus on its fundamental question, a question with equal relevance for both black and white: "Where did mankind's economic existence and moral existence coincide, and where collide, and where was the boundary between them?" Rymer avoids both ideology and easy answers in this passionate yet even-handed book. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Russ Rymer's articles have appeared in <i>The New Yorker, Harper's, Health, Vogue, The Sciences, </i> the <i>Washington Post,</i> the <i>New York Times</i>, and other publications.

Trickster deities thrive on contrariety, which is why one finds them bringing life into dead landscapes and disorder into order. A Santa Barbara insurance salesman&#39;s too-tidily-contained lifestyle, far from the Crow reservation he grew up on, is an irresistible target for Coyote, who wants to make sure his chosen people don&#39;t forget him. Coyote descends on Sam Hunter like one of Job&#39;s plagues, albeit a charmingly disingenuous one. &#34;Why me? Why not someone who believes?&#34; asks Sam, suffering from god-induced chaos. &#34;This is more fun,&#34; says Coyote.

England is at war, and Matthew Shardlake is about to encounter the most politically dangerous case of his career. While a massive French fleet prepares to attack, every able-bodied man is being pressed into military service. Meanwhile, an old servant of Queen Catherine Parr asks Shardlake to investigate claims of "monstrous wrongs" committed against a young ward of the court. Shardlake's inquiries take him and his loyal assistant, Jack Barak, to Hoyland Priory and Portsmouth, where the English fleet is gathering. There they uncover a startling link between the ward and a woman incarcerated in Bedlam. With a fantastic backdrop of wartime intrigue and a dramatic finale onboard one of Henry VIII's great warships, <i>Heartstone</i> is certain to catapult this internationally bestselling series to greater prominence.</p><p><b>C. J. Sansom</b>, the internationally bestselling author of&nbsp;the novels&nbsp;<i>Winter in Madrid</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Dominion</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Matthew Shardlake Tudor Mystery series,&nbsp;earned a Ph.D. in history and was a lawyer before becoming a full-time writer.<i><b>Chapter One<br></b></i><br><br>The churchyard was peaceful in the summer afternoon. Twigs and branches lay strewn across the gravel path, torn from the trees by the gales which had swept the country in that stormy June of 1545. In London we had escaped lightly, only a few chimneypots gone, but the winds had wreaked havoc in the north. People spoke of hailstones there as large as fists, with the shapes of faces on them. But tales become more dramatic as they spread, as any lawyer knows.<br>&nbsp;<br>I had been in my chambers in Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn all morning, working through some new briefs for cases in the Court of Requests. They would not be heard until the autumn now; the Trinity law term had ended early by order of the King, in view of the threat of invasion.<br>&nbsp;<br>In recent months I had found myself becoming restless with my paperwork. With a few exceptions the same cases came up again and again in Requests: landlords wanting to turn tenant farmers off their lands to pasture sheep for the profitable wool trade, or for the same reason trying to appropriate the village commons on which the poor depended. Worthy cases, but always the same. And as I worked, my eyes kept drifting to the letter delivered by a messenger from Hampton Court. It lay on the corner of my desk, a white rectangle with a lump of red sealing wax glinting in the centre. The letter worried me, all the more for its lack of detail. Eventually, unable to keep my thoughts from wandering, I decided to go for a walk.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I left chambers I saw a flower seller, a young woman, had got past the Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn gatekeeper. She stood in a corner of Gatehouse Court, in a grey dress with a dirty apron, her face framed by a white coif, holding out posies to the passing barristers. As I went by she called out that she was a widow, her husband dead in the war. I saw she had wallflowers in her basket; they reminded me I had not visited my poor housekeeper&#x2019;s grave for nearly a month, for wallflowers had been Joan&#x2019;s favourite. I asked for a bunch, and she held them out to me with a work-roughened hand. I passed her a halfpenny; she curtsied and thanked me graciously, though her eyes were cold. I walked on, under the Great Gate and up newly paved Chancery Lane to the little church at the top.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I walked I chided myself for my discontent, reminding myself that many of my colleagues envied my position as counsel at the Court of Requests, and that I also had the occasional lucrative case put my way by the Queen&#x2019;s solicitor. But, as the many thoughtful and worried faces I passed in the street reminded me, the times were enough to make any man&#x2019;s mind unquiet. They said the French had gathered thirty thousand men in their Channel ports, ready to invade England in a great fleet of warships, some even with stables on board for horses. No one knew where they might land, and throughout the country men were being mustered and sent to defend the coasts. Every vessel in the King&#x2019;s fleet had put to sea, and large merchant ships were being impounded and made ready for war. The King had levied unprecedented taxes to pay for his invasion of France the previous year. It had been a complete failure and since last winter an English army had been besieged in Boulogne. And now the war might be coming to us.<br>&nbsp;<br>I passed into the churchyard. However much one lacks piety, the atmosphere in a graveyard encourages quiet reflection. I knelt and laid the flowers on Joan&#x2019;s grave. She had run my little household near twenty years; when she first came to me she had been a widow of forty and I a callow, recently qualified barrister. A widow with no family, she had devoted her life to looking after my needs; quiet, efficient, kindly. She had caught influenza in the spring and been dead in a week. I missed her deeply, all the more because I realized how all these years I had taken her devoted care for granted. The contrast with the wretch I now had for a steward was bitter.<br>&nbsp;<br>I stood up with a sigh, my knees cracking. Visiting the grave had quieted me, but stirred those melancholy humours to which I was naturally prey. I walked on among the headstones, for there were others I had known who lay buried here. I paused before a fine marble stone:<br>&nbsp;<br>Roger Elliard<br>Barrister of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn<br>Beloved husband and father<br>1502&#x2013;1543<br>&nbsp;<br>I remembered a conversation Roger and I had had, shortly before his death two years before, and smiled sadly. We had talked of how the King had wasted the riches he had gained from the monasteries, spending them on palaces and display, doing nothing to replace the limited help the monks had given the poor. I laid a hand on the stone and said quietly, &#x2018;Ah, Roger, if you could see what he has brought us to now.&#x2019; An old woman arranging flowers on a grave nearby looked round at me, an anxious frown on her wrinkled face at the sight of a hunchbacked lawyer talking to the dead. I moved away.<br>&nbsp;<br>A little way off stood another headstone, one which, like Joan&#x2019;s, I had had set in that place, with but a short inscription;<br>&nbsp;<br>Giles Wrenne<br>Barrister of York<br>1467&#x2013;1541<br>&nbsp;<br>That headstone I did not touch, nor did I address the old man who lay beneath, but I remembered how Giles had died and realized that indeed I was inviting a black mood to descend on me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then a sudden blaring noise startled me almost out of my wits. The old woman stood and stared around her, wide-eyed. I guessed what must be happening. I walked over to the wall separating the churchyard from Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields and opened the wooden gate. I stepped through, and looked at the scene beyond.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields was an empty, open space of heathland, where law students hunted rabbits on the grassy hill of Coney Garth. Normally on a Tuesday afternoon there would have been only a few people passing to and fro. Today, though, a crowd was gathered, watching as fifty young men, many in shirts and jerkins but some in the blue robes of apprentices, stood in five untidy rows. Some looked sulky, some apprehensive, some eager. Most carried the warbows that men of military age were required to own by law for the practice of archery, though many disobeyed the rule, preferring the bowling greens or the dice and cards that were illegal now for those without gentleman status. The warbows were two yards long, taller than their owners for the most part. Some men, though, carried smaller bows, a few of inferior elm rather than yew. Nearly all wore leather bracers on one arm, finger guards on the hand of the other. Their bows were strung ready for use.<br>&nbsp;<br>The men were being shepherded into rows of ten by a middle-aged soldier with a square face, a short black beard and a sternly disapproving expression. He was resplendent in the uniform of the London Trained Bands, a white doublet with sleeves and upper hose slashed to reveal the red lining beneath, and a round, polished helmet.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over two hundred yards away stood the butts, turfed earthen mounds six feet high. Here men eligible for service were supposed to practise every Sunday. Squinting, I made out a straw dummy, dressed in tatters of clothing, fixed there, a battered helmet on its head and a crude French fleur-de-lys painted on the front. I realized this was another View of Arms, that more city men were having their skills tested to select those who would be sent to the armies converging on the coast or to the King&#x2019;s ships. I was glad that, as a hunchback of forty-three, I was exempt from military service.<br>&nbsp;<br>A plump little man on a fine grey mare watched the men shuffling into place. The horse, draped in City of London livery, wore a metal face plate with holes for its eyes that made its head resemble a skull. The rider wore half-armour, his arms and upper body encased in polished steel, a peacock feather in his wide black cap stirring in the breeze. I recognized Edmund Carver, one of the city&#x2019;s senior aldermen; I had won a case for him in court two years before. He looked uneasy in his armour, shifting awkwardly on his horse. He was a decent enough fellow, from the Mercers&#x2019; Guild, whose main interest I remembered as fine dining. Beside him stood two more soldiers in Trained Bands uniform, one holding a long brass trumpet and the other a halberd. Nearby a clerk in a black doublet stood, a portable desk with a sheaf of papers set on it slung round his neck.<br>&nbsp;<br>The soldier with the halberd laid down his weapon and picked up half a dozen leather arrowbags. He ran along the front row of recruits, spilling out a line of arrows on the ground. The soldier in charge was still casting sharp, appraising eyes over the men. I guessed he was a professional officer, such as I had encountered on the King&#x2019;s Great Progress to York four years before. He was probably working with the Trained Bands now, a corps of volunteer soldiers set up in London a few years ago who practised soldiers&#x2019; craft at week&#x2019;s end.<br>&nbsp;<br>He spoke to the men, in a loud, carrying voice. &#x2018;England needs men to serve in her hour of greatest peril! The French stand ready to invade, to rain down fire and destruction on our women and children. But we remember Agincourt!&#x2019; He paused dramatically: Carver shouted, &#x2018;Ay!&#x2019;, followed by the recruits.<br>&nbsp;<br>The officer continued. &#x2018;We know from Agincourt that one Englishman is worth three Frenchmen, and we shall send our legendary archers to meet them! Those chosen today will get a coat, and thruppence a day!&#x2019; His tone hardened. &#x2018;Now we shall see which of you lads have been practising weekly as the law requires, and which have not. Those who have not &#x2013; &#x2019; he paused for dramatic effect &#x2013; &#x2018;may find themselves levied instead to be pikemen, to face the French at close quarters! So don&#x2019;t think a weak performance will save you from going to war.&#x2019; He ran his eye over the men, who shuffled and looked uneasy. There was something heavy and angry in the officer&#x2019;s dark-bearded face.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Now,&#x2019; he called, &#x2018;when the trumpet sounds again, each man will shoot six arrows at the target, as fast as you can, starting with the left of the front row. We&#x2019;ve prepared a dummy specially for you, so you can pretend it&#x2019;s a Frenchy come to ravish your mothers, if you have mothers!&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>I glanced at the watching crowd. There were excited urchins and some older folk of the poorer sort, but also several anxious-looking young women, maybe wives or sweethearts of the men called here.<br>&nbsp;<br>The soldier with the trumpet raised it to his lips and blew again. The first man, a thickset, handsome young fellow in a leather jerkin, stepped forward confidently with his warbow. He picked up an arrow and nocked it to the bow. Then in a quick, fluid movement he leaned back, straightened, and sent the arrow flying in a great arc across the wide space. It thudded into the fleur-de-lys on the scarecrow with a force that made it judder like a living thing. In no more than a minute he had strung and loosed five more arrows, all of which hit the dummy. There was a ragged cheer from the children. He smiled and flexed his broad shoulders.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Not bad!&#x2019; the officer called grudgingly. &#x2018;Go and get your name registered!&#x2019; The new recruit walked over to the clerk, waving his warbow at the crowd.<br>&nbsp;<br>A tall, loose-limbed young fellow in a white shirt, who looked barely twenty, was next. He had only an elm bow, and an anxious look. I noticed he wore neither bracer nor finger guard. The officer looked at him grimly as he pushed a hank of untidy blond hair from his eyes, then bent, took an arrow, and fitted it to the string. He pulled the bow back with obvious effort and loosed. The arrow fell well short, thudding into the grass. Pulling the bow had set him offbalance and he nearly fell, hopping on one leg for a moment and making the children laugh.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second arrow went wide, embedding itself in the side of the butts, and the young man cried out, doubling over with pain and holding one hand with the other. Blood trickled between his fingers. The officer gave him a grim look. &#x2018;Haven&#x2019;t been practising, have you? Can&#x2019;t even loose an arrow properly. You&#x2019;re going to the pikemen, you are! A tall fellow like you will be useful in close combat.&#x2019; The lad looked frightened. &#x2018;Come on,&#x2019; the officer shouted, &#x2018;you&#x2019;ve four more arrows still to loose. Never mind your hand. This crowd look like they could do with a laugh.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>I turned away. I had myself once been humiliated in front of a crowd and it was not something I relished seeing others endure.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Back in Gatehouse Court the flower seller was gone. I went into chambers, where my young clerk Skelly was copying out some orders in the outer office. He was bent closely over his desk, peering carefully at the document through his glasses.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;There is a View of Arms over at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields,&#x2019; I told him.<br>&nbsp;<br>He looked up. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve heard the Trained Bands have to find a thousand men for the south coast,&#x2019; he said in his quiet voice. &#x2018;Do you think the French are really going to invade, sir?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, Skelly.&#x2019; I smiled reassuringly. &#x2018;But you won&#x2019;t be called. You&#x2019;ve a wife and three children, and you need your glasses to see.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;So I hope and pray, sir.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I am sure.&#x2019; But these days one never knew.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Is Barak not back from Westminster?&#x2019; I asked, glancing over at my assistant&#x2019;s vacant desk. I had sent him to the Requests Office to lodge some depositions.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;No, sir.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>I frowned. &#x2018;I hope Tamasin is all right.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Skelly smiled. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure it is only a delay getting a wherry on the river, sir. You know how busy it is with supply boats.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Perhaps. Tell Barak to come and see me when he returns. I must go back to my papers.&#x2019; I went through to my office, little doubting Skelly thought me over-anxious. But Barak and his wife Tamasin were dear friends. Tamasin was expecting a baby in two months, and her first child had been born dead. I dropped into my chair with a sigh and picked up the particulars of a claim I had been reading earlier. My eyes wandered again to the letter on the corner of the desk. I made myself look away, but soon my thoughts returned to the View of Arms: I thought of invasion, of those young men ripped apart and slaughtered in battle.<br>&nbsp;<br>I looked out of the window, then smiled and shook my head as I saw the tall, skinny figure of my old enemy, Stephen Bealknap, walking across the sunlit court. He had acquired a stoop now, and in his black barrister&#x2019;s robe and white coif he looked like a huge magpie, seeking worms on the ground.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bealknap suddenly straightened and stared ahead, and I saw Barak walking across the court towards him, his leather bag slung over one shoulder. I noticed my assistant&#x2019;s stomach bulged now against his green doublet. His face was acquiring a little plumpness too that softened his features and made him look younger. Bealknap turned and walked rapidly away towards the chapel. That strange, miserly man had, two years ago, got himself indebted to me for a small amount. Normally bold as brass, Bealknap, for whom it was a point of pride never to part with money, would turn and hasten away if ever he saw me. It was a standing joke at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn. Evidently he was avoiding Barak ...</p><h2>The Art of Gaman: Arts and Crafts from the Japanese American Internment Camps 1942-1946</h2><p>In 1942, Executive Order 9066 mandated the incarceration of 110,000 Japanese Americans, including men, women, children, the elderly, and the infirm, for the duration of the war. Allowed only what they could carry, they were given just a few days to settle their affairs and report to assembly centers. Businesses were lost, personal property was stolen or vandalized, and lives were shattered. The Japanese word gaman means &#34;enduring what seems unbearable with dignity and grace. &#34;Imprisoned in remote camps surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by soldiers with machine guns, the internees sought courage and solace in art. Using found materials at first and later what they could order by catalog, they whittled and carved, painted and etched, stitched and crocheted. What they created is a celebration of the nobility of the human spirit under adversity.

Whether we were discussing and debating at the dinner table, teaching in a small-group setting, or sharing with someone who doesn&#x2019;t know the Lord, the Bible has been very near and dear to our family. Like every family, we get busy with life and need regular reminders to read, meditate on God&#x2019;s Word, and apply it to our daily lives. Because our family understands this need, we wanted to write a daily devotional book to help guide others to the life-changing power found in Scripture.<br> <br>Dad&#x2019;s parents, Granny and Pa, helped us buy our home place on the river and lived next door to us when Dad became a Christian. They were retiring and wanted to fish, hunt, grow gardens, and be close to family in their later years. They also had a divine appointment to teach our family a lot of scripture. God knew that our family needed them nearby to help guide our young family in our Christian walk. They were totally committed to studying the Bible and shared so much of what they discovered with our whole family. Forty years ago, our two homes on the Ouachita River were guided by the Scripture, and that foundation has now grown to seven homes, with many more on the horizon as the Robertson family continues to grow. This book is really dedicated to Granny and Pa and the legacy they continue to grow in us concerning our love for the Bible.<br> <br>We are all very excited about sharing some of our favorite passages and why they are special to us. You&#x2019;ll find that some of the chosen passages are repeated by other family members&#x2014;that&#x2019;s because some of the same passages have significantly impacted different people in our family. If you have watched our television show, you know how much we like to talk and expound on things, and this devotional book is no different. You will find some lengthy passages that don&#x2019;t need a lot said about them because there isn&#x2019;t much to add to the power that God has instilled. You&#x2019;ll also find other passages that spark a memory from our past, a challenge for our present, or a hope for our future. It is our prayer that those sentiments will bless your day and your spiritual walk.<br> <br>We encourage you to read through the passage, message, and prayer more than once during the day and allow God&#x2019;s Word to bless you and guide you in your daily walk with Him. We also challenge you to change whatever needs to be changed in your life to act in line with the truth of God&#x2019;s Word. God says that his Word is active and sharp and was written to impact, shape, and transform lives and lifestyles.<br> <br>If ever there was a time in our world that we needed to be guided by the principles of the Bible, it is now. So many people in the world are struggling for answers to their life issues, and the best guide and most absolute truth available is still the Holy Bible. We invite you to spend a year with our family. As we walk through passages from God&#x2019;s holy words of truth and light, you will be blessed by the journey.</p><h2>One False Move (Myron Bolitar Mysteries)</h2><p>Myron Bolitar is a hotheaded sports agent with a fierce wit, a taste for Yoo-Hoo, and a penchant for falling into jobs he doesn't want--think of him as Jerry Maguire as a reluctant private eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this remarkable novel by Edgar Award-winning author Harlan Coben, Myron is asked to keep an eye on the star of the new women's basketball league who's been receiving threats on her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Myron takes on the seemingly innocuous task, figuring he'll pick up the star as a new client.&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon her beauty and her quiet strength have him falling for her terrible story--the mother who disappeared twenty years before and the father who was recently discovered murdered--as he moves headlong into a case that prevails against his own better judgment, maybe to win her heart, maybe to save his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is at the end of a narrow trail of lies, lust, and murder, where one false move can cost both of them their lives.<br><br>Combining riveting suspense, quick wit, and relentless energy, Coben proves he's at the top of his game with this endlessly entertaining and totally inescapable novel.</p><p>As readers who have enjoyed his appearances in original paperbacks already know, Harlan Coben's former professional basketball star Myron Bolitar is not your everyday testosterone-enriched jock. Myron is a mild-mannered guy who drinks chocolate soda and until very recently lived at home with his parents in suburban New Jersey. In his hardcover debut, we find Myron sharing a New York apartment with his longtime lady friend, writer Jessica Culver, and still running MB SportsReps, where he ostensibly manages the careers of other athletes, but really spends most of his time playing private eye. The arrival in Myron's life of rising pro basketball star Brenda Slaughter seriously tests his commitment to Jessica, who is in Hollywood working on a movie. It seems that Brenda's father Horace--Myron's old coach--has disappeared, and Brenda is receiving death threats that might involve a gangster family's plans for a new female professional basketball league. Or the threats might have something to do with Brenda's mother's connection to a wealthy New Jersey political family. Myron and his banker friend Win, a preppy with a penchant for violence, are more than enough to double-team the bad guys.

When her husband is assigned to a larger and more demanding community in the Florida panhandle, Dean becomes fast friends with Augusta Holderfield, a woman whose good looks and extravagant habits immediately entrance her. As their friendship evolves, Augusta challenges Dean to break free from her traditional role as the preacher&#39;s wife. Just as Dean is questioning everything she has always valued, a tragedy occurs, providing the catalyst for change in ways she never could have imagined.</p><p><strong>Cassandra King</strong> is the author of <em>The Sunday Wife</em>, <em>The Same Sweet Girls</em>, <em>Making Waves</em> and <em>Queen of Broken Hearts</em>.

Laura Hicks delivers King's insightful novel with warmth, humor, and a dash of Southern charm. She interprets the upbeat and down-in-the-mouth emotions of minister's wife Dean Lynch in a plainspoken tongue and lends an appropriately glorified tone to Dean's husband and the other ministers. Listeners will laugh aloud at Hicks's depictions of the adversarial, yet just-too-sweet Libby and Vanna Fay. When Sylvia Hiney Whiney speaks, those who listen while driving should pull over. Hicks characterizes a diverse group of other Floridians, including a young boy, a stroke victim, and a Romanian fortune-teller, with believable vocalizations.

They are all versions of a bigger question: how do you live? How do you do the good or honourable thing, while flourishing and feeling happy?<br><br>This question obsessed Renaissance writers, none more than Michel Eyquem de Montaigne (1533-92), perhaps the first truly modern individual. A nobleman, public official and wine-grower, he wrote free-roaming explorations of his thought and experience, unlike anything written before. He called them 'essays', meaning 'attempts' or 'tries'. Into them he put whatever was in his head: his tastes in wine and food, his childhood memories, the way his dog's ears twitched when it was dreaming, as well as the appalling events of the religious civil wars raging around him. <b>The Essays</b> was an instant bestseller, and over four hundred years later, Montaigne's honesty and charm still draw people to him. Readers come to him in search of companionship, wisdom and entertainment&nbsp;&#x2014; and in search of themselves.<br><br>This book, a spirited and singular biography (and the first full life of Montaigne in English for nearly fifty years), relates the story of his life by way of the questions he posed and the answers he explored. It traces his bizarre upbringing (made to speak only Latin), youthful career and sexual adventures, his travels, and his friendships with the scholar and poet Etienne de La Bo�tie and with his adopted 'daughter', Marie de Gournay. And as we read, we also meet his readers&nbsp;&#x2014; who for centuries have found in Montaigne an inexhaustible source of answers to the haunting question, 'how to live?'</p><p>SARAH BAKEWELL had a wandering childhood in Europe, Australia and England. After studying at the University of Essex, she was a curator of early printed books at the Wellcome Library before becoming a full-time writer, publishing her highly acclaimed biographies <b>The Smart </b>and<b> The English Dane</b>. She lives in London, where she teaches creative writing at City University and catalogues rare book collections for the National Trust.The riding accident, which so altered Montaigne&#x2019;s perspective, lasted only a few moments in itself, but one can unfold it into three parts and spread it over several years. First, there is Montaigne lying on the ground, clawing at his stomach while experiencing euphoria. Then comes Montaigne in the weeks and months that followed, reflecting on the experience and trying to reconcile it with his philosophical reading. Finally, there is Montaigne a few years later, sitting down to write about it &#x2013; and about a multitude of other things. The first scene could have happened to anyone; the second to any sensitive, educated young man of the Renaissance. The last makes Montaigne unique.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The connection is not a simple one: he did not sit up in bed and immediately start writing about the accident. He began the <i>Essays</i> a couple of years later, around 1572, and, even then, he wrote other chapters before coming to the one about losing consciousness. When he did turn to it, however, the experience made him try a new kind of writing, barely attempted by other writers: that of re-creating a sequence of sensations as they felt from the inside, following them from instant to instant.</p><h2>The Sea, the Storm, and the Mangrove Tangle</h2><p><p><b>A look into a unique ecosystem, one that is endangered in many places</b></p><p>A seed is jostled from a branch of a mangrove tree and floats to a lagoon in the Caribbean Sea. It takes root, sprouts leaves, and slowly begins to grow. Over many years, the mangrove will provide a home and nourishment for numerous creatures of land and sea. Among its roots come to live fiddler crabs and shrimp; in its branches dwell lizards and hummingbirds. Soon the tree is dropping seeds of its own, and other mangroves are growing, creating a tangle whose benefits extend even to large mammals like dolphins and manatees. There are endpaper maps that indicate where mangroves are located and the names of common animals and plants found in them.</p><p>Ever threatened by hurricanes and even more by human destruction, the mangroves of our planet are endangered, but in Lynne Cherry's richly illustrated story one such habitat survives, giving readers hope and inspiration for preservation of these ecosystems in the real world.</p></p><p><p><b>Lynne Cherry</b> is the author and illustrator of many books for children, including <i>The Great Kapok Tree</i> and <i>A River Ran Wild</i>. She lives in Thurmond, Maryland.</p>Grade 1-3&#x2013;Using a beautifully balanced format that combines panoramic illustrations with a storylike narrative, Cherry imagines the life cycle of a mangrove over a period of more than 100 years, from propagules (sprouting seeds) to a single tree to a tangle (a cluster of trees) to an island. As the unusual tree slowly increases in size, it sends out dozens of visible prop roots that anchor it to the sea floor at the edge of a Caribbean lagoon and becomes both shelter and food source for an amazing array of living things. Richly hued watercolor-and-colored-pencil paintings show birds, fish, and sea creatures in sufficient detail to allow for easy identification. The endpapers feature maps of mangroves around the world surrounded by borders containing a small, labeled painting of each species. An introduction and author's note explain the importance of mangroves to their ecosystem and encourage their preservation. Although Cherry has chosen to anthropomorphize a few of the animals by including snippets of conversation, the information is well researched and clearly presented, and the lesson in ecology is an important one.<i>&#x2013;Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is a professor at the School of Politics at the University of Nottingham. He lives in England.Though he created both the ideas and the first canvases of the cubist movement, Georges Braque is frequently overshadowed by his celebrated colleague Pablo Picasso. English critic Danchev's detailed biography, the first full-length study of Braque, reveals the reason why: Braque was that rare artist who was just as happy working and producing as seeking glory, an individual who didn't require the fawning attention that others, like Picasso, seemed to subsist on. Braque's friendship with Picasso is extensively explored and, although their relationship had slight sexual undertones (Picasso liked to refer to Braque as his "wife," and he "pursued Braque as relentlessly as he did any woman... over a far longer period"), Danchev makes it clear that their friendship was based on artistic affinity more than anything else. Intriguing revelations about Braque's much-protected private life abound, including discussions of his military service and his unswervingly faithful marriage to Marcelle Vorvanne. Danchev's intimate, conversational tone may put off readers with a preference for more formal biographies, but those with a penchant for lively prose and some familiarity with art history terminology will relish Danchev's meticulous contribution to the study of cubism.

Sara Hagerty found him when life stopped working for her. She found him when she was a young adult mired in spiritual busyness and when she was a new bride with doubts about whether her fledgling marriage would survive. She found him alone in the night as she cradled her longing for babies who did not come. She found him as she kissed the faces of children on another continent who had lived years without a mommy&#x2019;s touch.</p><p>In Every Bitter Thing Is Sweet, Hagerty masterfully draws from the narrative of her life to craft a mosaic of a God who leans into broken stories. Here readers see a God who is present in every changing circumstance. Most significantly, they see a God who is present in every unchanging circumstance as well.</p><p>Whatever lost expectations readers are facing&#x2015;in family, career, singleness, or marriage&#x2015;Every Bitter Thing Is Sweet will bring them closer to a God who longs for them to know him more. What does it look like to know God&#x2019;s nearness when life breaks? What does it mean to receive his life when earthly life remains barren? How can God turn the bitterness of unmet desire into new flavors of joy?</p><p>With exquisite storytelling and reflection, Hagerty brings readers back to hope, back to healing, back to a place that God is holding for them alone&#x2015;a place where the unseen is more real than what the eye can perceive. A place where every bitter thing is sweet.</p></p><p><p>Sara Hagerty is the author of <em>Every Bitter Thing Is Sweet</em>, a wife to Nate, and a mother of six, including four children adopted from Africa and one toddler who&#x2019;s found his voice amid them all.

But today's listeners must choose between classical and rock, opera and rap, and the choices can seem overwhelming at times. In <i>The Essential Canon of Classical Music</i>, David Dubal comes to the aid of the struggling listener and provides a cultural-literacy handbook for classical music. Dubal identifies the 240 composers whose works are most important to an understanding of classical music and offers a comprehensive, chronological guide to their lives and works. He has searched beyond the traditional canon to introduce readers to little-known works by some of the most revered names in classical music-Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert-as well as to the major works of lesser-known composers. In a spirited and opinionated voice, Dubal seeks to rid us of the notion of "masterpieces" and instead to foster a new generation of master listeners. The result is an uncommon collection of the wonders classical music has to offer.<br></p><p><b>David Dubal</b> is an acclaimed pianist and a professor at the Julliard School. He has won several awards, including the Peabody Award and an Emmy for the documentary <i>The Golden Age of the Piano</i>. The former classical music program director at WNCN, Dubal is currently a broadcaster on WQXR. He is also the author of many books.<br><b>Excerpt from<i> The Essential Canon of Classical Music </i></b><br><br>We can only speculate about the origins of music, but its seemingly magical qualities must have been apparent early in human prehistory. Primitive music of some sort probably preceded speech by thousands of years. Those with unusual vocal abilities may have used their power in rituals or to convey messages over a distance. These ancient singers, like their brothers the cave painters, may even have been privileged members of the clan. But it was a long time before people started making vocal utterances in intervals, thus creating melodies that could be repeated again and again. <br><br>The first musical instrument, if you can call it that, was the pursed lips of a whistler (no doubt first used in an attempt to imitate bird calls). Early peoples thereafter developed banging, twanging, and scraping instruments, most of which were used, with the dance, to practice magical and sexual rites and to worship the sun and the moon. Charles Darwin was convinced "that musical notes and rhythm were first acquired by the male or female progenitors of mankind for the sake of charming the opposite sex." <br><br>As the concept of pitch developed, those with good musical ears could start to imitate sounds. The pitches they heard, however, were not those that we have come to know. Each area of the world developed a different vocabulary of sounds. We do not know who the first musical geniuses were, or when they first organized sound into a musical form. How interesting it would be to go back in time and hear the music used for prehistoric funeral and marital rites, or the humming and singing (if any) that accompanied hunting and gathering! <br><br>Our knowledge of music in ancient civilizations is little better than that in the prehistoric world. We know very little about Egypt, and only a little more about the strides made in India, Persia, and the Far East. The five-tone or pentatonic scale was first developed in China around three thousand years ago. In ancient Greece music was almost held sacred, and the mythological musician Orpheus was feted. Pythagoras realized that music had healing agents, but Plato found it dangerous and enervating. The Greeks made great advances in musical theory, developing scales or modes; but only a few fragments of their music survive. This gifted civilization was probably the most musically expressive up to that time. <br><br>It was with the emergence of Christianity that the Western musical tradition began. Gregorian chant, named for Pope Gregory the Great (d. 604), had its roots in Jewish liturgical chants. In addition, psalmody, hymns, antiphons, and so forth became part of a common liturgy that spread through the Christian world. For several hundred years after Gregory, theory and practice slowly evolved together (for creativity could not blossom until theoretical problems were solved). <br><br>The Middle Ages saw the birth of polyphony, a revolutionary new form of music based on two or more parts, or melodic lines. Polyphony made possible the mass, the chief musical ritual of the Roman Catholic Church. It also saw the birth of a secular musical tradition, alongside the liturgical. Wandering minstrels, known as troubadours, based their popular melodies on poems of courtly love. They made creative use of new musical instruments to accompany their chivalric stanzas, which were usually written in the vernacular languages and not in Latin. <br><br>The vernacular was making rapid progress in the other arts, especially after 1300, when both Dante and Petrarch started to write verse in Italian. Their poems expressed emotional states not previously addressed by the arts. (Petrarch, for example, dedicated his sonnets to his lady love, Laura.) Music could not yet rival the flexibility of poetry, but Petrarch's contemporary Guillaume de Machaut brought music to a new rhythmic complexity through syncopation. Like other composers, he worked for the Church, but in his ballades he codified a new type of secular song in courtly language, accompanied by an instrument, with sections of ornamental freedom. The ballade form would retain its popularity for a century. <br><br>As it did with the other arts, Italy, the cradle of the Renaissance, developed a flourishing musical culture, especially after 1450. While Giovanni Bellini was painting his incomparable madonnas, Italians were reveling in madrigals, a mostly secular polyphonic form using two to as many as eight vocal parts. In the humanistic Renaissance, as one scholar put it, "music was not a set of compositional techniques but a complex of social conditions, intellectual states of mind, attitudes, aspirations, habits of performers, artistic support systems, intracultural communication, and many other ingredients which add up to a thriving matrix of musical energy." Beauty in art and craft was a highly valued element of life. The artist of the Renaissance was in fact more integrated into general society than he would ever be again. <br><br>Italian and English musicians were artists of the highest cultivation. Performances were constant and lively, and for the first time notated music was <br>f0published. New instruments were created in abundance and were of exceptional beauty in their ornaments: organs, harpsichords, cornetti, shawms (forerunners of the oboe), sackbuts (early trombones), viols (cousins of the modern violin, cello, and viola), flutes, lutes, and dozens of others. Like many noblemen, Henry VIII of England, who considered himself a fine composers had a splendid collection of instruments (nearly four hundred by 1530). <br><br>By the late sixteenth century, any person of rank or pretension was expected to have musical proficiency. Most were excellent sight-readers. The reign of Elizabeth (1558-1603) was a golden age for the arts, and music thrived in the home, at church, and in the theater. Shakespeare used song prolifically in his plays and showed not only his love for the art but his knowledge of it. He may have played the recorder. In his 128th sonnet, he wrote of "jacks" that part of the virginal (keyboard) action that makes possible the plucking of the strings: <br><br><i>I envy those jacks that nimble leap </i><br><i>To kiss the tender inward of thy hand. </i><br><br>In Italy madrigals continued to rule the secular musical scene in the later Renaissance. Both Claudio Monteverdi and Carlo Gesualdo provided greatness to this form. The madrigal is the neglected glory of the Renaissance. Two close contemporaries, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Orlande de Lassus, were giants: Palestrina's masses, with their beautiful euphony, are among music's purest, most angelic manifestations. The versatile master Lassus fulfilled the motet form, the villanella, and the chanson. These and many composers in other lands -- such as the Swiss Ludwig Senfl, the Dutchman Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, the Spaniard Tom�s Luis de Victoria, and the Englishman William Byrd -- make the sixteenth century a time of high musical adventurousness. Composers had never had more options in vocal and instrumental expression. Most of all, conflicts between polyphony and melody grew. At the end of the sixteenth century, a group of Florentine dilettantes, poets, and musicians plotted the germ of a new art form. They rejected polyphony as unsuited to accompany song in drama. Jacopo Peri's Dafne (1598) may be called the first drama to be completely set to music. It signaled the birth of opera -- and of the Baroque era. <br><br>Copyright � 2001 David Dubal <br><br>--From <i>The Essential Canon of Classical Music, </i>by David Dubal (Illustrator). � October 2001 , North Point Press used by permission.<br><br></p><h2>The Black Book of Colours</h2><p>Black Book of Colours</p><p>Menena Cottin is a graphic designer and illustrator from Caracas, Venezuela.

Meant to be experienced with the fingers instead of the eyes, this extraordinary book allows sighted readers to experience colors the way blind people do: through the other senses. The text, in both print and Braille, presents colors through touch (yellow is "as soft as a baby chick's feathers"), taste (red "as sweet as watermelon"), smell ("green smells like grass that's just been cut"), and sound (brown "crunches...like fall leaves"). Far�a's distinctive illustrations present black shapes embossed on a black background for readers to feel instead of see. One page even describes a rainbow. A guide to the Braille alphabet appears at the end of the book. Fascinating, beautifully designed, and possessing broad child appeal, this book belongs on the shelves of every school or public library committed to promoting disability awareness and accessibility.

Among the best cookbooks exploring this rich, tantalizing cuisine is chef-restaurateur Su-Mei Yu's <i>Cracking the Coconut</i>. Insisting that there can be no true Thai cooking without homemade "core" preparations (such as various chili pastes), Yu includes precise, accessible recipes for these and other essential ingredients while outlining fundamental techniques in vivid detail. Readers learn the proper hand motions for cracking a coconut, how to wrap ingredients in banana leaves, and how to work a mortar and pestle, the central Thai-kitchen implement. The book's 175 recipes are divided between chapters devoted to essential ingredients or dishes. The chapter on Thai curry ("the signature dish") explores the basics of preparing this exciting fare and includes such delicious recipes as Red Curry with Roasted Pork and Green Banana and Sweet Green Curry with Meatballs. A chapter called "The Secret of Thai Salads" offers recipes for a small repertoire of essential dressings and such tempting recipes as Apricot, Shrimp, and Pork Salad and a salad-feast called, simply, Lamb and Roast Duck. Yu provides cultural notes and cooking lore throughout the book, often drawing from her recipe-hunting travels abroad. It's hard to imagine a better start for anyone wishing to "cook Thai" than this fully illustrated book, which perfectly balances recipes and instruction to make it an innovative standout. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i><p>Su-Mei Yu is chef-owner of the acclaimed Saffron restaurant in San Diego, California. Born of Chinese parents in Thailand, at the age of five she was enrolled in an exclusive boarding school founded by the Royal Court of Thailand. At age fifteen, Yu came to an American mission boarding school in Kentucky. After graduation, she received a master's degree in social welfare. After twelve years as a social worker, she joined the graduate school of social work at San Diego State University as an assistant professor. In 1985 Yu opened the first Thai restaurant in San Diego.</p></p><h2>Mandie and the Forbidden Attic (Mandie, Book 4)</h2><p>Mandie and her new friend investigate mysterious noises in the school attic which lead to a surprising discovery and a deepening of Mandie&#39;s Christian faith</p><p>Lois began her first Mandie story when she was only eleven years old.

All of them led with courage &#x2014; but also with great optimism. The pope helped ordinary Poles and East Europeans banish their fear of Soviet Communism, convincing them that liberation was possible. The prime minister restored her country's failing economy by reviving the "vigorous virtues" of the British people. The president rebuilt America's military power, its national morale, and its pre &#x2013; eminence as leader of the free world. Together they brought down an evil empire and changed the world for the better. No one can tell their intertwined story better than John O'Sullivan, former editor of <i>National Review</i> and the <i>Times of London</i>, who knew all three and conducted exclusive interviews that shed extraordinary new light on these giants of the twentieth century.</p><p>They Changed the Course of History <p>They were three "middle managers" no one imagined could reach the top. </p><p>Ronald Reagan was too old to be president and too conservative anyway. Margaret Thatcher was not only too conservative she was a woman, and not on anyone's short list to lead Britain's Conservative Party. And the idea of a Polish pope that was truly absurd, especially when the cardinal in question was a strong anti-Communist and defender of orthodoxy when many in the Church and throughout the world believed the future belonged to d�tente with the Soviets and social liberalism in the West. </p><p>Not only did Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and Karol Wojtyla (the future John Paul II) rise to the top, but all three of them also survived assassination attempts, collaborated in the miraculous peaceful liberation of Eastern Europe from Soviet Communism, and reinvigorated their respective countries and the West. They were beacons of optimism cutting through the malaise and despair that afflicted 1970s America, strike-ridden and economically moribund post-imperial Britain, and a Catholic Church rocked by social and sexual revolutions. </p><p>In The President, the Pope, and the Prime Minister, veteran journalist and former Thatcher speechwriter John O'Sullivan reveals: </p><p>&#x25cf; How Reagan, Thatcher, and John Paul developed as strong and individual leaders, perfectly suited to take power when liberalism failed How John Paul's papal visit to Poland in June 1979 led to the birth of the Solidarity labor union </p><p>&#x25cf; How the pope's moral undermining of Communism worried the Soviet Politburo more than any military threat </p><p>&#x25cf; Why Thatcher's handling of the Falklands crisis was a turning point in the Cold War </p><p>&#x25cf; How Reagan arranged for the pope to receive U.S. intelligence on developments in the Soviet bloc </p><p>&#x25cf; Reagan's reluctant support for the nuclear "balance of terror" and how he gratefully adopted the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) as an effective alternative </p><p>&#x25cf; The Soviets' attempts to lure the pope into an anti-SDI campaign and his refusal </p><p>&#x25cf; How Reagan's refusal to compromise with Gorbachev in Reykjavik precipitated the unraveling of Soviet power </p><p>&#x25cf; How Reagan, Thatcher, and John Paul II restored optimism and hope to their people </p><p>Today, as we face a new and perhaps even deadlier enemy than Soviet Communism, we need to revisit the powerful lessons taught by these three great leaders who revived the faith, prosperity, and freedom of the West. </p><p>John O'Sullivan covered the Reagan presidency as a Washington columnist, was a special adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and has written regularly on Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church's influence on international relations.

To Bartley, the best way to ensure a bountiful future is to understand the forces responsible for the so-called seven fat years--the period from 1983-90 when America's GNP grew by almost one third in inflation-adjusted terms. Monetary and fiscal policy apart, the author attributes the long-lived recovery/expansion to, among other factors, the breakup of a domestic political stasis, the emergence of neoclassical economic theory, and a world-class communicator in the White House. (While the author doesn't dwell on it, his newspaper also played an influential role, cheering the business community in its efforts to overcome the stagflation of the 1970's.) By Bartley's account, the US could secure another boom by resuming the policies and practices that produced prosperity during the Reagan era. Not too surprisingly, he puts further tax cuts (to promote a renaissance of entrepreneurial enterprise) and spending curbs at the top of his agenda. As for perceived problems such as the federal budget deficit and the S&amp;L debacle, the author views them through a conservative's eyes, meaning he dismisses the one as irrelevant and attributes the other to venal lawmakers who kept regulatory authorities from doing their jobs in timely fashion. Bartley goes on to caution that if elitist opinion-makers insist on seeking atonement for putative excesses of the past in renewed intervention or other self-defeating courses, the country could well face seven lean years. He also warns that even the US can no longer isolate itself behind protectionist trade barriers from the Global Village's economy. Shrewd, informed commentary on the socioeconomic and political state of the union. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Wall Street Journal editor Bartley here extols economic policies of the Reagan years and calls for more of the same. Tracing the pre-Reagan "stagflation" produced by Nixon's price controls, Ford's WIN campaign and Carter's "voluntary" price guidelines, the author tracks how 1980s tax cuts and deregulation, combined with Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker's inflation-curbing money controls, unleashed American enterprise and boosted national production 30% with a 20% rise in per capita income. In extraordinary detail, and with frequent ironical jabs at the "unenlightened," Bartley analyzes (among other things) congressional economic attitudes (mostly awful), foreign trade debits (complex but necessary), the federal deficit (not to worry), the savings-and-loan debacle (the New Deal started it), mergers, acquisitions and junk bonds (not so bad, really) and the fallacy of "fairly" taxing the rich. He puts in a good word, too, for Jay Gould and other maligned 19th-century "robber barons" for their roles in our economic expansion. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Digressions on Some Poems by Frank O&#39;Hara: A Memoir</h2><p><b>An unprecedented eyewitness account of the New York School, as seen between the lines of O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s poetry</b><br><br>Joe LeSueur lived with Frank O&#x2019;Hara from 1955 until 1965, the years when O&#x2019;Hara wrote his greatest poems, including &#x201c;To the Film Industry in Crisis,&#x201d; &#x201c;In Memory of My Feelings,&#x201d; &#x201c;Having a Coke with You,&#x201d; and the famous Lunch Poems&#x2014;so called because O&#x2019;Hara wrote them during his lunch break at the Museum of Modern Art, where he worked as a curator. (The artists he championed include Jackson Pollock, Joseph Cornell, Grace Hartigan, Jane Freilicher, Joan Mitchell, and Robert Rauschenberg.) The flowering of O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s talent, cut short by a fatal car accident in 1966, produced some of the most exuberant, truly celebratory lyrics of the twentieth century. And it produced America&#x2019;s greatest poet of city life since Whitman.<br><br>Alternating between O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s poems and LeSueur&#x2019;s memory of the circumstances that inspired them, <i>Digressions on Some Poems by Frank O&#x2019;Hara</i> is a literary commentary like no other&#x2014;an affectionate, no-holds-barred memoir of O&#x2019;Hara and the New York that animated his work: friends, lovers, movies, paintings, streets, apartments, music, parties, and pickups. This volume, which includes many of O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s best-loved poems, is the most intimate, true-to-life portrait we will ever have of this quintessential American figure and his now legendary times.<br></p><p><b>Joe LeSueur </b>was a decorated soldier when he moved to New York in 1949, at the age of twenty-five. He held jobs as an editor, critic, and screenwriter. He died in 2001 in East Hampton.<br>Digressions on Some Poems by Frank O'Hara <br> WHO I AM AND WHERE I AM COMING FROM According to "Four Apartments," Frank and I met on New Year's Eve 1951 <i></i> at a party John Ashbery gave in his Greenwich Village apartment. Not so, it turns out, and it was John who set me straight--John, who has always been known for his infallible memory and for never being wrong about anything. But I had a more compelling reason for accepting his account of how Frank and I met. For when, in the spring of 1969 <i></i> not long after my memoir appeared in <i>The World,</i> he sidled up to me at a party downtown and asserted in that cool, confident manner of his, "Joe, you and Frank met earlier that fall at a concert," it was as if he had commanded, "Open, sesame!" Instantly, before he spoke another word, the door to the storehouse of my mind flew open and everything came back to me: my running into John during intermission at a Town Hall concert one Sunday afternoon in the fall of 1951 <i></i> his introducing me to someone with whom I barely had eye contact, and, just as the warning bell sounded, my introducing them to the person who had come with me--no, we could not have had a conversation, because that, through the years, would have kept the afternoon alive in my memory. And now, as John continued with his account of the concert, reminding me that it was a program of contemporary American music, I remembered the searing self-consciousness that had swept over me as we were exchanging introductions, my blushing as I was wont to do in those days, usually when I thought I was being admired or scrutinized, but on that occasion for an entirely different reason: I'd come to the concert with a black man who was physically unattractive, which could not have been said of any of the Negroes I went to bed with and was happy to be seen with. Was I aware how heinous it was of me to be ashamed of my companion? You bet, and I reproached myself even as I wondered what John and his friend made of him. Oddly, it didn't occur to me that John, being up on everything, would know him by name: he was Howard Swanson, whose Short Symphony had just wonthe Music Critics Circle Award, which meant that I, being vain and callow, could have taken pride in being seen with him, no matter that he was unprepossessing. As for John's friend, as to how he figured in all of this--again, I wasn't thinking; after all, this might be the only time we'd ever see each other, so on top of everything else it was ludicrous to care what he thought. And that wasn't all. As I'd learn in a couple of years, Frank had a predilection for black men that was so great, so inclusive, there was no way he could have entertained the notion that my companion wasn't <i>sortable--</i>or <i></i> as tacky queens said back then (the only equivalent for that Gallicism?), "not for streetwear." No doubt about it, we met at that Town Hall concert in the fall of 1951, and I suppose I should leave it at that--except I can't resist adding a proviso of sorts about another concert, an earlier one, where I may have caught my first glimpse of Frank, a likelihood that came to Frank's and my attention because of, albeit indirectly, an inane line of dialogue spoken by Joan Crawford in a 1941 movie called <i>A Woman's Face</i>. We'd just seen it on <i>The Late Late Show</i> at one of John Button's TV evenings, probably in 1958, and as we were turning in, we began tittering over the line that earlier had John, Jimmy Schuyler, and the two of us roaring with laughter. Conrad Veidt is playing the piano for Joan Crawford--tossing off a Chopin nocturne, if memory serves. "Do you like music?" he inquires, as though the question is one of great subtlety. "Some symphonies," she answers grandly, "and all piano concertos." To us, that was camp of a high order, so I was a little surprised when now, at home, Frank seemed to have changed his mind: he abruptly stopped laughing and allowed, quite seriously, that he knew how the Crawford character felt. "I have yet to hear a piano concerto I don't like'" he averred. I had no reason to disbelieve him, works like Paderewski's soupy Piano Concerto and Rachmaninoff's feeble Fourth being only two of the meretricious essays in the form I'd known him to sigh over. At the moment, however, I thought I knew of one piano concerto he wouldn't like. "What makes you think I haven't heard it?" he shot back when I proposed that possibility. "Because it can't have been played much since its first performance," I told him. "Whichyou heard," he put in. "Right," I said, "and I'll give you a hint. The pianist was the composer's wife." Frank said, straight off, "That could only have been Joanna Harris." "Very good," I said. "And Roy Harris gave his concerto the silliest title--" "The Pan-American Piano Concerto!" Frank broke in triumphantly. "It was played in Los Angeles in 1946, at the Wilshire-Ebell. And I loved it." "You were there?" I said in astonishment. "Just before my discharge from the navy," he said. "Wasn't Werner Janssen the conductor? He was married to Ann Harding, remember? Funny," he mused, "both of us being there before we knew each other." I thought a moment; I cast my mind back. "I remember seeing a sailor there that night," I said. "It was you, it had to be." Frank looked skeptical. "You were in the balcony," I continued, "three or four rows down from where I was sitting with a girlfriend from high school." He smiled, still unconvinced. "Of course I'd be in the balcony," he said. "It's all I could've afforded." As additional proof, I offered more details that admittedly may have come into my head through the power of suggestion. "You were alone, you arrived late, and you were the only sailor in the house," I told him. "Naturally, I'd be alone," he said. "It was hardly the sort of thing my buddies went to on leave." "I still think I saw you there that night," I insisted. Whether I did or not seems unimportant to me now, because the picture I hold in my mind's eye, of a slightly built sailor slipping discreetly into his seat as the house lights dim and the conductor strides to the podium, is as vivid and indelible, and therefore as true, as anything I'll be writing about in these pages. &nbsp; <br> Let us go back to "Four Apartments" and its assertion that I met Frank on New Year's Eve 1951, at a party given by John Ashbery. <i>Paul Goodman said</i>, <i>"There's a poet named Frank O'Hara I think you'll like," and led me across the room to him</i>. And that, of course, was my real introduction to Frank, the one that took. It led somewhere and for that reason became etched in my memory. At the time, Paul--the first intellectual, the first poet, and the first bohemianor nonconformist I ever got to know--was still in my life, still of some importance to me, and the hold he had over me, sporadic in the three years we'd known each other, came to an end once and for all when, by introducing me to Frank, he unwittingly turned me over to him. I don't mean to say I was a pickup with no will of my own, someone who was passed around, nor was I as deferential in my relations with Paul as might be inferred. Yet without question, I was unduly compliant and even submissive with friends I thought of, usually with justification, as superior to me in intelligence and accomplishment. Need it be added that I sought out exceptional people? I had since high school and I continued to do so through college and later, after I went to New York. While reflected glory was obviously what I sought, it could also be said that I was an intellectual climber, one with vague, pretentious notions about becoming a writer--which is to say, my desire to be a writer was not so much an ambition as a fantasy. When Paul Goodman and I met, or introduced ourselves, under circumstances that might strike some readers as disreputable, I was due to graduate from the University of Southern California in a month and a half. Understandably, it was a period in my life fraught with uncertainty, so that my tendency to be acquiescent and susceptible to influence was more pronounced than ever--surely, an opportune moment for this messianic figure to enter my life. Yet Paul and I wouldn't have gotten together, I wouldn't have been drawn to him in the first place, had it not been for another desire, a desire far more compelling than my addled ambition to be a writer. A classmate at school put his finger on it. "You're like Madame Bovary, languishing in the provinces," he kidded me, aware of my dissatisfaction with Los Angeles but not realizing his jest was no exaggeration. For just as poor Emma devoured sentimental novels, I was voracious since adolescence for anything that evoked New York--the gargantuan Sunday <i>New York Times</i> and the urbane <i>New Yorker,</i> which I pored over at the public library, and any book that had anything to do with New York. But at an even earlier age, when I was ten or eleven, I was having fantasies about big-city life that stemmed from movies set in Manhattan, most of them glossy M-G-M productions thatso often seemed to feature a long-suffering, rags-to-riches Joan Crawford (yes, her again!), with whom I identified for the simple reason that, having read in <i>Photoplay</i> that her real name was Lucille LeSueur, I had become convinced we were related. Before long, I deemed it my destiny to live in New York; there, and only there, would I find the glamorous and exciting life denied me in Highland Park, South Gate, Huntington Park, and Lynwood, the dreary communities of my childhood and adolescence. Why so many different places? Because my family, hard hit by the Depression, moved every two or three years in search of ever cheaper rentals. And with each move, my dissatisfaction grew along with my dreams of big-city life. But not until I was a senior in college did those dreams loom as an attainable reality--attainable because of the one-way, cross-country Greyhound Bus ticket I bought without telling anyone.

Pablo Echeverria, his skin a deep tan, his eyes the darkest brown, his hair almost to his shoulders, pushed back behind his ears, and his beard slightly overgrown, walked out of the hut where he and Paloma lived. She was expecting their first child, and the date was coming near. Paloma was as fair and light-skinned as he was dark, and her name suited her. In Spanish Paloma meant &#x201c;Dove.&#x201d; She was a bird of peace in the jungle where they lived and Pablo worked. He was her brother&#x2019;s right-hand man. Raul Vasquez Lopez was one of the most powerful men in Colombia, despite the simple way they lived. Pablo had been with him for three years, working his way up through the ranks since he had come from Ecuador, and gaining Raul&#x2019;s trust. They called Raul &#x201c;El Lobo,&#x201d; the Wolf. He was cunning, daring, and quick, like a wolf.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pablo was the son of an Ecuadorian general who had been killed in a military coup, assassinated by rebels. Pablo had turned to the drug trade, and after three years of working on a smaller scale in Ecuador, he had found his way to Raul. And the three years he had spent working for him since had been a satisfying and productive alliance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pablo and Paloma weren&#x2019;t married, and no one cared, he was planning to marry her soon, after the baby was born. For now, he and Raul had other things on their minds. Raul liked the idea of Pablo being with his younger sister. Pablo was not only smart, capable, and trustworthy, he was a good man. Paloma had had no medical care through the eight months of the pregnancy, but at nineteen she was fine. And she was planning to give birth at the camp. Pablo had been reading books about how to help her, and if things started to go wrong, he could drive her the two hours to Bogota. Her brother was twenty years older than she was, and Pablo was twenty-eight, young to have risen so high in Raul&#x2019;s operation, but Raul knew pure talent when he saw it, and his inquiries about Pablo in Ecuador had proved him right. He prided himself on his infallible judgment about his men, and Pablo had never let him down. He executed Raul&#x2019;s orders flawlessly, and handled their purchasing and transport operations brilliantly. There had been no problems, and no slips in the three years he&#x2019;d been there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Their simple life at the camp suited him. Pablo went to both Bogota and Cartagena for Raul regularly, but he was always happy to get back, meet with Raul, who was like a brother to him now, live with the other men, and come home to Paloma, waiting for him in their hut. He had built it for them himself. In his first year at the camp, he had lived in a military surplus tent with the other men, but once he was with Paloma, they wanted privacy and a space for themselves. She had grown up in Raul&#x2019;s camps, after their parents died. Her three other brothers worked for Raul as well. And Pablo had rapidly caught her eye, as she had inevitably caught his. Raul had defended her virtue fiercely until then. It was a sign of his deep respect for Pablo that he had entrusted her to him, and given him his consent. To Pablo, she was the ultimate prize. He loved the sweet scent of her skin as he nestled with her at night, her gentleness in all things, and her full belly now, heavy with their child. Raul wanted it to be a boy. Pablo didn&#x2019;t say it, but he didn&#x2019;t care. He just wanted it to go easily for her, and the baby to be healthy when it was born. She was a brave girl, used to the primitive conditions in which they lived, and said she wasn&#x2019;t afraid. Pablo could feel the baby kick him, when she slept behind him with an arm gently cast over him, in the cool night air of the jungle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pablo was wearing his old military jacket from Ecuador, with an undershirt, fatigue pants, and his old army boots, as he lit his first cigarette of the day, and took a long drag. He had slipped out, as he always did, without waking Paloma, and had his first cup of coffee with Raul every morning, while they discussed the missions of the day, and the state of their activities in process. They had dealings in Panama, Ecuador, Aruba, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Mexico, and exported literally tons of cocaine to Mexico, Canada, Africa, Europe, and the United States. Raul ran the largest and most successful drug operation in South America. They exported it by land, air, and sea via ships and speedboats out of Cartagena. Pablo was in charge of coordinating their transport operation at the highest level. While Raul ran everything from their camp, Pablo slipped quietly into the two cities, checked on operations, conveyed Raul&#x2019;s orders, and then came back to the camp to report to El Lobo, who ran his vast empire with military precision. Raul was a man worthy of respect and admiration, for the sheer efficiency with which he ran his business. And he had built it all himself, adding one piece of the giant operation to the next, until his arms encompassed much of South America. Pablo was his most trusted legman, but they all knew that Raul was the heart and soul and brains of their business, and ran it all on a grand scale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pablo finished the last of his cigarette as he walked into the clearing where Raul made camp. His tent was military and heavily camouflaged, but no one was ever sure where he slept at night. The location was always kept secret even from Pablo, although they met at his tent in the morning to discuss work. But the joke in the camp was that El Lobo slept with the other wolves. The women he slept with were temporary and of no consequence to him, he considered them more of a liability than an asset, and he teased Pablo that he didn&#x2019;t have his romantic ideas. But it was a weakness he tolerated in him, since it benefited his sister, and Pablo treated her well. Raul was all about business, nothing else mattered to him, except the loyalty of his men. He considered their total dedication to him a sacred trust. And those who failed him in some way rapidly disappeared. Their families, attachments to women, and personal lives were of no interest to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was smoking a Romeo y Julieta limited edition Havana cigar, as he did every morning, when Pablo arrived. He offered one to Pablo from the box on his desk every day, and Pablo always declined. He smoked a cigar with Raul sometimes before he went home at night, but didn&#x2019;t have the stomach for it first thing in the morning. But he liked the familiar, pungent smell when he walked into the tent, and often brought the cigars for Raul from Bogot�. They were common here, for men like Raul. Despite the way he lived in order to run his business, he was a man of distinguished tastes. He had been educated in Europe, and had gone to Oxford for two years. It made for interesting conversations with Pablo, when they shared a brandy and a cigar late at night. Pablo had been well educated too, from a respectable family. It gave them something more in common than the business interests they shared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The moment Raul saw Pablo, there was a brotherly light in his eyes. He clapped him on the shoulder, and they embraced. The two men even looked somewhat alike, although Pablo was younger and taller and in flawless shape. Their coloring was similar, as was their military style.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How is my fat sister?&#x201d; Raul said, teasing him, as Pablo helped himself to the strong dark brew of coffee that Raul made himself, and drank gallons of, every day. His coffee cup was never empty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Getting bigger,&#x201d; Pablo said proudly. &#x201c;I think it will be soon.&#x201d; He was mildly worried about it, but knew better than to say it to Raul, who called him an old woman when he did. Raul knew that Pablo&#x2019;s soft spot was Paloma, which he always considered a dangerous thing. It was why he never allied himself with any woman, he just used them. He thought women were too risky for that reason, and easily became an Achilles&#x2019; heel, but it was a flaw he forgave Pablo, only because Paloma was his sister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Raul had been sitting, looking at a table full of maps and a list of transport ships, when Pablo walked in. He pushed the list toward Pablo as soon as he sat down, pointing the cigar in the direction of the maps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So what do you think? We ship to North Africa tomorrow? And Europe at the end of the week?&#x201d; He liked to keep things moving and not let the shipments sit for too long after they came in. They had gotten a huge shipment in Cartagena from their supplier the day before, and he wanted to get it out quickly. Despite what they paid in bribes to government officials at all levels, El Lobo knew better than to let the goods sit in warehouses longer than they had to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds right,&#x201d; Pablo said, studying the maps. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why we can&#x2019;t ship to Europe tomorrow too. Why wait till the end of the week?&#x201d; He pointed to the name of a ship that was smaller than the others but had served them well before. &#x201c;And Miami, when the next shipment comes in.&#x201d; Raul nodded. Pablo always planned ahead and was as careful as Raul was himself about moving and storing the goods. They wanted to ship it out as fast as they could on ships they knew were safe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As they discussed the details and mechanics of it, four other men walked in. Two were in camouflage, the other two in garb similar to what Raul and Pablo wore. They were the silent army of the dark side. And a few minutes later, six more men arrived in the tent, awaiting instructions. Pablo dispatched five of the ten to Bogot� for operations there, and he was planning to take two of the men to Cartagena with him. He didn&#x2019;t need more. He was an expert marksman, and he preferred traveling in smaller groups. Raul listened while Pablo gave the men instructions, nodded, and silently approved as he relit his cigar. He didn&#x2019;t offer his cigars to the others, only to Pablo when they were alone, as a mark of the brotherhood they shared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Half an hour later, five of the men were gone. Three were staying at the camp, with another dozen peppered through the jungle, part of the protection of the camp. Pablo and El Lobo exchanged a few last words then, and Raul nodded as Pablo left with the two men he wanted with him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;See you tonight,&#x201d; Pablo said over his shoulder. Pablo always reported in when he got back, to let Raul know how things had gone. They had a vast communication network that functioned efficiently, but Raul and Pablo communicated by phone and e-mail as little as possible, and both preferred it that way. They met in person before and after Pablo&#x2019;s missions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pablo trudged silently through the fierce brush of the jungle for half an hour, until they reached a heavily concealed Jeep. Pablo got behind the wheel, as the two men took away its protective covering, and then they both got in. They drove along a barely serviceable dirt track for a while, and eventually joined a battered narrow road, and stayed on it for half an hour, until they reached a clearing with a narrow airstrip that was barely more than a dirt track but was just long enough for the small plane that landed ten minutes later. Pablo had radioed for it before he left the camp, and it would make it possible for them to cover the thousand miles to Cartagena and return by that night. None of the three men spoke on the flight, and Pablo didn&#x2019;t say a word to them until they reached the landing strip they used regularly on the outskirts of Cartagena. Pablo was a man of few words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was thinking about their various operations being carried out that day, shipments coming in to several cities, others waiting to be moved. They picked up a car at the airstrip that was parked for them there, and drove to a warehouse just outside the city, and from there to a small battered building, which housed their office. It looked completely innocuous, and no one would have suspected the millions of dollars of business being conducted there. Pablo parked the car behind a neighboring house, with chickens wandering through the yard, and walked into the first building through a back door. One of Pablo&#x2019;s men stayed at the back door, the other moved to the front door. All three of them were armed. And Pablo walked up the creaking stairs to meet three men waiting for him there. He met with them for just under an hour, delivered all of Raul&#x2019;s instructions, and ascertained that the plan was clear and that they were ready to carry it out. The cocaine was being shipped, concealed in farm equipment, to North Africa, which worked well for them. And the shipment to Europe was being sent with textiles going into Marseilles. It had all been successfully done before without a problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Less than an hour later, Pablo was back on the road, to the airstrip, and in the air minutes after they arrived. The mission had gone well. When they reached the camp that night, they carefully concealed the Jeep where it had been before. Raul was waiting for him. Pablo assured him that all had gone according to plan. They handled all their shipping through Cartagena. Raul told him he needed him to go to Bogot� the next day, which was standard procedure for Pablo. He went to one of the cities where they did business almost every day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you eat?&#x201d; El Lobo asked him with concern. One of the men had bought sandwiches on the way to the airstrip outside Cartagena. They had other things to occupy them than to worry about meals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We ate.&#x201d; Pablo smiled at him, touched by the fraternal gesture. When they were alone, Raul treated him like a younger brother. And with that, he poured a glass of brandy, pushed it toward him, and offered him a cigar, which this time Pablo accepted. Raul was pleased with how things had gone. He knew he could always count on Pablo to execute his orders to perfection. He had earned the brandy and cigar and El Lobo&#x2019;s praise.</p></p><h2>Tough Minded Faith for Tender Hearted People</h2><p>BA17G0343-2 Beautiful Burgundy Book with Gold Trim &amp; Lettering Excellent Pick Me Up or Gift</p><p>366 motivational messages that make every year a leap year--A leap from self-doubt to self-fulfillment!

He heard music everywhere, especially in his own head, and he wrote down what he heard. Sebastian married, raised a family, and wrote more than a thousand pieces of music. He also created a little book of music especially for his wife, Anna Magdalena, so that in the evenings the whole family could make music together. Hundreds of years after his death, Bach&#x2019;s music is heard and played all over the world. Many people think it is some of the most glorious music ever written. And today young students--like Bach&#x2019;s own children--can learn to play the music from Anna Magdalena&#x2019;s notebook.<br></p><p><p>JEANETTE WINTER has written and illustrated many books for children, including MAMA, The Librarian of Basra, Calavera Abecedario: A Day of the Dead Alphabet Book, My Name Is Georgia, and Josefina. She lives in New York City.</p>Gr. 2^-4, younger for reading aloud. Like Winter's biography of Georgia O'Keeffe, <i>My Name is Georgia </i>(a <i>Booklist</i> Editors' Choice 1998), this simple picture-book biography of the master composer expresses the harmony of the artist's work as well as the intensity of his life. Winter begins in folktale style ("In the days of castles and kings"), with the musical gift being passed down through generations ("All the Bachs played music"); and the storytelling fits perfectly with her signature folk-art paintings. We see Sebastian's sadness when he is orphaned at age nine, and then his youthful joy in playing the organ; but the main focus is on his work as a composer, the music he hears in his head that comes to life all around him. Even in the happy family turmoil with his 20 children, even in the jail cell where he spends a month, even on his deathbed, Bach is still composing. Winter's spare poetic text is beautiful ("He heard one melody for the violin, one for the trumpet, one for the flute, and one for the oboe. Each instrument had its own voice. And when all the voices sounded at the same time, it was like good friends talking together"). In brilliant colors, with lots of blue and purple, the framed acrylic quiltlike paintings have depth and clear detail, showing the composer at work and individual instruments working together to make the waves of music that weave through everyday life and through space and time. A fine biography to use with children who play an instrument and those who love to listen. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Extinction (Forgotten Realms: R.A.

In late January 1998, after a miserable stretch of fishing that hadn't paid for even their groceries, the five-man crew of a seventy-nine-year-old Alaska schooner called the <em>La Conte</em> risked one last run to the Fairweather Grounds, despite the approach of bad weather. The young skipper, a father-to-be, was convinced fish could be found on the shoals, and his instincts were right: they hit the mother lode. For eighteen hours their lines had a fish on every hook: yellow eye, lingcod, calico, halibut, even the occasional sand shark; it was an incredible haul, one that would bring huge profits -- and respect -- back in port.</p><p>But they stayed out too long, and a hurricane-force Arctic storm caught them. Though in need of repair herself, the <em>La Conte</em> had weathered bad seas before -- and might have again. But in the cruelest of ironies, the additional burden of its magnificent catch sank the ship, and set the five men -- Bob Doyle, Mike DeCapua, Gig Mork, David Hanlon, and Mark Morley -- afloat in frigid seventy-foot seas. Their radio beacon was sending distress signals to the Coast Guard, but the chances of rescue under such conditions seemed remote.</p><p>Eight months later, on a deserted island nearly 800 miles away, two boys found a mutilated corpse that had washed ashore and been mauled by brown bears. A forensics investigator, haunted by the thought that this man's family might never know what had become of him, and with only a single partial fingerprint and scraps of a survival suit for clues, set out to identify the body.</p><p>Author Todd Lewan's painstaking investigation into these events began here, too, with the discovery that the man found dead on Shuyak Island had been one of the fishermen aboard the <em>La Conte</em>. Lewan became obsessed with learning what had become of the other crewmen; with understanding how five "end of the roaders" from different parts of the United States had come together in Alaska to fish one of the world's most treacherous patches of ocean in the dead of winter; and with conveying the way in which that "dream catch" represented an opportunity for each of the men to significantly alter his life. In the process he learned of the truly heroic efforts undertaken by no fewer than three different teams of Coast Guard helicopter rescue units to save these desperate men.</p><p>Lewan's re-creation of the events themselves -- the discovery of a lost fisherman's remains; the bonding of troubled men on the high seas; the horrifying hours spent fighting to keep from freezing to death in thirty-eight-degree water; the impossibly courageous efforts of the helicopter rescue crews; and the moving account of how one of the survivors, in particular, found during this tempest an unexpected inner strength that allowed him to turn his life around -- makes for an unforgettable tale, a page-turning narrative drama of the first order. It also provides a timeless, affecting portrait of hard-living seekers drawn to Alaska: of adventurers in search of roots, home, and the chance to remake themselves in the spirit of America's last frontier.</p></p><p><p>Todd Lewan joined the Associated Press as a correspondent in 1988. In 1996 he became an editor on AP's international desk, and later a national features writer. In 1998 he received several feature-writing prizes for this story.</p>Associated Press reporter Lewan offers a taut retelling of the 1998 story of five fishermen whose aging boat sank during an angry storm off the coast of Alaska, and of the predictably nail-biting Coast Guard rescue mission that followed. He capably explores the backgrounds and motivations of not only the small group of deckhands and their green skipper but also of their rescuers via helicopter, recreating believable dialogue and vividly evoking life on the harsh Alaskan coastline. He admirably resists the natural urge to overplay (toward the heroic) the fishermen's actions and unflinchingly looks at their alcoholism, marital discord and epic bouts of bad luck. They're not ennobled by their struggles, but rather simply challenged, changed and, in some cases, broken. But while Lewan focuses on the internal difficulties the men faced on their journey, he skimps on a detailed explanation of the role that overfishing played in the crew's decision to search out distant, more dangerous waters in their attempts to bring home a profitable-enough catch. Nonetheless, the book's flowing style and measured pacing succeed in making a familiar tale (fishermen go out, boat sinks, some don't make it) new and immediate, and in giving readers a sense of why the five fishermen were willing to risk so much for potentially so little. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The former fitness director for the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Orton now personally oversees the training of dozens of athletes, from recreational racers to elite ultramarathoners.<p></p><p><b>You In Glorious Jackson Hole </b></p><p>Okay. enough about me and the near past.</p><p>This is about you and your near future. You, the athlete&#x2014;and I use that word with full consideration and intent. Because wherever you are in your running life, you can make the choice to be an athlete. You can adopt that mind-set and make it your own defining essence. Being an athlete is not something you&#x2019;re &#x201c;born with.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a misconception, a myth, really, that is all too often also an impediment&#x2014;or, even worse, an excuse. Being an athlete <i>is</i> a choice. And making that choice, taking up that mind-set, is the step that allows you to move toward a new level of achievement. That&#x2019;s what this book is about. And that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to ask of you.</p><p>The truth is, athleticism is awareness. That simple phrase is at the core of my program. When I say, &#x201c;Athleticism is awareness,&#x201d; what I mean is that to be an athlete means you are someone who is aware of your form and technique; aware of how you move your body; aware of your effort level, of your breathing pattern; aware of what you eat (and don&#x2019;t eat); and, most important, aware of what you think (and don&#x2019;t think).</p><p>We will go deeper into that idea later, but first we need to address the physical side of things. I believe firmly that the mind follows the body. And when the mind follows a good body, it gets to the right place. So that is where we will begin the journey&#x2014;your journey&#x2014;to the Cool Impossible.</p><p>To get started, I am going to ask you to look at things maybe a little differently than you&#x2019;ve looked at them in the past. I&#x2019;m going to introduce you to some new ideas and concepts and ask you to do some new things that will help to catapult your running to another level and help you get everything that you want out of every mile. Along the way, I am going to challenge you to go above and beyond what you think is possible for yourself, for your running, and, I hope, even your life.</p><p>And to be clear, this process, this challenge&#x2014;this opportunity&#x2014;is open to every runner. This book is for you whether you&#x2019;re a beginner, or a veteran hoping to reclaim that beginner&#x2019;s enthusiasm and sense of possibility; whether you&#x2019;re a dedicated competitor, gearing your efforts to improvements in time and placings at key races, or a recreational runner, excited about the social aspects of the sport; whether you&#x2019;re someone whose running has been interrupted or compromised by chronic injury, or an enthusiastic experimenter inspired by visions of barefoot running, the Tarahumara Indians, and other adventures. This commitment to awareness will&#x2014;like Frost&#x2019;s choice between two roads diverging in a wood&#x2014;make all the difference.</p><p>One element of what you will learn later is how important and powerful a role visualization plays in performance. The mind follows the body and, in turn, performance follows the mind. But harnessing that sequence, controlling it and making it work for us to carry us to where we want to go, is a challenge&#x2014;and one that often goes unrecognized. We have lost touch with the art of daydreaming. I don&#x2019;t mean the kind of daydreaming that comes after a few hours of surfing vacation Web sites or buying that lottery ticket. We&#x2019;re all pretty good at that. No, I mean the kind of daydreaming that can help guide our performance and prepare us for the journey to the Cool Impossible.</p><p>So let&#x2019;s give it a try. Let&#x2019;s do it. Right now. Rather than simply telling you what&#x2019;s going to come in the chapters ahead&#x2014;laying out the programs and the protocols, explaining the mechanics, the physiology and the psychology&#x2014;I&#x2019;m going to give you a chance to live it. I wake up each day in Jackson thrilled anew to find myself in what is truly a running and adventure-sport paradise, living the kind of life that I once could only imagine. But that&#x2019;s the point: I <i>did</i> imagine it, and now it&#x2019;s as real as the vast, jagged face of the Teton Range that beckons me each time I step out of my house, or the bear that ambles across the trail ahead of me on my morning run, or the lung-searing challenge of an uphill sprint at nine thousand feet. I want to make it just as real for you.</p><p>I want you to imagine that you are on your way to visit me in Jackson Hole for an intense seven-day running camp. This one-on-one camp will be like no other running you&#x2019;ve ever done and will introduce you to and immerse you in every element of my training program. Jackson Hole is the real deal, the true Wild West. It&#x2019;s here that you can find your own frontier and be shocked into a new reality. I am hoping this is what you expect from your visit and from this book, because it is what I want for you.</p><br><br><p>So, here you are. . . . It&#x2019;s been a short flight from Denver or Salt Lake City (or wherever you made your connection, because, face it, unless you&#x2019;ve got a private jet you&#x2019;re not flying direct to Jackson). But it is a leap into another realm. The plane drops down out of the clouds and suddenly there it all is, a landscape so sweeping and majestic that it makes you almost laugh as you press your face to the little square of the window: the mountains, saw edged and brilliantly snowcapped, marching out to the horizon; the Snake River running its sinuous course through the valleys; the burnished tans and greens of the headlands. We are most certainly not in Kansas (in real or metaphorical terms) anymore.</p><p>You can see immediately why they call it Jackson <i>Hole</i>. The floor of the valley sits at sixty-five hundred feet, but the Tetons on the western side soar like a wall to thirteen thousand feet, and the Gros Ventre Range to the east tops out near twelve thousand feet. Trappers and hunters who found their way to the region in the early nineteenth century must have felt they were literally going over the edge as they climbed down the steep canyons into the vast encircled expanse. It still feels that way today, as the plane drops down, far below the peaks, and settles in for a landing at Jackson Hole Airport, which, with its low-slung rustic design, seems to blend in with the flat expanse of the valley.</p><p>No Jetway here. You grab your bag, running shoes dangling from the handle, and exit the plane directly onto the tarmac. You take a deep breath. The air is exhilarating and the sky astoundingly wide and close. As you follow the concrete path toward the terminal, you turn to look at the mountains, and it&#x2019;s like they&#x2019;re right there in your face. Your eye traces the wild, zigzag lines of the peaks&#x2014;dominated by the central massif, the truly majestic Grand Teton&#x2014;and follows the canyons cutting up in deep, dark Vs between the rises. You try to imagine running there, following a trail up to the Teton Crest. It seems like another world. Another you, perhaps.</p><p>Welcome to Jackson: That sort of spectacular vista, with its promise and its challenge, is everywhere here. It is also the reason why you&#x2019;re here. In the next few days you&#x2019;re going to get a firsthand taste of all that Jackson has to offer, and at the same time an introduction to my running program, a taste of what I&#x2019;ll be asking you to do, and a glimpse of where these new elements and new ways of thinking can take you&#x2014;in your running and in your life.</p><p>We meet outside the airport. I&#x2019;m the shaved-headed, skinny guy with rounded shoulders and a cheery smile. I&#x2019;m happy to see you, after all. I bundle you into my truck and off we go, windows down.</p><p>On the ride into town from the airport we pass buffalo&#x2014;yep, they&#x2019;re roaming&#x2014;beside the road, as well as an elk framed against the sky above a ridge, the same ridge on which we&#x2019;ll put in some quality miles in the days to come. We also pass a trio of cyclists, pulling big gears as they roll down the shoulder not that much slower than we&#x2019;re driving. You&#x2019;ll learn that it&#x2019;s impossible to go for long in Jackson Hole without seeing someone in motion: biking, running, hiking, paddling on the streams, skiing the trails in winter. The most adventure sports&#x2013; happy town in America&#x2014;Chris had it right.</p><p>But on this first night, before we move into action, there&#x2019;s time to sit and talk, to get a sense of where you&#x2019;re coming from, and where we&#x2019;re going to be going in the course of the next seven days&#x2014;and beyond. Over a steak salad or grilled trout at the Snake River Brewery, we&#x2019;ll talk about a lot of things. About Jackson, and the history of the valley. About the Wild West. About skiing at lunchtime and about what twenty-below really feels like. About crazy real-estate prices and about mountain lions. Behind it all, of course, will be that sense of anticipation, of an adventure about to be embarked upon. Maybe you&#x2019;re a little tired or fried from the travel, but you&#x2019;re feeling a buzz, too, that tingle that every runner knows that precedes a big test. And so we&#x2019;ll start talking about the aspects of your upcoming training. Since I&#x2019;m a bottom-up kind of guy, we&#x2019;ll start with your feet.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t worry, we&#x2019;re not going all Barefoot Ted here. My Copper Canyon race companion, and one of the pioneers of barefoot running, has a lot of wisdom to share, but I consider shoeless running a tool&#x2014;something that can help build strength and improve form for all runners&#x2014;rather than as an objective in and of itself, or even, as some would have it, a lifestyle. Remember, the Tarahumara sport those huaraches, not bare feet, across their rocky trails. For now, we&#x2019;re going to concentrate on strengthening the feet, and it&#x2019;s crucial that you can feel&#x2014;really <i>feel</i>&#x2014;what we&#x2019;re doing.</p><p>Take your shoes off. It&#x2019;s okay&#x2014;we&#x2019;re in Jackson here; you won&#x2019;t be the first at this establishment. Now look down at those feet, maybe a little pale below the sock line, the toes spreading and gripping the tile floor. For all the usual focus on leg strength, flexibility, and core fitness, when it comes to running, everything springs, quite literally, from those two kind of funny-looking appendages. Just as a race car, no matter how big an engine it has or how sophisticated a suspension, depends on four small patches of tire on asphalt to get around a track, a runner&#x2019;s performance and health are rooted in the actions of the foot, with its twenty-six bones, thirty-three joints, and more than a hundred muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Having strong feet promotes proper muscle usage all the way up the leg and throughout the core, ultimately creating the muscle equilibrium that is so important to successful running, and that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll be working on throughout your training.</p><p>Maybe you&#x2019;re imagining a gym full of machines and clanking iron; maybe you sneaked a peek down at your biceps last time you raised your glass, or you&#x2019;re trying to remember how much you hoisted the last time you did heavy leg squats. But strength training is not about how much you can lift. That&#x2019;s not the challenge. The challenge is to have an open mind about what the objective is. Strength training is about muscle equilibrium&#x2014;about making sure that the big, prime-mover muscles in the body don&#x2019;t overwhelm the smaller supporting muscles, pulling the entire system out of balance and compromising efficiency. It&#x2019;s more important how well we move and how efficient we are in using our strength than how much weight we can toss around.</p><p>And the amazing thing is that this muscle equilibrium, this <i>athletic</i> strength, will help you to run better. It will also prevent the all too familiar aches and pains and stiffness that can sometimes seem like the unavoidable price of running.</p><p>Let me be very clear about this: These aches, these pains, they are avoidable. You may have been conditioned to think otherwise, but over the course of our time together, I will show you different. With strength, muscle equilibrium, good form, and a proper training program, we can eliminate those common running ailments, have more fun, and achieve tremendous performance enhancements.</p><p>Easy, now; I don&#x2019;t want to overwhelm you. Let&#x2019;s pay the check, take a walk down Town Square. It&#x2019;s not Times Square, New York City, but what we lack in glittering lights, we make up for in quiet charm and a backdrop that takes the breath away.</p><p>I want to know some more about you. If you&#x2019;re shy, don&#x2019;t be. This is important. Before I begin coaching any athlete, I like to get a detailed sense of where he is in his running career. We runners love to talk running. It&#x2019;s our currency of exchange, as natural as putting one foot in front of the other. So let&#x2019;s talk about past races, the good ones and the ones that kicked our butts. Let&#x2019;s talk about workouts and recent long runs; tell me about your favorite route and how fast you&#x2019;ve covered it recently. And in the process I&#x2019;ll get a sense of your experience level and where you are in your training. And I&#x2019;ll ask you&#x2014;just as you no doubt are asking yourself&#x2014;what your goals are. What do you want out of your running&#x2014;from the season ahead, in terms of a specific race or training goal, to a lifetime ahead on the road or trails? If you are not a racer, we can discuss how races can personally empower you and foster a sense of adventure in your running.</p><p>Okay, that&#x2019;s a lot of talk and very little action. It&#x2019;d be nice to grab a beer together&#x2014;or, if that&#x2019;s not your thing, a coffee or tea. But this first night, it shouldn&#x2019;t be a late one. We&#x2019;ve got a whole week ahead of us, and it&#x2019;s time to turn in. I&#x2019;ll file away what I&#x2019;ve gleaned about your running past and your goals for the future.</p><p>Back at your hotel, you settle in to sleep, your window open to the cool mountain air and all that awaits outside on the trails of Jackson.</p><br><br><p>An hour after sunrise, the steep slopes of the Tetons are sharply etched in soaring lines of light and shadow, and the rolling foothills are rising into burnished greens and gold. We meet at the Cache Creek Canyon trailhead. A popular hiking, biking, and cross-country trail that runs along Cache Creek close to downtown Jackson, this will be an ideal setting for a short shakeout run. This is not a workout. It&#x2019;s just to get the blood flowing, an easy, roly-poly outing in the woods, a chance for you to get acclimated to the altitude and for me to watch you run.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll go for thirty-five to forty minutes, whatever feels comfortable. I&#x2019;ll keep the instructions intentionally vague at the beginning&#x2014; nothing more complicated or nuanced than, &#x201c;Take it easy&#x201d;&#x2014;since the important thing is to get a sense of how you naturally run. I&#x2019;ll be watching your form, and to do that I&#x2019;ll move around on the trail, leading for a while and then dropping back to follow. I might speed up the pace for a stretch and then slow it back down. I&#x2019;ll be looking to see how you respond: Do you push to keep up&#x2014;despite those instructions at the start to keep it easy? Or do you do your own thing? I&#x2019;ll be looking to see how confident you are in your own pace.</p><p>You can learn a vast amount about people just by going on an easy run with them. Every step reveals a wealth of detail, and I&#x2019;m making notes in my head as we go along: <i>Hey, her pace is good, or Hmm, his stride crosses over; He&#x2019;s not using his glutes; or She&#x2019;s a heel striker.</i> All of this gives me a road map for going forward.</p><p>I&#x2019;m an expert at running and talking&#x2014;comes with the job. So let me cover a little about form as we go. Like I told Chris, there&#x2019;s a right and a wrong way to run, and I&#x2019;m here to teach you the difference. The specifics will come later. For now, let&#x2019;s address the signifi...</p></p><h2>Big Book of Garden Designs (Big Book of)</h2><p>Presents more than 120 innovative garden plans designed to suit virtually every possible landscape condition and size, accompanied by detailed planting lists, ideas for theme gardens, plant selection tips based on climate conditions, tips and advice from a professional garden designer, maintenance and cultivation instructions, and more.

Lady Georgiana Spencer was the great-great-great-great-aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales, and was nearly as famous in her day. In 1774, at the age of seventeen, Georgiana achieved immediate celebrity by marrying one of England's richest and most influential aristocrats, the Duke of Devonshire. Launched into a world of wealth and power, she quickly became the queen of fashionable society, adored by the Prince of Wales, a dear friend of Marie-Antoinette, and leader of the most important salon of her time. Not content with the role of society hostess, she used her connections to enter politics, eventually becoming more influential than most of the men who held office. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her good works and social exploits made her loved by the multitudes, but Georgiana's public success, like Diana's, concealed a personal life that was fraught with suffering. The Duke of Devonshire was unimpressed by his wife's legendary charms, preferring instead those of her closest friend, a woman with whom Georgiana herself was rumored to be on intimate terms. For over twenty years, the three lived together in a jealous and uneasy m�nage � trois, during which time both women bore the Duke's children--as well as those of other men.<br><br>Foreman's descriptions of Georgiana's uncontrollable gambling, all- night drinking, drug taking, and love affairs with the leading politicians of the day give us&nbsp;&nbsp;fascinating insight into the lives of the British aristocracy in the era of the madness of King George III, the American and French revolutions, and the defeat of Napoleon. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gifted young historian whom critics are already likening to Antonia Fraser, Amanda Foreman draws on a wealth of fresh research and writes colorfully and penetratingly about the fascinating Georgiana, whose struggle against her own weaknesses, whose great beauty and flamboyance, and whose determination to play a part in the&nbsp;&nbsp; affairs of the world make her a vibrant, astonishingly contemporary figure.<br></p><p>Georgiana Spencer was, in a sense, an 18th-century It Girl. She came from one of England's richest and most landed families (the late Princess Diana was a Spencer too) and married into another. She was beautiful, sensitive, and extravagant--drugs, drink, high-profile love affairs, and even gambling counted among her favorite leisure-time activities. Nonetheless, she quickly moved from a world dominated by social parties to one focused on political parties. The duchess was an intimate of ministers and princes, and she canvassed assiduously for the Whig cause, most famously in the Westminster election of 1784. By turns she was caricatured and fawned on by the press, and she provided the inspiration for the character of Lady Teazle in Richard Sheridan's famous play <i>The School for Scandal</i>. But her weaknesses marked the last part of her life. By 1784, for one, Georgiana owed "many, many, many thousands," and her creditors dogged her until her death. <p> Biographer Amanda Foreman describes astutely the mess that surrounded the personal relationships of the aristocratic subculture (Georgiana and the duke engaged for many years in a m�nage � trois with Lady Elizabeth Fraser, who inveigled her way into the duke's bed and the duchess's heart). Foreman is, by her own admission, a little in love with her subject, which can lead to occasional lapses of perspective, but generally it adds zest to a narrative built on, rather than burdened by, scholarship, that is at once accessible and learned. An impressive debut, in every sense. <i>--David Vincent, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br>"Georgiana bursts from the pages of Amanda Foreman's dazzling biography like the force of nature she undoubtedly was--passionate, political, addicted to gambling, and drunk on life. This is a stunning book about an astonishing woman."<p>---Simon Schama<br><br>"A most impressive d�but. I predict a great future for Amanda Foreman. She is a scholar who matches her learning to a sense of adventure and writes with engaging vitality." ---Michael Holroyd<br><br>"A mesmerizing read. . . . The charm of Amanda Foreman's Georgiana is that it gives you all the fascinating detail you want . . . and is at the same time a serious, scholarly work, based on exhaustive archival research." <br> --Antonia Fraser, <i>Literary Review</i><br><br>"Stunning historical research plus feminine acuity yield a vivid portrait of a shrewd, seductive ancestor of Princess Diana's in an age before democracy or contraception." ---Brenda Maddox, author of Yeats' <i>Ghosts</i> and <br><i>Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom</i><br><br>"I put this book down entranced by the woman. This is an outstanding d�but by a young biographer fully in control of her sources, and with an easy, elegant writing style. She tells a tale that calls not only for our admiration but for our compassion." --Roy Strong, <i>London Sunday Times</i><br><br>"This is an accomplished and well-written biography, remarkably mature for a first effort; diligently researched and entertainingly presented.

All around us, animals are going about their lives, eating, mating, organizing and playing. Even a city part has signs of animal life, if you look closely. <p>It's easy to think of ourselves as the center of all this life, particularly if you live in a city, but man is really part of a network of life on earth. Like all networks, each piece helps to hold together the whole. But we are the one animal with the power and intelligence to protect this sacred circle of life. </p><p>Reading the Wild, with Bev Doolittle's famously detailed watercolor paintings, gives us clues, from both Indian lore and modern science, to understanding the animal life around us. With a little knowledge and a willingness to pay attention, a walk through the woods, or even a single tree, can become a scavenger hunt for the signs and the wonders of animal life. </p><p>From a tiny frog that lives above the treeline in the Sierra Nevada, to the great grizzly bear who was associated with healing and medicine by many Native Peoples, Reading the Wild will fill you with wonder and from there it's just a small step to respect for, a preservation of, our wilderness.</p>Grizzly! <p>Native Americans knew a great deal about bears. Many tribes associated bears with healing. Perhaps this was because bears ate the roots and leaves of the plants Indians used for soothing aches and pains, and for helping wounds heal. The Lakota called these healing herbs bear medicine. In the language of the Zuni Pueblo, the word for doctor is the same as the word for bear. Whenever a Zuni Pueblo doctor went to help a sick person, he wore a string of bear claws around his neck. He would ask the spirit of the bear for help in curing illness and healing wounds. The Blackfeet Indian's name for grizzly bear translates to real bear, which grizzlies certainly are. </p><p>Bears do look and act like people, more that most large animals. They can stand on their hind legs and walk upright. When they sit, they hold their front legs up like arms. Bears are omnivores, so they eat what people eat - not just grass or only meat but vegetables and fruit, nuts, salad greens, mushrooms, and berries. They even go fishing!</p></p><h2>The Cruellest Month</h2><p><p>"Many mystery buffs have credited Louise Penny with the revival of the type of traditional murder mystery made famous by Agatha Christie. . . .

Using her techniques, and the dozens of close-up photographs and diagrams, it's remarkably easy to create spectacular textures, patterns, and effects in just a few simple steps. See what happens when a stitch is worked in different threads, and learn how to change the scale of a stitch, combine stitches to make new ones, and alter the angle of the stitch. And it's amazing how much is covered: seeding, Japanese darning, a variety of stem stitches, buttonholes and variations, the twisted fly, herringbone, cable chain, zigzag coral, Portuguese border, detached loop, and many, many more. It will enhance any embroiderer's stitching repertoire.<br></p><p>During her lifetime, Constance Howard was single-handedly responsible for bringing embroidery into the world of art and fashion. In 1948 she established the department of Embroidery in the Art School at Goldsmith&#39;s College, London. From running a part-time course, she became principal lecturer in charge of textiles and fashion - with embroidery as a main subject for Diploma in Art and Design. This course would later become the BA Honours degree course. Constance Howard was a member of the British Craft Centre, of the Society of Designer Craftsmen, the Embroiderers&#39; Guild and the Art Workers&#39; Guild, as well as of the World Crafts Council. Her work has been exhibited widely in Great Britain as well as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA where she has held many workshops. In recognition of her services to art education, Constance Howard was awarded the MBE in 1975.</p><h2>U.S. Army Ranger Handbook</h2><p>Modernizing the outdoor, survival industry with it&#39;s innovative products, Pro force equipment is the choice of all levels of outdoorsman.</p><p>The</p><h2>Steamboat in a Cornfield</h2><p>A rhyming text describes an incident on the Ohio River in 1910 in which the steamboat Virginia went aground in a cornfield.</p><p>Grade 3 Up Country singer John Hartford's book tells of a true incident in the life of an Ohio River steamboat, c. 1910. The boat, the Virginia , was subject to the rather fickle nature of the river at that time and ended up beached in a cornfield. The story is told with some background about the river in the days before locks and dams existed to help regulate it. Readers, through Hartford's ballad-like poem, learn about the hard times faced by this particular steamboat company which pressured the captain to make an ill-advised venture. Through the use of old photos and maps, readers can see the steamboat both inside and out and trace its route. The accomplishment of what was seemingly an impossible taskto refloat the steamboatis documented and reveals a fair amount of suspense. At the end of the book there is a coda that fills in what happened to the principal players in the story. This unusual book will have appeal for those with a passion for steamboats, and, with its non-intimidating format and sparse text, it may win over other young history buffs. All in all, an interesting look at a heretofore unrecorded incident in the history of our country.

Until recently scientists dis�missed these stories&#x2014;waves that high would seem to violate the laws of physics. But in the past few decades, as a startling number of ships vanished and new evidence has emerged, oceanographers realized something scary was brewing in the planet&#x2019;s waters. They found their proof in February 2000, when a British research vessel was trapped in a vortex of impossibly mammoth waves in the North Sea&#x2014;including several that approached 100 feet.<br><br>As scientists scramble to understand this phenomenon, others view the giant waves as the ultimate challenge. These are extreme surfers who fly around the world trying to ride the ocean&#x2019;s most destructive monsters. The pioneer of extreme surfing is the legendary Laird Hamilton, who, with a group of friends in Hawaii, figured out how to board suicidally large waves of 70 and 80 feet. Casey follows this unique tribe of peo�ple as they seek to conquer the holy grail of their sport, a 100�-foot wave.<br><br>In this mesmerizing account, the exploits of Hamilton and his fellow surfers are juxtaposed against scientists&#x2019; urgent efforts to understand the destructive powers of waves&#x2014;from the tsunami that wiped out 250,000 people in the Pacific in 2004 to the 1,740-foot-wave that recently leveled part of the Alaskan coast.<br><br>Like Jon Krakauer&#x2019;s <i>Into Thin Air, The Wave </i>brilliantly portrays human beings confronting nature at its most ferocious.</p><p><b>SUSAN CASEY, </b>the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Teeth</i>, is the&nbsp; Editor-in-Chief of <i>O, the Oprah Magazine</i>, and has also served as creative director of <i>Outside </i>magazine.<b>57.5� N, 12.7� W</b><br><b>175 MILES OFF THE COAST OF SCOTLAND</b><br><b>FEBRUARY 8, 2000</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The &nbsp;clock read midnight when the hundred-foot wave hit the ship, rising from the North Atlantic out of the darkness. Among the ocean&#x2019;s terrors a wave this size was the most feared and the least understood, more myth than reality&#x2014;or so people had thought. This giant was certainly real. As the RRS <i>Discovery </i>plunged down into the wave &#x2019;s deep trough, it heeled twenty-eight degrees to port, rolled thirty degrees back to starboard, then recovered to face the incom- ing seas. What chance did they have, the forty-seven scientists and crew aboard this research cruise gone horribly wrong? A series of storms had trapped them in the black void east of Rockall, a volcanic island nick- named Waveland for the nastiness of its surrounding waters. More than a thousand wrecked ships lay on the seafloor below.<br>&nbsp;<br>Captain Keith Avery steered his vessel directly into the onslaught, just as he &#x2019;d been doing for the past five days. While weather like this was common in the cranky North Atlantic, these giant waves were unlike anything he &#x2019;d encountered in his thirty years of experience. And worse, they kept rearing up from different directions. Flanking all sides of the<br>295-foot ship, the crew kept a constant watch to make sure they weren&#x2019;t about to be sucker punched by a wave that was sneaking up from behind, or from the sides. No one wanted to be out here right now, but Avery<br><br>knew their only hope was to remain where they were, with their bow pointed into the waves. Turning around was too risky; if one of these waves caught <i>Discovery </i>broadside, &nbsp;there would be long odds on survival. It takes thirty tons per square meter of force to dent a ship. A breaking hundred-foot wave packs one hundred tons of force per square meter and can tear a ship in half. Above all, Avery had to position <i>Discovery </i>so that it rode over these crests and wasn&#x2019;t crushed beneath them.<br>&nbsp;<br>He stood barefoot at the helm, the only way he could maintain trac- tion after a refrigerator toppled over, splashing out a slick of milk, juice, and broken glass (no time to clean it up&#x2014;the waves just kept coming). Up on the bridge everything was amplified, all the night noises and motions, the slamming and the crashing, the elevator-shaft plunges into the troughs, the frantic wind, the swaying and groaning of the ship; and now, as the waves suddenly grew even bigger and meaner and steeper, Avery heard a loud bang coming&nbsp; from <i>Discovery</i>&#x2019;s foredeck. &nbsp;He squinted in the dark to see that the fifty-man lifeboat had partially ripped from its two-inch-thick steel cleats and was pounding against the hull.<br>&nbsp;<br>Below deck, computers and furniture had been smashed into pieces. The scientists huddled in their cabins nursing bruises, black eyes, and broken ribs. Attempts at rest were pointless. They heard the noises too; they rode the free falls and the sickening barrel rolls; and they worried about the fact that a six-foot-long window next to their lab had already shattered from the twisting. &nbsp;<i>Discovery </i>was almost forty years old, and recently she &#x2019;d undergone major surgery. The ship had been cut in half, lengthened by thirty-three feet, and then welded back together. Would the joints hold? No one really knew. No one had ever been in conditions like these.<br>&nbsp;<br>One of the two chief scientists, Penny Holliday, watched as a chair skidded out from under her desk, swung into the air, and crashed onto her bunk. Holliday, fine boned, porcelain-doll pretty, and as tough as any man on board the ship, had sent an e-mail to her boyfriend, Craig Harris, earlier in the day. <i>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t funny anymore,&#x201d; </i>she wrote. &nbsp;<i>&#x201c;The ocean just looks completely out of control.&#x201d; </i>So much white spray was whipping off the waves that she had the strange impression of being in a blizzard. This was Waveland all right, an otherworldly place of constant motion that took you nowhere but up and down; where there was no sleep, no comfort, no connection to land, and where human eyes and stomachs struggled to adapt, and failed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ten days ago <i>Discovery </i>had left port in Southampton, England, on what Holliday had hoped would be a typical three-week trip to Iceland and back (punctuated by a little seasickness perhaps, but nothing major). Along the way they&#x2019;d stop and sample the water for salinity, temperature, oxygen, and other nutrients. From these tests the scientists would draw a picture of what was happening out there, how the ocean&#x2019;s basic character- istics were shifting, and why.<br>&nbsp;<br>These are not small questions on a planet that is 71 percent covered in salt water. As the Earth&#x2019;s climate changes&#x2014;as the inner atmosphere becomes warmer, as the winds increase, as the oceans heat up&#x2014;what does all this mean for us? Trouble, most likely, and Holliday and her colleagues were in the business of finding out how much and what kind. It was deeply frustrating for them to be lashed to their bunks rather than out on the deck lowering their instruments. No one was thinking about Iceland anymore.<br>&nbsp;<br>The trip was far from a loss, however. During the endless trains of massive waves, <i>Discovery </i>itself was collecting data that would lead to a chilling revelation. The ship was ringed with instruments; everything that happened out there was being precisely measured, the sea&#x2019;s fury captured in tight graphs and unassailable numbers. Months later, long after Avery had returned everyone safely to the Southampton docks, when Holliday began to analyze these figures, she would discover that the waves they had experienced were the largest ever scientifically recorded in the open ocean. The significant wave height, an average of the largest 33 percent of the waves, was sixty-one feet, with frequent spikes far beyond that. At the same time, none of the state-of-the-art weather forecasts and wave models&#x2014;the information upon which all ships, oil rigs, fisheries, and passenger boats rely&#x2014;had predicted these behemoths. In other words, under this particular set of weather conditions, waves this size should not have existed. And yet they did.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>History is full of eyewitness accounts of giant waves, monsters in the hundred-foot range and beyond, but until very recently scientists dis- missed them. The problem was this: according to the basic physics of ocean waves, the conditions that would produce a hundred-footer were so far beyond rare as to virtually never happen. Anyone who claimed to have seen one, therefore, was engaging in nautical tall tales or outright lies.<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, it was hard to discount a report from the polar hero Ernest Shackleton, hardly the type for hysterical exaggeration. On his crossing from Antarctica to South Georgia Island in April 1916, Shackleton noticed odd movements in the night sky. &#x201c;A moment later, I realized that what I had seen was not a rift in the clouds, but the white crest of an enor- mous wave,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;During 26 years experience of the ocean in all its moods I had not encountered a wave so gigantic. It was a mighty upheaval of the ocean, a thing quite apart from the big white-capped seas that had been our tireless enemies for many days.&#x201d; When the wave hit his ship, Shackleton and his crew were &#x201c;flung forward like a cork,&#x201d; and the boat flooded. Fast bailing and major luck were all that saved them from capsizing. &#x201c;Earnestly&nbsp; we hoped that never again would we encounter such a wave.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The men on the 850-foot cargo ship <i>M�nchen </i>would have seconded that, if any of them had survived their rendezvous with a similar wave on December 12, 1978. Considered unsinkable, the <i>M�nchen </i>was a cutting- edge craft, the flagship of the German &nbsp;Merchant Navy. At 3:25 a.m. frag- ments of a Morse code Mayday, emanating from 450 miles north of the Azores, signaled that the vessel had suffered grave damage from a wave. But even after 110 ships and 13 aircraft were deployed&#x2014;the &nbsp;most com- prehensive search in the history of shipping&#x2014;the ship and its twenty- seven crew were never seen again. A haunting clue was left behind: searchers found one of the <i>M�nchen</i>&#x2019;s lifeboats, usually stowed sixty-five feet above the water, floating empty. Its twisted metal fittings indicated that it had been torn away. &#x201c;Something extraordinary&#x201d; had destroyed the ship, concluded the official report.<br>&nbsp;<br>The <i>M�nchen</i>&#x2019;s disappearance&nbsp;&nbsp; points to the main problem with proving the existence of a giant wave: if you run into that kind of night- mare, it &#x2019;s likely to be the last one you&#x2019;ll have. The force of waves is hard to overstate. An eighteen-inch wave can topple a wall built to withstand 125-mile-per-hour winds, for instance, and coastal advisories are issued for even five-foot-tall surf, which regularly kills people caught in the wrong places. The number of people who have witnessed a hundred-foot wave at close range and made it back home to describe the experience is a very small one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even if a ship does manage to survive a hundred-foot wall of water, there are no underwhelmed survivors. Big fish tales are human nature. Add to that a dose of mortal terror, honest confusion, a fear of being blamed for damage to the ship&#x2014;if, say, the wave didn&#x2019;t quite measure up to the &#x201c;something extraordinary&#x201d; test but managed to poleax the vessel anyway because the captain was below deck playing darts and drinking vodka at the time&#x2014;and what you&#x2019;ve got is less than the scientifically immaculate truth.<br>&nbsp;<br>But there was a rare occasion in 1933, when a sharp-eyed naval offi- cer aboard the 478-foot oil carrier USS <i>Ramapo </i>happened to be up on the bridge as an astonishing wave lurched out of the Pacific and his response, rather than screaming and covering his eyes, was to make a trigonometric calculation using the ship&#x2019;s dimensions relative to the wave &#x2019;s crest and trough. The result was a height estimate that, if not on par with the exac- titude of the <i>Discovery</i>&#x2019;s sensors, was at least defensible. And the officer&#x2019;s measurement? The wave was 112 feet high.<br>&nbsp;<br>If a 112-foot wave isn&#x2019;t freakish enough, consider that this one had leaped out of 45-foot seas. Thus it was more than twice the average size of anything else in the <i>Ramapo</i>&#x2019;s path, which matches the scientific defi- nition for a freak (or rogue) wave. For centuries mariners had spoken of the &#x201c;hole in the ocean,&#x201d; a cavernous trough at the base of an abnormally large wave, and the &#x201c;three sisters,&#x201d; a series of freaks in rapid succession. To scientists this kind of folklore was a hard sell. The numbers didn&#x2019;t add up. Maybe, just maybe, a once-in-an-aeon wave triple the size of its sur- rounding seas might exist&#x2014;but there was no way traditional oceanogra- phy could accept this as a typical occurrence. As for the notion of mutant walls of water showing up in sets, that was not even worth discussing. Then something happened that no one could ignore.<br>&nbsp;<br>On January &nbsp;1, 1995, the North &nbsp;Sea was feisty due to a pair of storms, a brutish one crawling northward and a smaller one moving southward to meet it. Statoil&#x2019;s Draupner oil-drilling platform sat somewhere between them, about one hundred miles off the tip of Norway. For the crew who lived on the rig it was a New Year&#x2019;s Day of thirty-eight-foot seas rolling by, as measured by the laser wave recorder on the platform&#x2019;s underside. Unpleasant, perhaps, but not especially dramatic&#x2014;until three o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, when an eighty-five-foot wave came careening over the horizon and walloped the rig at forty-five miles per hour. While the Draupner sustained only moderate damage, the proof was there. This wasn&#x2019;t a case of laser malfunction or too many aquavit toasts the night before. It was the first confirmed measurement of a freak wave, more than twice as tall and steep as its neighbors, a teetering maniac ripping across the North Sea.<br>&nbsp;<br>They were out there all right. You could call them whatever you wanted&#x2014;rogues, freaks, giants&#x2014;but the bottom line was that no one had accounted for them. The engineers who&#x2019;d built the Draupner rig had cal- culated that once every ten thousand years the North Sea might throw them a sixty-four-foot curveball in thirty-eight-foot&nbsp; seas. That would be the maximum. Eighty-five-foot waves were not part of the equation, not in this universe anyway. But the rules had changed. Now scientists had a set of numbers that pointed to an unsettling truth: some of these waves make their own rules. Suddenly the emphasis shifted from explaining why giant waves couldn&#x2019;t simply leap out of the ocean to figuring out how it was that they did.<br>&nbsp;<br>This was a matter of much brow sweat for the oil industry, which would prefer that its multimillion-dollar rigs not be swept away. It had happened before. In 1982 the Ocean Ranger, a 400-foot-long, 337-foot- high oil platform located 170 miles off the coast of Newfoundland, was struck by an outsize wave in heavy weather. We &#x2019;ll never know how big the wave was exactly, for there were no survivors. Approved for &#x201c;unre- stricted ocean operations,&#x201d; built to withstand 110-foot seas and 115-mile- per-hour winds, considered &#x201c;indestructible&#x201d; by its engineers, the Ocean Ranger had capsized and sank close to instantly, killing all eighty-four people on board.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the nautical world things were even more troubling. Across the global seas ships were meeting these waves, from megaton vessels like the <i>M�nchen</i>&#x2014;oceangoing freighters and tankers and bulk carriers&#x2014;down to recreational sailboats. At best, the encounters resulted in damage; at worst, the boat vanished, taking all hands with it. &#x201c;Two large ships sink every week on average [worldwide], but the cause is never studied to the same detail as an air crash. It simply gets put down to &#x2018;bad weather,&#x2019; &#x201d; said Dr. Wolfgang Rosenthal, senior scientist for the MaxWave Project, a con- sortium of European scientists that convened in 2000 to investigate the disappearing ships.<br>&nbsp;<br>While Rosenthal&#x2019;s numbers may be high, his point is well taken. Given the lack of survivors or evidence, exact statistics of ships scuttled by giant waves are impossible to come by; but it is clear that every year, on average, more than two dozen large ships sink or otherwise go miss- ing, taking their crews along with them. (If you also consider smaller ves- sels, the numbers are vastly higher.) In particular, a type of ship known as a bulk carrier is vulnerable: &nbsp;on one infamous occasion in March 1973, two<br>bulk carriers were lost within an hour of each other in the same area of the North Atlantic.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I first read about the missing ships, I was astonished. In the high-tech marine world of radar, EPIRB, GPS, and satellite surveillance, how could hundreds of enormous vessels just get swallowed up by the sea? And furthermore, how could this be happening without much media notice? Imagine the headlines if even a single 747 slipped off the map with all its passengers and was never heard from again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Clearly, there <i>was </i>something extraordinary &nbsp;going on out there. After the Draupner incident, it became undeniable: no one really had a clue as to how waves behaved in their most extreme forms. Yet...</p><h2>Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling With D.H. Lawrence</h2><p><br>Geoff Dyer had always wanted to write a book about D. H. Lawrence. He wanted, in fact, to write his "Lawrence book." The problem was, he had no idea what his "Lawrence book" would be, though he was determined to write a "sober academic study." Luckily for the reader, he failed miserably.Out of Sheer Rage is a harrowing, comic, and grand act of literary deferral. At times a furious repudiation of the act of writing itself, this is not so much a book about Lawrence as a book about writing a book about Lawrence. As Lawrence wrote about his own study of Thomas Hardy, "It will be about anything but Thomas Hardy, I am afraid-queer stuff-but not bad."<br><br></p><p><i>Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling with D.H. Lawrence</i> is the best book about not writing a book about D.H Lawrence ever written. Other people have written untraditional, even loopy tributes to the priest of love before--including boon companions Anais Nin and Henry Miller--but no one has done it with Dyer's chutzpah, or with such fantastic success.<p> Dyer started out with the intention of writing either a sober academic study of Lawrence or a novel based on his subject's life but couldn't seem to do either. The academic study, he realized, was really just an excuse to read Lawrence's work, and the novel never even acquired a rudimentary shape in his mind. Instead, he somehow convinced his publisher to pick up the tab for his lengthy globetrotting pilgrimage, which took him from Paris to Rome to Greece to Oxford--not to mention such Lawrentian hotspots as Taos and Mexico and San Francisco. The result is an extended, often hilarious, meditation on seafood, English TV, Dyer's own creative impulses, and occasionally even Lawrence.</p><p> In Lawrence's seminal prose he finds some justification for his own capricious indulgences: "What Lawrence's life demonstrates so powerfully is that it actually takes a daily effort to be free.... There are intervals of repose but there will never come a state of definitive rest where you can give up because you have turned freedom into a permanent condition. Freedom is always precarious." Yet he refuses to read Lawrence's novels, confining himself to letters, travel reportage, and other casuals. Indeed, "[o]ne gets so weary watching authors' sensations and thoughts get novelised, set into the concrete of fiction, that perhaps it is best to avoid the novel as a medium of expression."</p><p> Dyer's fascination with Lawrence's minorabilia suggests not only an oblique criticism of the contemporary novel, but a promising direction for the memoir. Perhaps clean, well-lighted subjectivity is a dead end, and the future lies with eccentric, provisional works along the lines of <i>Flaubert's Parrot</i> and <i>How Proust Can Change Your Life</i>--or <i>Out of Sheer Rage</i>. After all, Dyer's bright (and brilliantly shambolic) book of life reminds us of why we read in the first place: to see the surprising ways one person can be brought to life by another. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><b>'The funniest book I have ever read' Steve Martin</b></p><h2>The Ghoul Next Door: A Ghost Hunter Mystery</h2><p>On a well-deserved hiatus from the ghoulish grind of their TV show, <i>Ghoul Getters</i>, psychic medium M.

She is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Ghost Hunter Mystery series, including <i>What a Ghoul Wants</i>, <i>Ghoul Interrupted</i>, and <i>Ghouls, Ghouls, Ghouls</i>, as well as the Psychic Eye Mystery series.<b>Chapter 1</b><p>Being a psychic medium definitely has its downers. As a group, we&#x2019;re a pretty haunted lot. (Yes, I went there. . . .) Many, if not most, of us had troubled childhoods that caused us to develop a sixth sense in order to cope. And I&#x2019;m no exception. My mother died on an autumn morn�ing when I was eleven, and in his subsequent grief, my father turned to the bottle and his work. In many ways I lost both parents that day.</p><p>It took years, but Daddy finally let go of the grip he had on his daily half gallon of vodka and sought help. He&#x2019;s been sober for about sixteen years now, but the re�sidual damage to our relationship remains. During my teenage years we fought constantly. In fact, I spent most of my junior and senior years of high school at my best friend Gilley Gillespie&#x2019;s house, being looked after by Gil&#x2019;s wonderful mother, who&#x2019;d been treating me like one of her own from the moment my own mama passed away.</p><p>Things didn&#x2019;t improve even after high school when Gil and I moved from Valdosta, Georgia, to Boston.</p><p>Daddy and I just couldn&#x2019;t seem to make peace even with those twelve hundred miles separating us. And every visit back to Valdosta thereafter was torture for me&#x2014;?�usually ending with an early flight home to Boston. Re�cently, however, that&#x2019;s changed, and I can safely say that these days we&#x2019;ve never gotten along better. Although that could be because we haven&#x2019;t spoken to each other since I started showcasing my talents on TV.</p><p>Daddy was willing to tolerate my rather, as he put it, &#x201c;disturbing&#x201d; ability to talk to the dead as long as I didn&#x2019;t make a public spectacle of myself. Nearly two years ago I&#x2019;d done a cable special on haunted objects, and since then I&#x2019;ve landed a nice contract working on my own ghostbusting cable TV series, called <i>Ghoul Getters</i>. News of my success on the airwaves spread like wildfire in Val�dosta, fueled no doubt by Mrs. Gillespie, who&#x2019;s crazy proud of both Gilley and me. The consequences, however, are that now the only acknowledgments I get from Daddy are a Christmas present (picked out by his secretary) and a birthday card (also picked out by his secretary) with a check inside (probably forged by his secretary).</p><p>And as I brought the mail inside my office in Boston, so happy to be home again after a grueling four-�month filming schedule, my mood dampened the moment I saw the return address on a small package mixed in with the bills and ads.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I guess my birthday <i>is</i> next week,&#x201d; I said with a sigh, passing through the inner lobby of the little office space I rent out on Mass Avenue, about three blocks away from my condo. After setting the other mail aside, I searched my desk for a pair of scissors.</p><p>&#x201c;Come &#x2019;ere!&#x201d; I heard a squeaky voice cry.</p><p>&#x201c;In a sec, baby,&#x201d; I replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Come &#x2019;ere!&#x201d; the voice insisted.</p><p>I ignored the command and fished around the drawer, finally coming up with the scissors, and began to care�fully cut through the package.</p><p>&#x201c;Come &#x2019;ere! Come &#x2019;ere! <i>Come &#x2019;ere!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>I share my office (and my condo, and my life) with a feathered, red-�tailed African gray parrot named Doc&#x2014;?�whom I&#x2019;ve had since fifth grade. He&#x2019;s adorably sweet, funny, and maybe a teensy bit demanding. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m busy, honey,&#x201d; I told him.</p><p>Doc climbed along the bars to exit the little door of his cage and make it up to the roof&#x2014;?�which houses a nice play stand, and where he could perch and have a better view of what I was fiddling with. &#x201c;What do you do?&#x201d; he asked. Doc speaks better English than most toddlers.</p><p>&#x201c;Opening a package.&#x201d; At this point I got the thing opened and managed to pull out a square black box with gold lettering on top, which indicated it&#x2019;d come from one of the finer jewelry stores in Valdosta&#x2014;?�my hometown. Lifting the lid, I sucked in a breath when I took notice of an absolutely beautiful gold charm bracelet with three charms&#x2014;?�a golden parrot, a small happy ghost, and a heart. For a moment I just stared at the gift, completely taken by surprise. &#x201c;What&#x2019;re you up to?&#x201d; Doc called, try�ing to get my attention again.</p><p>I realized I had my back to him, so I turned and lifted the beautiful bracelet up for him to see. He cocked his head curiously.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; I asked him.</p><p>Doc blew me a really good raspberry.</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s a critic,&#x201d; I laughed. But I went back to staring at the charm with a mixture of bewilderment and delight, while Doc added to the raspberry a long litany of clucks, whistles, and happy chirps.</p><p>Doc&#x2019;s been with me since right after Mama died. My</p><p>paternal grandmother had given him to me after my mother&#x2019;s passing to help bring me out of the terrible grief I was silently suffering.</p><p>The baby parrot was like a beacon of light in a world filled only with heartbreak. My mother had been the kindest, most wonderful and loving person I&#x2019;d ever known, and her loss devastated me right into muteness. I spoke not one word for many months after her funeral. Even when I fell and broke a finger, I cried silently, un�able to free my vocal cords from the crushing weight of my grief. Doc changed all that. Like a phoenix he pulled me from the ashes, and slowly, with his help and love of mimicry, I healed and started talking again. But the chatty, charming bird seemed to have no effect on Daddy. And I&#x2019;ll never understand why, but right from the start Daddy had seemed to resent my delightful pet. In fact, he&#x2019;d tol�erated Doc a lot like he&#x2019;d tolerated my ability to talk to dead people . . . ?as in he&#x2019;d barely tolerated him at all.</p><p>So, opening Daddy&#x2019;s gift to reveal something so lovely and thoughtful as a parrot charm and a ghost charm was a real surprise. And the heart was also an out-�of-�character choice from Daddy. He just wasn&#x2019;t sentimental or out�wardly emotive. He was more like a closed door that I&#x2019;d long since given up knocking on.</p><p>For a second I thought that it simply must have been his secretary&#x2019;s choice, but she&#x2019;d never shown one shred of sensitivity for me. Previous gifts were simplistic items, like a pair of candlesticks, or a paperweight, or a picture frame. I&#x2019;d long thought of Daddy&#x2019;s secretary of twenty years, Willamina, as a harsh, cold woman who preferred dressing all in black except for the bloodred lipstick she coated her thin lips with.</p><p>Her style made her look as if she were perpetually in mourning, and given how my mother&#x2019;s death had turned</p><p>Daddy into such a terribly cold and bitter person, I found some irony in that.</p><p>At last I tore my eyes away from the charm and fished around inside the envelope it&#x2019;d come in, finding a card there too. I opened it to read a lovely handwritten note in beautiful cursive, wishing me the happiest of birthdays and hoping to catch up soon. The handwriting wasn&#x2019;t anyone&#x2019;s I recognized, but the signature was clearly Daddy&#x2019;s. And not the forged signature of his secretary, but Daddy&#x2019;s real scraggly scrawl, which added even more mystery to the gift.</p><p>I moved to my desk and sat down, because I needed to sit down. Slipping the bracelet on, I stared at it and won�dered first what was going on with Daddy, and second, how should I respond to such a lovely, thoughtful gift?</p><p>The average normal person would&#x2019;ve immediately picked up the phone to call and thank her father for the kindness, but as you may have guessed, I&#x2019;m not exactly normal. There were too many years of missed opportu�nities, broken promises, harsh words, and judgmental attitudes to be swept aside by a bit of precious metal.</p><p>Still, after taking off the bracelet to set it gently back inside the box, I did reach for the phone. &#x201c;Sweet baby Jesus, gurl! Why&#x2019;re you calling me so early?&#x201d; Gilley an�swered by way of greeting.</p><p>&#x201c;I got a birthday package from Daddy,&#x201d; I said, getting right to the point.</p><p>Gilley yawned, and I could imagine him bleary-�eyed and mop-�headed, tangled in his bedcovers. &#x201c;Let me guess: This year&#x2019;s check is for two hundred, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s not a check.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His secretary just sent a card? Jeez, M.J., why does that man even bother anymore? I&#x2019;ll call Ma. She&#x2019;ll make sure you get a nice present on your birthday.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled. Mrs. Gillespie had been making sure I re�ceived lovely gifts on my birthday for twenty-�two years now, and she never needed prompting from her son, ei�ther. &#x201c;No, Gil, you don&#x2019;t understand. Daddy sent me a really nice gift.&#x201d;</p><p>That won me another yawn. &#x201c;Black leather gloves?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A solid gold charm bracelet with three charms: a par�rot, a heart, and a little Casper ghost.&#x201d;</p><p>Gilley was silent for about five seconds. &#x201c;Is your dad sick?&#x201d;</p><p>I leaned back in my chair and threw an arm over my eyes. &#x201c;I have no idea. We haven&#x2019;t spoken in almost a year and a half.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Leave it to me,&#x201d; Gil said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call Ma and get the scoop.&#x201d; Mrs. Gillespie was tied to all the gossip in our hometown.</p><p>I hung up with Gilley but kept my arm over my eyes. What if Daddy <i>was</i> sick? What if he was <i>really</i> sick? I knew that with my abilities I could probably find out the answer, but I was too chicken. There was a part of me that didn&#x2019;t want to know, because I&#x2019;d already lived through one parent&#x2019;s terminal illness, and it&#x2019;d nearly been my undoing.</p><p>Doc began singing a Village People song and I knew he was trying to coax me out of the distressed state I was in, but my mind was going in circles and I couldn&#x2019;t pay attention to him at the moment. Instead I turned my chair around, propped my feet up on the windowsill, and went back to laying my arm over my eyes. After working for much of the last year in the middle of the night, I find that I think better in the dark.</p><p>&#x201c;M.J.? Are you all right?&#x201d; a voice asked several min�utes later.</p><p>With Doc&#x2019;s singing and my whirling mind I hadn&#x2019;t heard the front door open. What&#x2019;s more, as I stiffened</p><p>and sat up in the chair, I realized I recognized that voice. The day suddenly went from disconcerting to crazy weird. Turning slowly to the front, I took in the tall, dark, and incredibly handsome man standing in my doorway and had to work hard to appear calm and nonchalant. &#x201c;Hello, Steven,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What brings you by?&#x201d;</p><p>My ex-�boyfriend smiled in that way that&#x2019;d always made my heart quicken . . . ?okay . . . ?still makes my heart quicken. Also, the bastard had the gall to smell really good too. &#x201c;How&#x2019;ve you been?&#x201d; he asked, his voice deep and rich, like a great cup of coffee.</p><p>I felt my head bobbing. &#x201c;Good . . . ?good. You?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a bit of an awkward pause and then the door opened again and in walked my current boyfriend, Heath&#x2014;?�who also happens to be rather tall, dark, and seriously hunky.</p><p>Things went from awkward and weird to<i> Are you kid�ding me, universe?</i></p><p>Heath said nothing; he simply came in wearing a smile, took one look at Steven, darted his eyes to me, back to Steven, then back to me as if to say, <i>&#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d;</i></p><p>I pretended not to notice. Oh, and I also held in the urge to run out of there as fast as my feet could carry me. &#x201c;Steven, you remember Heath. Heath&#x2014;?�Steven. �Steven&#x2014;?�Heath.&#x201d;</p><p>The two surveyed each other with narrowed eyes and forced smiles. I had a moment to compare the two of them side by side and it occurred to me that as similar as they are in the basics of black hair, dark eyes, and tall stature, they&#x2019;re still strikingly different. Steven&#x2019;s shoul�ders are broad and his chest is very defined, while his legs are very long. His face is also distinctly European in structure with a wide brow and square features, while</p><p>Heath&#x2019;s face is very angled with high cheekbones and deep-�set eyes. His frame is also more proportional and corded with lean muscle. In other words, neither was the kind of guy you&#x2019;d kick out of bed for eating crackers . . . ?at least not until after you&#x2019;d had your way with him.</p><p>While the men stared each other down, I cleared my throat and shuffled a few things around on my desk, and that&#x2019;s when Heath must&#x2019;ve noticed the charm bracelet I&#x2019;d set back in the box. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; he demanded, pointing to the box on my desk. &#x201c;You giving her presents now, Sable?&#x201d;</p><p>Steven&#x2019;s brow furrowed. &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d;</p><p>Hastily I put the top of the box back on to cover the gift. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s from my father, Heath,&#x201d; I explained quickly.</p><p>&#x201c;For your birthday,&#x201d; Steven said with a knowing nod. &#x201c;That was nice of him.&#x201d;</p><p>I noticed Heath paled a little. &#x201c;Today&#x2019;s your birth�day?&#x201d; he blurted out; then his face flushed red. &#x201c;I mean, yeah, totally. Happy birthday, honey! I came to take you to a birthday breakfast!&#x201d; Glancing back at Steven, he said, &#x201c;My gift&#x2019;s in the car.&#x201d;</p><p>Steven smiled (a bit evilly, I thought). &#x201c;Her birthday is next week, Whitefeather. The eleventh. Might want to mark that down on your calendar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What brings you by, Steven?&#x201d; I nearly screeched, desperate to change the topic before this came to blows, and judging by the furious expression on Heath&#x2019;s face&#x2014;?�we weren&#x2019;t far from that.</p><p>Steven and Heath glared at each other for a few more seconds before my ex turned back to me and said, &#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A haunting.&#x201d;</p><p>That took me by surprise . . . ?much like the entire morn�ing. I waved at a chair and he came forward and took the</p><p>seat directly across from me. Heath grabbed the other chair and brought it around the desk to park it right next to mine. I held in a sigh, hoping there&#x2019;d be no suggestion from either of them of lowered zippers and a measuring tape before the conversation was at an end. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; I asked, pulling a pad forward to write on.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a where,&#x201d; Steven said, and for the first time I could see that his eyes were lined with worry. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a who.&#x201d;</p><p>I blinked. &#x201c;Who what?&#x201d; (I may have been a little off my game from all the testosterone fumes.)</p><p>Steven shifted in his seat, and I suddenly noticed how nervous he was. Coming to me hadn&#x2019;t been something he&#x2019;d done on a whim. He&#x2019;d had to talk himself into it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a place that&#x2019;s haunted. It&#x2019;s a person. My fian�c�e&#x2019;s brother. We think he&#x2019;s possessed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your <i>fianc�e</i>?&#x201d; I gasped at the same time that Heath said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s possessed?&#x201d;</p><p>Heath turned narrowed eyes on me while the corners of Steven&#x2019;s mouth quirked, and that rather big ego that&#x2019;d been a part of the reason I&#x2019;d left him came shining to life again. &#x201c;Yes. To both of you,&#x201d; he said. (But I thought he looked a bit smugly at me.)</p><p>&#x201c;Well . . . ?er . . . ,&#x201d; I sputtered, doodling large circles on the notepad while I tried to collect myself. (He was get�ting married? We&#x2019;d only been broken up for a few months! What the hell?) &#x201c;Congratulations!&#x201d; I said. Per�haps a bit too enthusiastically.</p><p>&#x201c;Why do you think this guy&#x2019;s possessed?&#x201d; Heath asked.</p><p>Steven sighed and rubbed the stubble on his chin. &#x201c;You have to see it to believe it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m telling you, there is a ghost haunting this young man. My fian�c�e, Courtney, can tell you about it better than me. I&#x2019;d like to introduce you if you&#x2019;re interested in taking on the case.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Possession isn&#x2019;t exactly our area of expertise,&#x201d; I said. No <i>way</i> was I getting involved in this. (Okay, so really, no <i>way</i> was I meeting his fianc�e!)</p><p>&#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to meet her and talk about it,&#x201d; Heath said, never once turning his face away from Ste�ven. &#x201c;Is Courtney nearby?&#x201d;</p><p>I felt my posture stiffen.

In 2003, she met Lale Sokolov, a meeting that changed both their lives. As their friendship grew, he entrusted her with the task of telling the world the innermost details of his life during the Holocaust.a sincere...moving attempt to speak the unspeakable * The Sunday Times * What an extraordinary and important book this is. We need as many memories of the Holocaust as we can retain, and this is a moving and ultimately uplifting story of love, loyalties and friendship amidst the horrors of war. I'm so glad Lale and Gita were eventually able to live long and happy lives together, and thankful that Heather Morris was moved to record their incredible story. It's a triumph * Jill Mansell * Extraordinary - moving, confronting and uplifting . . . a story about the extremes of human behaviour: calculated brutality alongside impulsive and selfless acts of love. I recommend it unreservedly' * Graeme Simsion, author of The Rosie Project * Based on the true story of Lale Sokolov, who is forced to tattoo numbers on his fellow concentration camp detainees' arms. * The Bookseller * Nothing that I could possibly write here would be eloquent enough to convey to you how powerful and moving this book was. I could go on for pages telling you how well this is written, nothing is overdramatized...she just tell this tale that is at its bare bones a love story. I cried entire buckets of tears. Finally I will use the words of Lale "If you wake up in the morning, it is a good day" that it is. That it is * Netgalley Reviewer * What I loved so much about this book is that it actually made me stop and think; each and every one of those people, regardless of their number or rank within the system or whether they survived or didn't, had their own story. A quite unexpected story in fact of love, despite the odds, within the concentration camps. What's so beautiful about this book is not actually that it's true. Because it is both too beautiful and too ugly to really "enjoy" reading such an honest first hand account. What struck me the most was how quickly relationships, and very strong friendships almost akin to family, develop when times are so terrible. A hard-hitting, important book with love at it's core. A brave story shared with an author who delivers it perfectly for one man, and his love affair, who would not be defeated * Netgalley Reviewer * I don't like reading war time books because they get too depressing or too political. But this one was so different, it gave you hope, that even in the darkest of times if your willpower and faith is strong you can come out successful * Book Ninja * It is one of the rarer stories of the Holocaust, that dares to feature romance in such a place of misery, hopelessness and the dearth of birdsong. Love happened, and the unlikely, nay downright impossible, happened, and this heartfelt book is a very enjoyable presentation of that. * The Bookbag * A beautifully written harrowing story of one man's will to survive in Auschwitz...it is a story of hope and endurance and a beauty that emerges when all around is painted in black. As a reader you cannot help but be affected by this account the simplicity of the story telling only adds to the poignancy... * Library Thing * This is an outstanding read...An extremely powerful and absorbing read that had me in tears at the most surprising moments and it will be making an appearance in my Top Ten of 2017. It is due to be published in January 2018 and I hand on heart urge everyone to read it. * Batty About Books * Though very hard to read in places, this story is full of hope, love, courage and kindness. It made me cry a lot, but in places it also made me smile, as it shows humanity at its best in the worst of times. Lale had nothing but positivity and determination and, along with Gita and many of the other prisoners, is one of the bravest people you will ever read about. This review doesn't come close to doing The Tattooist of Auschwitz justice. It's such a heartbreaking, beautiful story and one I'm so glad Lale got to tell * Foreword Books * The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a very moving book, showing the survival of humanity in a brutal place. I love this story * The Reading Life * Lale Sokolov's story not only moving and heart-breaking, but also humbling and inspiring hope. I was so totally blown away by this book that I am really struggling to find words for the emotions it evoked in me. In her writing, Morris manages to convey the spirit of a young man trying to survive, but also hold on to his humanity the best he can. It was heart-breaking and humbling to see the strength of the human spirit in the face of death. What an amazing man. What an amazing story. Everyone should read this unforgettable book * But Books Are Better * I don't think I've ever felt happier about a love story than now. I really admired Lale from the very start of this novel, his positivity and his determination to survive shine through from the very beginning and it was wonderful to see how he tries to give Gita hope when she sees none. Heather Morris did a brilliant job writing Lale's personal story, and even though it was a very compelling testimony and there were still many sad moments to get through, the overruling feeling after I finished it is one of warmth and contentment for these two individuals. Lale and Gita's love story was a perfect counterweight for the predominant harshness of this novel. * The Belgian Reviewer * I absolutely loved this book and thought it was a powerful and emotional story of survival in such an awful time. Lale is such a wonderful, amazing man who uses his power as the tattooist to help others, he is truly an amazing man...This story is such an emotional one that I found myself really pacing through this book, I found it so difficult to put down. It was beautiful and inspiring and I hope others pick up this book when it is released next year. I highly recommend this * Life and Tea * This was such an emotional read, so many highs of Lale and Gita and then so many lows of friends lost along the way * Lozzi Book Reviews * I've always held a deep respect for books that remind us how terribly bad human nature can be if left unbridled, so it went without question that this book was a must-read. I very much enjoyed reading this, and I envy the author for the precious hours she was able to spend with such a forgiving, peaceful human being. It would be an honor to have met Lale Sokolov * Slightly Cracked Belle * 'Lale did what had to be done to survive, but he also boosted morale and saved inestimable lives by appropriating food and medical supplies from right under the noses of the SS Death's Head Units. He was naturally empathetic, well liked by his fellow prisoners and held out to the end with his dignity and integrity unblemished. More amazingly, perhaps, is that he developed a deep and enduring love for a women he had branded upon entering the camp. The Tattooist of Auschwitz is the remarkable, percipient, utterly unforgettable novel based on Lale's experiences as camp tatowierer * Book Jotter * Even when we think we've heard enough we will never be free of the stories of the Holocaust and we shouldn't be. As long as there is ink and paper the stories need to be told because there is always one we haven't heard. The Tattooist of Auschwitz was one of those for me...we know at the outset they survive but it's in the how that keeps us riveted and shaking our heads in amazement at the courage, the determination to survive and the love these two have for each other * WeeSied * The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a very powerful and emotional read. At times it is overwhelmingly harrowing, yet at the same time there is always a hint of hope. * Little Miss No Sleep * one of the most life-affirming, courageous, unforgettable and human stories of the Holocaust: the love story of the tattooist of Auschwitz. * The Book Trail * The Tattooist of Auschwitz, is a tale that will live long in the minds of its readers.Morris weaves Lale's story into a mesmerising fictional narrative, that at times leaves the reader astonished not purely by what Lale witnesses and experiences, but the determination and resolve of this man. It is both a terrific oxymoron and a testimony of the triumph of love that the human capacity for affection and compassion can reveal itself in such an horrific setting, but it is also testament to these two individuals that they can foster love in the darkest of moments. This is a book whose story - not least because it is based on true events - couldn't fail to affect me. I longed for Lale and Gita's happiness and future, but I was also haunted by all those who didn't achieve either. For me, reading this book was a pleasure, a lesson and a reminder; I would recommend it to all readers. * Nudge Books, Bookhugger review 5/5* * I couldn't put this book down. Despite the horrors within its pages, this is also a tale of love, friendships, and hope. It's a story that made me stop and think about the individual stories of other prisoners in these camps, what they had to do to stay alive and who they lost along the way. Stories that we will never know but that we should never forget existed. This is a short novel but it packs a huge punch; the combination of Heather Morris' storytelling and Lale's unforgettable true story make this book impossible to put down. * Strupag book blog * The story broke my heart over and over, but also gave me hope. Out of something so awful, the love between Lale and Gita was born and managed to withstand and survive. It's something you need to read to believe because the tale is like something out of a movie. Of course, I gave this 5 stars. It is beautifully written and tells an incredible story that needed to be told. * Chloe Metzger * Somehow both Lale and Gita survive - this isn't a spoiler, this is a true story and so we know at the outset they survive but it's in the how that keeps us riveted and shaking our heads in amazement at the courage, the determination to survive and the love these two have for each other. I can only imagine a person could only survive if there was cunning and courage and caring involved. * Denice's Day * This is an important period in history, one that should never be forgotten or taken lightly. Heather has done a wonderful job in relating Lala's story. It is an emotional journey, and even now I still feel the emotion as I write this review, a few days after reading the book. * Me and My Books * This is not a comfortable read and nor should it be. What the Jews and other minority groups suffered at the hands of the Nazi's is something the world should never forget. The fact that this is a true story makes it all the more horrific, yet it has glimmers of hope and humour and ultimately love. * My Bookish Blogspot * Despite how much this book broke my heart, it also reassured me that things weren't all bad for all of the people stuck in concentration camps, &amp; that some were able to find happiness in small doses. * Writing Wolves * I really did appreciate it was inspired by the true events of a couple; both humbling and heartbreaking, I was captivated by their love story. I felt like this point of view was incredibly original. Lale was not just a typical prisoner of Auschwitz concentration camp- he was the tattooist. I have never read any WWII fiction with this type of perspective and I was in awe of the atrocities he experienced were explained. The lengths that Lale goes through to protect Gita were astonishing and their will to survive was fascinating. * Clues and Reviews * This is definitely a book that will stay with me for a very long time. It also needs to be shared far and wide, to be read by all ages and all peoples, so that would happened is never forgotten, so that it never happens again. * Secret Library Book Blog * Out of one of the worst periods of human history comes an inspirational story of love, hope and survival... a beacon of light amidst the dark ruins of the Holocaust.Lale's harrowing but unforgettable story is one of beauty and brutality, life and death, humanity and inhumanity, but through it all the flame of hope never dies. It is the beacon that sees him through the very worst of times and gives light to the rest of his days. An extraordinary story of an extraordinary love... * Lancashire Evening Post * The story, the tale of Lale and Gita is so memorable * Much Ado About Books * This book is unmissable. It's a readable, sensitive, morally complicated and engrossing story * Those Precious Stolen Moments * The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a story of love against all the odds. It is beautifully written, desperately sad and at the same time triumphant. A must read WW2 novel * The Welsh Librarian * Would I recommend this story? A million times yes! This is a story that not only needs to be read, but it's one that we can not afford to forget. It is moving, emotional, gritty, and most importantly, real * Minimac Reviews * A fascinating insight in the life at Auschwitz and how the main character manages to survive by having given the task of tattooing the numbers on the arms of the prisoners of Auschwitz. You probably won't keep your eyes dry with this one! I can highly recommend The Tattooist Of Auschwitz to any fan of the genre * It's All About Books * This is a debut novel by Heather Morris, it is a true account of Lale Sokolov's time in Auschwitz. It's a harrowing read of the treatment the prisoners endured. This was a brutal and chilling read but also very emotive...this was sensitively written and compelling, I sometimes had step back for a moment to remind myself that this really happened and everything I was reading was a devastating and cruel reality. This is definitely a book that I recommend you pick up in 2018... * Louise Loves Books * The fact that this is a true story makes it all the more horrific, yet it has glimmers of hope and humour and ultimately love * My Bookish Blog Spot * I really did appreciate it was inspired by the true events of a couple; both humbling and heartbreaking, I was captivated by their love story * Clues and Reviews * Despite the ugliness and the gut wrenching setting there is beauty in this book, the resilience that Lale finds deep in himself, his courage and above all his strength of character shine through, as does his love for Gita. The author has done an incredible job of retelling Lale and his Gita's story, at times I felt I was there alongside him, I felt his despair, his pain and those moments when it would have been easier to have given up than live another day. I found the end of the book very emotional as the reader learns what happened to Lale and Gita in the years after Auschwitz. This is one book that will haunt me for a long time to come, but I think it's a book everyone should read. Highly recommended * The Book Review Cafe * It is a story full of horror but of hope and the strength of human spirit in the face of adversity and Lale and Gita were such an admirable, brave couple and I'm glad I got to read their story, as many stories were unable to be told * Books And Me * It is a story full of horror but of hope and the strength of human spirit in the face of adversity and Lale and Gita were such an admirable, brave couple and I'm glad I got to read their story, as many stories were unable to be told * Bookkaz * I fell just a bit more in love with Lale the more I read. * Sissi Reads * A powerful and deeply moving story of survival and also a remarkable love story * The Last Word * The Tattooist of Auschwitz is very much a story of survival. The Tattooist of Auschwitz isn't just about how Lale met and fell in love with Gita, but also about how coura...</p><h2>Saga of the Sioux: An Adaptation from Dee Brown&#39;s Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</h2><p><p>This new adaptation of Dee Brown's multi-million copy bestseller, <i>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</i>, is filled with photographs and maps to bring alive the tragic saga of Native Americans for middle grade readers.

Here, he brings homosexuality and race together in the story of the great gospel singer Arthur Montana. Arthur was found dead in the basement of a London pub at the age of thirty-nine, yet he lies on in this memoir. Written by Hall, his brother and manager, it is in part a subtle and moving study of the treacherous ebb and flow of memory. Set against a vividly drawn background of the civil rights movement of the sixties, &#34;Just Above My Head&#34; explores how Arthur discovers his love for Jimmy - &#39;with his smile like a lantern and a voice like Saturday nights&#39; - and portrays how profoundly racial politics can shape the private business of love.</p><p>The stark grief of a brother mourning a brother opens this novel with a stunning, unforgettable experience. Here, in a monumental saga of love and rage, Baldwin goes back to Harlem, to a church of his groundbreaking novel <i>Go Tell It On The Mountain</i>, to the homosexual passion of <i>Giovanni's Room</i>, and to the political fire that enflames his nonfiction work. Here, too, the story of gospel singer Arthur Hall and his family becomes both a journey into another country of the soul and senses--and a living contemporary history of black struggle in this land.<p></p><p>"A work of passion...

BRUCE KNECHT </b>is a New York-based writer for <i>The Wall Street Journal. </i>His work has also been published in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and the <i>New York Times Magazine.</i>&#x201c;<i>Hooked</i> is a fish story, a global whodunit, a courtroom drama--and a critically important ecological message all rolled into one.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Tom Brokaw</i><br><br>&#x201c;It's one of the best ones I've read in years&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Tom Brokaw</i><br><br>&#x201c;A high-seas adventure with enough action and suspense to have you holding your breath.<br><br>A mystery that untangles the roots of a culinary fad fitfully hatched in and marketed from Los Angeles.<br>A courtroom thriller.<br><br>Proof positive that an objective eye is the most persuasive of all.<br>Mr. G. Bruce Knecht, take a bow.<br><br>Not only is "Hooked: Pirates, Poaching and the Perfect Fish" a rollicking read, it is a relief. And a wonder. For wrapped up in these red-blooded storytelling ingredients is the account of another assault on our planet's troubled environment. And let's face it, conservation writing has become one of our dreariest forms: The sky is falling, oh dear ... fill in the blanks.<br><br>In these taut pages, Knecht takes livelier aim at the plundering of a limited resource for the sake of growing appetites. He delivers us, straight ahead and close-in, to an epic sea chase across the fearsome Southern Ocean. In one boat, righteous men are out to get what they want, what they regard as theirs, in this seascape of ice and storm. In the other, righteous men are out to stop them in the name of the law.<br><br>The story about the demise of the Patagonian toothfish, an ugly, tasteless creature with an unappealing name, is not so heartening. But the fact that Knecht tells it with such crackling drive and with complete confidence in the good judgment of his readers is.<br><br>The Patagonian toothfish is large, dark-skinned and cod-like in appearance. The name comes from its undershot mouth and needle-sharp fangs. It dwells in deep, cold waters - for purposes of Knecht's story, in the waters of the far Southern Hemisphere. Back in the late 1970s, it was a trash fish caught only incidentally by the commercial fleet that worked out of Valparai&#x301;so, Chile. It was thought too oily to be desirable.<br><br>But a decline in the catch of other more salable fish, along with some desperate determination by global fish brokers who work the Chile-to-Los Angeles circuit, a dash of ingenuity by seafood marketers and a splash of savory miso glaze in a fancy New York restaurant, and voila&#x300;, you have the highly desirable, evermore expensive and, of course, deliciously trendy Chilean sea bass.<br><br>You can guess what this newfound glamour has meant for the toothfish. Late in the game, as usual, fishery experts have weighed in with the news that this long-lived, slow-growing animal cannot endure the strip-mining of modern commercial fishing. By now, though, the fish has become the rage, commanding exorbitant prices; for fisherman, this is irresistible. Although their reach and budgets are limited, governments have made efforts to "save" the toothfish, joined in the effort by environmental activists and, here and there, responsible chefs too.<br><br>But enough. I said that Knecht had confidence in his readers. This book contains no sermon. All the essential elements are there, yes. But if someone is going to take to the soapbox and wag a stern finger, it will have to be you.<br><br>Tearing through this page turner is enough to trigger a pinch-me sensation. Wait a minute, am I reading a book about exploitation of our fragile planet in which the writer isn't bashing me over the head with the obvious? Am I learning about the sensibilities of those who fish where they please along with the struggles of those who try to stop them? Am I getting both a story and the story?<br><br>You are.<br><br>We can wish Knecht good fortune in the hope that others will follow his cue. True enough, not all conservation issues yield the plot and rugged characters of a Jack London high-seas adventure. And it's plain that the most pressing conservation stories, like global warming, don't arrive at easy answers.<br><br>But there is something to the notion of casting one's net wider than the didactic, and Knecht proves it. Conservationists will be with him, and who knows who else he will reel in for the sake of an oh-my-goodness tale.<br><br>A reporter for the Wall Street Journal as well as an experienced sailor, Knecht's last book was the harrowing adventure "The Proving Ground," the story of the tragic Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race in 1998, in which a surprise storm took out more than half the fleet and killed six mariners. His feel for the wild wonder of the sea goes without saying.<br><br>But what about the courtroom thriller part of this book?<br><br>We'll leave that to the author and his compelling narrative. The outlines of the story have the Australian patrol boat Southern Supporter in territorial waters north of Antarctica, prime habitat for the shrinking population of Patagonian toothfish. The under-gunned patrol encounters a shadowy 175-foot, Uruguayan-flagged ship, the Viarsa-1. Fishing pirates? Probably.<br><br>Before the tale is over, these ships have traversed 4,000 miles of some of the most inhospitable and terrifying waters on the planet, and two years have lapsed. Australia, which is not alone among nations with an imperfect record of managing fisheries, has its laws tested by the tradition of lawlessness that has long ruled the high seas.<br><br>All the while, by the heavy ton, by the container load, by the merciless rule of supply and demand, Patagonian toothfish are drawn from the deep, grilled, poached, broiled and sauced in another maritime gold rush.<br><br>Then a jury speaks.<br><br>It gives away nothing to say that when you next find yourself at a restaurant looking at the seafood offerings, you'll know what you should do.<br><br>John Balzar is a Times staff writer and the author of <i>Yukon Alone: The World's Toughest Adventure Race.</i>&#x201d; &#x2014;John Balzar, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;In 1977 Lee Lantz, a Los Angeles fish wholesaler, came across something new in the Chilean fishing port of Valparaiso. The enormous "fearsome- looking gray-black fish" was called "bacalao de profundidad," or "cod of the deep," by the local fisherman, and nobody wanted it. In "Hooked," G. Bruce Knecht, a writer for The Wall Street Journal, tells how the fish nobody wanted became the trendy Chilean sea bass, and how over the last 30 years it has been fished almost to the point of extinction. In chapters that move from places like the South Indian Ocean to Bridgehampton, N.Y., to Vancouver to Perth, Australia, Mr. Knecht tells of the rise and fall of a fish, as well as of a 4,000-mile chase to seize a pirate fishing boat. &#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>The Penguin Book of Gay Short Stories</h2><p>These thirty-nine stories chronicle the gay experience over the course of the last century, beginning with the unarticulated longing of two boys swimming in D.H. Lawrence's "A Poem of Friendship" and ending with the explicit sexual interaction of two boys in a bathtub in A.M. Homes's "The Whiz Kids." <br> &nbsp;<br> In between there is every imaginable kind of gay story written by every imaginable kind of writer&#x2014;gay and straight, male and female&#x2014;all illuminating the common ground of the gay male experience and its astonishing diversity.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The book is like a long enjoyable party, at which the celebrated rub elbows with the neglected.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>In this provocative, wonderfully varied anthology, a formidable array of talents--gay and straight, men and women--investigate the experience of love between men, the individualistic complexity of gay male identity and gay men's relationships with lovers, friends and family. Highlights include Graham Greene's story about a newly wed but secretly gay man on a Mediterranean honeymoon with his wife, William Trevor's tale of hypocrisy at an English boys' school and works by Larry Kramer, Edmund White, Christopher Coe, Allan Gurganus, Ann Beattie, Edna O'Brien, D. H. Lawrence, Noel Coward, Sherwood Anderson and E. M. Forster. A third of the 39 selections appear here for the first time, alongside familiar pieces such as J. R. Ackerley's unsparingly candid account of his sex life and John Cheever's portrayal of love in prison from the novel Falconer . Several pieces may startle or provoke, such as Stephen Greco's raw, defiant dream-memory of the gay scene before AIDS; A. M. Holmes's graphically explicit romp involving two schoolmates in a bathtub; and James Kirkup's story of an American college teacher in Japan who goes to bed with one of his students. The tragedy of AIDS and its emotional and social impact are movingly depicted in stories by Peter Wells, Michael Cunningham, co-editor Leavitt and, one of its victims, the late Allen Barnett. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.This 39-story collection is an important addition to gay literature that encompasses nearly a century of writing. It casts aside the notions of so much pre-1980s writing that presupposed a gay ghetto where men suffered more at each other's hands than from straight oppressors' persecution, an unalterable chasm between gays and the rest of the world, and the suffocating oppression of a double, half-secret life. The stories individually often treat themes of homosexual self-identity, but the characters in them are defined not so much by their sexuality as by their relative positions in society and their shifting relationships with each other, their friends, wives, children, and families. The authors represented in this wide-ranging assemblage are not exclusively gay males and include Ann Beattie, Barbara Pym, and Edna O'Brien. More expectably present are Noel Coward, Christopher Isherwood, Larry Kramer (in a stunning tour de force of Jewish ethnicity, "Mrs. Tefillin"), Paul Bailey indulging his meditations on semen or "spunk," and A. M. Homes, who is in fact a woman able to write with astonishing authenticity from the point of view of teenage boys. <i>Whitney Scott</i></p><h2>Kitchen Princess 5</h2><p>SOMETHING&#x2019;S COOKING<br><br>Najika went to Seika Academy with a dream: to find the boy who saved her life and made her smile when everything else had gone wrong.

He was by nature an explorer and spent considerable time tramping the upper Midwest. In the summer of 1867, he and some of his students made a field trip to the headwaters and tributaries of the Green River. Intrigued with the country, he returned in 1868, wintered there, and decided to mount an expedition to explore the course and navigability of the river. On May 24, 1869, Major Powell and a small band of men launched four boats to begin what would be a 99-day expedition from known territory in Wyoming to known territory in Nevada. Between the two settlements lay some 1000 miles of what Powell called &#34;the Great Unknown.&#34; He and his men basically had to invent expedition river running. The boats, stout and heavy, were off-the-shelf navy longboats with sharp cutwaters, meant to be rowed bow-first on the sea rather than down rock-studded rivers. Powell&#39;s discovery run, fraught with excitement and tragedy, proved that the river originating in northwest Wyoming was the same river that ended in the Gulf of California, that it went through the Grand Canyon, and that it could be traveled by boat. As they came down the river they took periodic observations of latitude and longitude, elevations, and estimates of distance that allowed mapmakers to show the river&#39;s course. In 1871-1872 Powell led a second expedition over most of the same route. Several accounts of the expeditions were published in government documents and popular publications of the time and were read avidly by those who planned to try the river later.</p><p></p><h2>The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse</h2><p>A study of the art form developed by Matisse after an operation drained him of the strength to continue his oil painting, focusing on the elements of color and design that characterize his prints, paper cut-outs, and paper cut-out maquettes</p><p></p><h2>Anne Sexton: A Biography</h2><p>A biography of Anne Sexton explores the work and the tormented emotional life of the powerful American poet, a woman who struggled with mental illness throughout her career, finally taking her own life in 1974</p><p>A wonderful book, just, balanced, insightful, complex in its sympathies and in its judgment of Sexton both as a person and as a writer... a deeply moving account."-- The New York Times Book Review <p></p>"Judicious and canny.

He lives in New London, New Hampshire.With many Christmas picture books to his credit, dePaola now regales readers with 15 personal tales of Christmases past. The first chapters vividly recall family and community celebrations of the holidays, followed by memories of Christmas as a high-school and college student and as a novice at a Vermont priory. The last three selections describe Christmases as an adult celebrated in San Francisco, New York City, and New Hampshire. Brightening the pages are illustrations in varied styles and media, from an intriguing portrait of dePaola's Italian grandmother to decorative paper collages to iconic paintings of great stillness and beauty. The jacket flap calls this dePaola's "first book for all ages," and, in truth, it probably <i>will</i> appeal to adults as much as children. Written with dialogue and humor as well as reflection, the episodic stories may interest children who enjoyed dePaola's 26 Fairmont Avenue series. Teachers and librarians on the lookout for books of memoirs will want to make a note of this one. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

S. Forester was born in Cairo in 1899, where his father was stationed as a government official. He studied medicine at Guy's Hospital and, after leaving Guy's without a degree, he turned to writing as a career. His first success was Payment Deferred, a novel written at the age of twenty-four and later dramatized and filmed with Charles Laughton in the leading role. In 1932 Forester was offered a Hollywood contract, and from then until 1939 he spent thirteen weeks of every year in America. On the outbreak of war he entered the Ministry of Information and later he sailed with the Royal Navy to collect the material for The Ship. He made a voyage to the Bering Sea to gather material for a similar book on the United States Navy, and it was during this trip that he was stricken with arteriosclerosis, a disease which left him crippled.

Written between 1884 &amp; 1887, they are a significant contribution to the fields of psychology, pharmacology, and social history. <br><br> This book contains all of Freud's 'cocaine papers' plus Freud's letters, notes, dreams &amp; recollections on the subject, together with the most pertinent writings from the 19th C to the present of Freud and cocaine. <br><br>As a history of Freud's breakthroughs and failures in his personal experimentation with cocaine it offers both an intimate and human portrait of the young genius in his very first original scientific efforts and the most definitive study to date of the controversial alkaloid, cocaine. <br><br>'Cocaine Papers' includes a wealth of previously unpublished and unavailable writing both by and about Freud.

Suddenly a terrible explosion lights up the sky. Grabbing the camera, the couple flees as approaching police cars speed toward the scene. Five years later, the crash of TWA Flight 800 has been attributed to a mechanical malfunction. But for John Corey and Kate Mayfield, both members of the elite Anti-terrorist Task Force, the case is not closed. Suspecting a cover-up at the highest levels and disobeying orders, they set out to find the one piece of evidence that will prove the truth about what really happened to Flight 800 - the videotape that shows a couple making love on the beach and the last moments of the doomed airliner.<br></p><p>John Corey, former NYPD homicide detective, assigned to the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force in the pre-millennium 90's, makes a return appearance in a thoughtful novel offering an alternative to the government's "official" position on what really happened to TWA Flight 800, which crashed off the Long Island coast in the summer of 1996. Accompanying his wife Kate to a memorial marking the five-year anniversary of the crash, Corey's curiosity is aroused by what appears to be a concerted effort by Kate's fellow federal agents to keep him--and her--from investigating a case that appears to be closed. Corey's detecting skills lead him to two witnesses to the crash, who were enjoying an adulterous interlude on the beach at the time the plane went down--and videotaping their sexual escapades while what appears to be a terrorist missile attack takes place in the background. What ratchets up the tension in this capably written thriller is what the reader knows but Corey doesn't as he heads for a showdown with those responsible for the official cover-up as the clock ticks down to the morning of September 11, 2001. DeMille's deft touch with a riddle wrapped in an enigma--what really happened to Flight 800--makes his "what if" scenario a more than plausible theory; you don't have to believe in conspiracies or government cover-ups to find his latest engrossing, entertaining, and enlightening. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p> </p><p></p><p> <strong>Amazon.com Exclusive Content</strong> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> <b>Nelson DeMille on <i>Night Fall</i>: An Exclusive Essay</b> <br></p><p> It was a true story, the explosion of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island in 1996, that inspired Nelson DeMille to write the fictional <i>Night Fall</i>.

And guess what? She doesn't have a shred of dirt on anyone, including Walt Disney, Dick Clark, Fabian, Paul Anka, or even Cubbie. What else would one expect from Annette Funicello but an overly nostalgic portrait of the decade that gave rise to Disneyland, TV shows like The Mickey Mouse Club, rock 'n' roll, and teen idols? The happy story of Annette's youth in Los Angeles, Disney's discovery of her, her emergence as the biggest Mouseketeer of all, her subsequent television, movie, and recording careers, her two marriages (the second blissful, the first not that bad), her lovely children, and her heroic fight against multiple sclerosis are enough to keep anyone away from the sugar bowl for life. At the same time, Funicello's honesty and sincerity keep the whole thing from seeming untrue, no matter how much some sections beg for her to show Walt Disney in a single crabby moment, Dick Clark flying off the handle at the Drifters, or Fabian being all hands on a date with her. And she leaves to the imagination what proposed movie storylines like ``Annette the Doper, Annette the Hooker, Annette the Drunk'' might have been like. Other than her struggle with MS, though, the worst moment is Paul Anka saying something unkind to her on the telephone. But Annette (with Romanowski, who co-authored Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme) manages to avoid being precious. In fact, her account of being among the first visitors to Disneyland and a barrage of information about performing with people like Frankie Avalon make for some quite illuminating sections. And she even admits to smoking and a little drinking. By the end, Funicello is able to look back without taking any of it, especially albums like Italianette and Hawaiianette, too seriously. (Doubleday Book Club selection) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Reader beware: Annette Funicello's autobiography is so sugary your teeth will hurt after reading it. It's safe to say that if Funicello hadn't disclosed her battle with multiple sclerosis last year, there would probably be no book, since her career effectively ended in the early 1970s. Her health problems are the most affecting part of the account, especially in contrast to descriptions of the cotton-wrapped life she led before the disease struck. A squeaky-clean teen idol, protected by the Disney Studio, an ideal daughter, living at home until she married, a woman whose highest calling was motherhood--Annette personifies another era. The 1950s did exist in real life like they did on TV, and Annette is proof of it. Sometimes, however, her na{&#x2039;}ivet{&#x201a;}e is a bit hard to swallow, especially when it comes to her near adoration of Walt Disney, the man who discovered her. Throughout, in the drippiest fashion possible, she praises her mentor. Annette must not have read the recent bios that paint Walt as a fascist-leaning, alcoholic anti-Semite. This opus has all the substance of an overlong <i>People</i> magazine article, but that's not to say plenty of boomers, the intended audience, won't get a kick out of flashing back to such Mousketeer memories as Spin and Marty and Anything Can Happen Day--and, of course, the way Annette filled out her sweater. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Ragged Lake: A Frank Yakabuski Mystery</h2><p><p><b>Gruesome murders, a northern secret, and a buried past</b></p> <p>While working one afternoon on the Northern Divide, a young tree-marker makes a grisly discovery: in a squatter&#x2019;s cabin near an old mill town, a family has been murdered.</p> <p>An army vet coming off a successful turn leading a task force that took down infamous biker criminals, Detective Frank Yakabuski arrives in Ragged Lake, a nearly abandoned village, to solve the family&#x2019;s murder.

All the places included here embody a long, preindustrial heritage; they are also communities of a well-preserved beauty, widely visited by travelers from all parts of the world.<br><br>Twenty-five of the most beguiling small towns of rural and seaside England are included. Here are market towns that have traditionally owed their importance and prosperity to the agricultural land surrounding them, towns that grew up by river crossings, small ports harboring both fishing and trading fleets, centers of religious activity, and even spas.<br><br>The whole of England is represented in Palmer's delightful photography and perceptive commentaries, revealing how history, site, and the availability of local building materials have combined to shape the appearance of towns in different parts of the country. Darker stones lend a slightly forbidding yet noble air to the towns of the north, such as Barnard Castle. The eastern counties have a wealth of ancient half-timbered architecture, punctuated by buildings in flint and limestone, while to the west lie the honey-colored streets and houses of the Cotswolds.<br><br>Here, too, are towns formed by their social and cultural contexts&#x2014;the elegant Georgian and Victorian houses of Buxton, Derbyshire, reflecting its heyday as a fashionable spa; the imposing terraces in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, an expression of its importance as a market town and religious center with a magnificent abbey.<br><br>A Traveler's Guide, listing places to visit, to stay, and to eat, helps both armchair and actual travelers enjoy even more a visit to England's delightful countryside. 260 color photographs.</p><p><b>Hugh Palmer</b> is one of Britain's foremost photographers of rural life. His previous books include many titles in the <i>Most Beautiful Villages</i> series.</p><h2>The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith</h2><p>Ian Smith, former president of Rhodesia, spares few of his opponents as he gives a forthright account of one of Africa&#39;s most controversial political careers. Smith details his boyhood in Southern Rhodesia, his enlistment into the Royal Air Force and his active service during World War II. After the war, he joined the United Federal Party and initiated moves with various British Governments under Macmillian and Douglas-Home. This resulted in the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, and then Britain led the world in adopting sanctions against Rhodesia. He also tells how the British Government&#39;s poor handling of the Rhodesian situation led to unrest in the area which Henry Kissinger tried unsuccessfully to quell. Eventually the first majority elections were held, the results of which Margaret Thatcher refused to recognise, leading to the Marxist-orientated rule of President Mugabe. This autobiography deals with many political events that have been conveniently glossed over. It presents a fascinating portrait of one of the 20th century&#39;s most distinguished political figures.</p><p>Smith, the white prime minister of Rhodesia who engineered the country's unilateral independence from Britain in 1965 and led resistance to the black majority until Zimbabwe was born of post-civil war negotiations in 1979, has written an unrepentant, heavily detailed account of his leadership. He proceeds from the posture that the black majority, significantly rooted in traditional culture, should be "gradually" brought up to "standards of Western civilization." He condemns outside countries that "arrogant[ly]" applied sanctions against Rhodesia and associates black opposition more with communism than nationalism. He claims that "our black people" had the best education, health, housing, services, etc. in Africa, not acknowledging the gap between white and black Rhodesia. He refers to black "terrorists" while downplaying the cruelties of Rhodesia's armed forces. Yet Smith makes some points. He offers inside details of negotiation, including pressure from South Africa. His title refers to the hypocrisy of the British Commonwealth, which imposed sanctions on Rhodesia while many of its other members were one-party states. And he reminds us that Zimbabwe's black-run Mugabe government has steadily flouted democracy.

Hard cover, 287 pp.] [From front jacket flap] In the years between the two world wars, American sports experienced what has come to be known as its Golden Age. The extraordinary accomplishments and colorful myths of its heroes were celebrated, in those days before television, by a class of journalists as remarkable in their profession as the athletes themselves-men whose talents, authority, and appreciation of life made them the bellwether of a flourishing press. The recollections of eighteen of those surviving sportswriters, their memories both personal and professional, are set down in No Cheering in the Press Box. Dan Daniel, John Kieran, Marshall Hunt, Richards Vidmer, John R. Tunis, Shirley Povich, Jimmy Cannon, Red Smith, Paul Gallico-these were some of the notable writers of that time whose acute and pungent recall gives this hook its unique readability. And in the contributions of the lesser-known reporters, we are given penetrating views of the inner life of big-time athletics and city newspapering when both were at their zenith. With the honesty, eloquence and vitality of its contributors, and the sensitive editing of Jerome Hokzmail. No Cheering in he Press Box stands as a landmark of American oral history.</p><p></p><h2>Book of Great Cookies</h2><p>Carefully worked-out recipes promise every kind of cookie, and a few surprise delicacies, the cookie lover could wish for, providing for a great variety of drop, bar, icebox, rolled, and hand-formed confections</p><p></p><h2>The Book That Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization</h2><p><p><b>Understand where we came from.</b></p><p>Whether you're an avid student of the Bible or a skeptic of its relevance, <i>The Book That Made Your World</i> will transform your perception of its influence on virtually ever facet of Western civilization.</p><p>Indian philosopher Vishal Mangalwadi reveals the personal motivation that fueled his own study of the Bible and systematically illustrates how its precepts became the framework for societal structure throughout the last millennium.

It gets better with age.What's the oddest ingredient or meal you've ever had?A meal at a famous food writer&#x2019;s house: She served chopped liver and challah as an appetizer when half the guests had told her they didn&#x2019;t eat liver, then pork roast for a main course, but no vegetables, no potatoes, just candied apple rings, then two chocolate desserts, neither of them particularly good.

Certainly, it will no longer imply that her husband will provide for her, as an ability to earn a living is commonly expected of both men and women. Also, marriage will no longer offer a woman a unique gateway into sexual and domestic pleasures, since premarital cohabitation has long ago ceased to be a taboo. Marriage will not be a woman's indispensable passage to motherhood -- up to 40 percent of American first babies are being born out of wedlock. And, since one in two marriages will end in divorce, it will no longer guarantee a woman permanent protection in a world that has traditionally been unkind to unmarried women.</p><p>In this atmosphere of high ambiguity, it is instructive to look to the past, to see what it meant to be a wife from the earliest days of civilization to the present, and to explore how the contemporary wife came into being.</p><p>From the perspective of modern marriage, the distinguished cultural historian Marilyn Yalom charts the evolution of marriage in the judeo christian world through the centuries and shows how radical that collective change has been. For example, how did marriage, considered a religious duty in medieval Europe, become a venue for personal fulfillment in contemporary America? How did the notion of romantic love, a novelty in the Middle Ages, become a prerequisite for marriage today? And, if the original purpose of marriage was procreation, what exactly is the purpose of marriage for women now?</p><p><em>A History of the Wife</em> is a study of laws, religious practices, social customs, economic patterns, and political consciousness that have affected generations of wives: in ancient Greece, where daughters were given by fathers to husbands to create legitimate offspring; in medieval Europe, where marriage was infused with religious meaning; during the Reformation and the Age of Enlightenment, when ideals of companionate marriage came to the fore; and in twentieth century America, where a new model of spousal relationships emerged.</p><p>This rich, lucid chronicle of the turning points in a <em>History of the Wife</em> includes unforgettable stories about married women who have rebelled against the conventions of their times, from Marjorie Kempe to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, from Heloise to Margaret Sanger. Drawing extensively from diaries, memoirs, and letters, <em>A History of the Wife</em> also pays tribute to the ordinary wives who over the centuries changed with and against the currents they encountered, quietly affecting the legal, personal, and social meaning of marriage.</p><p>For any woman who is, has been, or ever will be married, this intellectually vigorous and gripping historical analysis of marriage sheds new light on an institution most people take for granted, and that may, in fact, be experiencing its most convulsive upheaval since the Reformation.</p></p><p>The cultural historian who gave us <i>A History of the Breast</i> takes stock of the wife from her conception by the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans to her 20th-century manifestation as the New Woman. Beginning with the charter myth for the Judeo-Christian wife (Adam and Eve), Marilyn Yalom explains the religious, legal, and social practices of ancient civilizations that provided the template for the idea of wife as property of and subservient to her husband, with a role limited to mother and housekeeper. What she discovers is that the recent transformation of wifehood from sexless stay-at-home dependent to sexy supermom is actually the distillation of changes that have been going on for a long time, say a couple of thousand years. In fact, what makes Yalom's passage through time so fascinating is the steady rise and fall and rise again of the status of the wife and her struggle for greater autonomy. There are plenty of surprises: the first reciprocal marriages were actually had in Roman times; divorce became popular around the same time that monogamy was instituted; and while it's true that Puritans punished adultery harshly, it was they who brought the concepts of mutual love and lovemaking (other than for procreation) to America. The growing tension between women's impulses towards emancipation and the reaction against it was a quickly repeating theme in the 20th century, best exemplified by a WWII ad of a working woman pledging to "guard every bit of Beauty that he cherishes in me." <p> The wives in this revelatory genealogy resonate with the aid of illuminating stories and the lively voices found in letters and diaries. Through these, Yalom lithely demonstrates that the fantasy of the selfless devoted wife has always had an ineluctable twin, the archetypal powerful woman--and vice versa. While college women in the 1970s may have declared that "the idea that a woman's place is in the home is nonsense," Yalom points out that society still acts like every breadwinner has a stay-at-home wife, and the anxieties that are raised in advice columns today are not that different from those a hundred years ago. Greater independence and equality have not, as feared, led to the abandonment of the marital institution, nor many of the issues that haunt it. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p><p>Marilyn Yalom is a former professor of French and a senior scholar at the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University.

Leaving behind his beloved Paris gallery, Paul Rosenberg had managed to save his family, but his paintings&#x2015;modern masterpieces by C�zanne, Monet, Sisley, and others&#x2015;were not so fortunate. As he fled, dozens of works were seized by Nazi forces and the art dealer's own legacy was eradicated.<br> More than half a century later, Anne Sinclair uncovered a box filled with letters. "Curious in spite of myself," she writes, "I plunged into these archives, in search of the story of my family. To find out who my mother's father really was . . . a man hailed as a pioneer in the world of modern art, who then became a pariah in his own country during the Second World War. I was overcome with a desire to fit together the pieces of this French story of art and war."<br> Drawing on her grandfather's intimate correspondence with Picasso, Matisse, Braque, and others, Sinclair takes us on a personal journey through the life of a legendary member of the Parisian art scene in <i>My Grandfather's Gallery</i>. Rosenberg's story is emblematic of millions of Jews, rich and poor, whose lives were indelibly altered by World War II. Sinclair's journey to reclaim her family history paints a picture of modern art on both sides of the Atlantic between the 1920s and 1950s that reframes twentieth-century art history.</p></p><p><p><b>Anne Sinclair</b> is Paul Rosenberg's granddaughter and one of France's best-known journalists. For thirteen years she was the host of <i>7 sur 7</i>, a weekly news and politics television show for which she interviewed world figures of the day, including Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Madonna. The editorial director of <i>Le Huffington Post</i> (France), Sinclair has written two bestselling books on politics.</p><p>RUE LA BO�TIE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Number 21. I&#x2019;ve passed by it hundreds of times. My mother liked to show me the 1930s fa�ade with its stone arches. I&#x2019;d noticed various shops on that street&#x2014;ice cream, pizza&#x2014;but I&#x2019;d never stopped to take a closer look. Now, seventy years after my grandfather had left the premises, I wanted to see the building for myself. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine that three years later I would unveil a plaque on this very building that I had not yet entered.</p> <p>Today it&#x2019;s an office of the Veolia Environmental Services company. I call them up: &#x201c;My grandparents used to live there. I&#x2019;d love to take a look around, really just a look. I don&#x2019;t want to disturb you&nbsp;&#x2026; It was before the war, I&#x2019;m sure there are few traces left&nbsp;&#x2026; Of course I understand if it&#x2019;s not possible.&#x201d; I detected the ambivalence in my own voice. It was almost as if I worried that they might actually let me in.</p> <p>They did. Why would they resist? So one Wednesday in April 2010 off I went to Veolia, to 21 rue La Bo�tie, where I begin my story. Touched by my curiosity and possibly a bit incredulous that it&#x2019;s taken me to the age of sixty to set foot in the building where my grandfather&#x2019;s gallery was located, my hosts graciously show me around.</p> <p>The hallway has been divided, and there are white stucco columns with Corinthian capitals, which I find a bit tasteless. Are they original? And a black-and-white damier marble floor. It&#x2019;s all been redesigned, modernized, the rooms, the spaces. There are spotlights affixed to the ceiling. The staircase with its old-fashioned banisters leading to the upper floors seems unchanged. Lots of Fernand L�ger&#x2019;s and Andr� Masson&#x2019;s paintings used to hang on the walls of this interior stairway, which led to my family&#x2019;s private apartments: the one belonging to my grandparents and their children, then the one to my great-grandmother, Paul&#x2019;s mother, Mathilde Rosenberg. Of course no paintings now hang in this stairway, which leads to various offices. The overall impression is dreary. Yet the elevator is modern, surely in compliance with health and safety regulations. The rattling old cage of another age is gone.</p> <p>The stairway within the gallery, the one with the cast-iron banister, seems to have retained its original look, from the 1930s, when my grandfather did some elaborate renovations. The floor is patterned with marble mosaics made with yellow stones. But there&#x2019;s no way of telling exactly where the mosaic plaques went, the ones designed by Georges Braque, who also supervised their installation. Above the stairs were arches, replicas of the ones outside, adorned with pieces of mirrored glass.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m in the lower of the two exhibition halls, the one that appears in so many of the photographs I&#x2019;ve seen of my grandfather situated in his domain. All the exhibitions at rue La Bo�tie were held in this large room. A month of Braque, another of Henri Matisse, a third of Pablo Picasso. It is now a boardroom for Veolia executives. The fine oak parquet floor is still there, and I immediately recognize the wood paneling, which I&#x2019;ve seen in the photographs, as well as the glass ceiling with its little star-shaped windows, which, as in other galleries of the time, diffused the light so as to soften the hard edges of cubist painting.</p> <p>If I half closed my eyes I could see them, those big paintings from the 1920s and 1930s, hanging on the walls. Soon after, those masterpieces would be replaced by portraits of the head of the Vichy government, Marshal Philippe P�tain.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>In 1927 E. T�riade, a famous critic and art publisher of Greek descent, described the Galerie Rosenberg in &#x201c;Feuilles volantes,&#x201d; the monthly supplement of the influential journal <i>Cahiers d&#x2019;art</i>: &#x201c;We are introduced into a huge room, high-ceilinged, bare walls, naked light, a room in which sober brown curtains weigh down on the collection, in which two solitary armchairs upholstered with dark velvet reach toward you like two grand inquisitors; no, they&#x2019;re not reaching toward you, they&#x2019;re going for your throat, as masterpieces do. Hurricanes of solitude, of austerity, pass through the room&nbsp;&#x2026; Paul Rosenberg: he&#x2019;s dressed in black. He has the anxious face of an ascetic or a passionate businessman.&#x201d;1</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s another description of the setting, particularly interesting when you consider that the author is the notorious, extreme-right-wing writer Maurice Sachs, who later defined himself as a Jew, a homosexual, and a collaborator before being killed by a bullet to the back of the head by the Germans in whose service he had worked: &#x201c;His grand seigneur bearing was part of his particular genius&nbsp;&#x2026; You step into Rosenberg&#x2019;s gallery as if entering a temple: the deep leather armchairs, the walls lined with red silk, would lead you to think you were in a fine museum&nbsp;&#x2026; He knew how to cast an extraordinary light on the painters he took under his wing. His knowledge of painting was deeper than that of his colleagues, and he had a very sure sense of his own taste.&#x201d;2</p> <p>Paul, who had taken over his father&#x2019;s gallery with his brother, L�once, in 1905, decided to set up on his own in 1910 and moved alone to 21 rue La Bo�tie, in the Eighth Arrondissement of Paris. Nineteenth-century works were shown on the mezzanine; contemporary art, on the ground floor. If visitors were unsure about Braque or L�ger, Paul invited them upstairs to see softer-contoured works by Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, or Auguste Rodin. He hoped they might buy some of these, which would allow him to support his unknown friends, such as Picasso or Marie Laurencin, the muse of the poet Guillaume Apollinaire. In 1913 she became the first artist to sign an exclusive deal with Paul, an arrangement that stood until 1940. She was joined by Picasso in 1918, Braque in 1923, L�ger in 1926, and Matisse in 1936.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>In 1912, almost as soon as he had moved in, Paul sent out an announcement just as anyone opening a shop might do, describing his new venture: &#x201c;I will shortly be opening new modern art galleries at 21 rue La Bo�tie, where I plan to hold periodic exhibitions by the masters of the nineteenth century and painters of our own times. In my view, however, the shortcoming of contemporary exhibitions is that they show an artist&#x2019;s work in isolation. So I intend to hold group exhibitions of decorative art&nbsp;&#x2026; Not only do I plan to offer my spaces for free, I shall not take a percentage in the event of a sale. For each exhibition I shall publish at my own expense a catalog of the paintings, sculptures, furniture, etc.&#x201d;</p> <p>The critic Pierre Nahon stresses Paul&#x2019;s desire to establish a connection between French painting of the past and the modernist trends of the twentieth century, noting that in the late 1930s Paul had on his walls and in his inventory a collection of G�ricault, Ingres, Delacroix, Courbet, C�zanne, Manet, Degas, Monet, Renoir, Gauguin, ToulouseLautrec, Picasso, Braque, L�ger, Le Douanier Rousseau, Bonnard, Laurencin, Modigliani, and Matisse. &#x201c;The gallery,&#x201d; Nahon writes, &#x201c;is becoming an essential meeting place for everyone who wants to follow the development and the work of the innovative painters.&#x201d;</p> <p>My own research is centered on an attempt to conjure the grandfather I barely knew. And to summon up the <i>riches heures</i> of the thirties and the grim ones of the forties that are integral to his story.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>My grandfather had great difficulty regaining possession of his gallery after the war. The state had confiscated the building from the collaborators in August 1944 and made it the headquarters of the Saint-Gobain construction company, before finally returning the building to my grandfather. By then it had endured the sinister events that I am about to relate, events with which my grandfather could never make peace. Paul finally sold 21 rue La Boetie in January 1953. He was determined never again to live in that place, its basement filled with propaganda from the darkest years, its rooms still haunted by the ghosts of the occupation.</p> <p>For a long time the building was home to the French General Information Service, Renseignements G�n�raux, the French police intelligence service, and the secrets of the Republic were buried with the secrets of the collaborators.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2012 by �ditions Grasset &amp; Fasquelle</p> <p>Translation copyright � 2014 by Shaun Whiteside</p></p><h2>Biscuit Storybook Collection</h2><p><p><strong>Have fun with Biscuit, in this collection of ten favorite Biscuit stories plus a sticker sheet!</strong></p><p>The sweet yellow puppy is here!

She lives in Oregon.The endearing winged cats who escaped the city to be cared for by two reliable country children (Catwings, 1988, etc.) make a third appearance in this tale of a self-important kitten from nearby who discovers that his true worth is not what he has supposed. Alexander--``the biggest, the strongest, and the loudest''--has never noticed that his sisters are ``quite tired of him,'' but when he sets out to explore the world he soon learns that his cocky preconceptions don't serve. The cow who says ``Moo'' instead of ``Mew'' is unconcerned when he corrects her; speeding trucks and rude dogs threaten; when he bolts up a tree, he can't climb down and his doting parents don't turn up to help. Enter youngest Catwing Jane, nearly mute because of an early trauma (her only words are ``Me'' and ``Hate''), to take Alexander to her home--where his parents and ``Owner'' turn out to be glad to let him stay. After Alexander cajoles and hectors Jane into confronting her fears and describing them with her first real words, the Catwings agree: Alexander is ``wonderful.'' Brief as it is, this is a deftly crafted bildungsroman. The book's small format and Schindler's delicate illustrations add to the enchantment. A first chapter book to charm both newly independent readers and their elders. (Fiction. 5-10) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His arrival in Deva (more commonly known as Chester, England) does little to improve his mood, and after a straight thirty six hour shift at the army hospital, he succumbs to a moment of weakness and rescues an injured slave girl, Tilla, from the hands of her abusive owner.</p><p>Now he has a new problem: a slave who won't talk and can't cook, and drags trouble in her wake. Before he knows it, Ruso is caught in the middle of an investigation into the deaths of prostitutes working out of the local bar. A few years earlier, after he rescued Emperor Trajan from an earthquake in Antioch, Ruso seemed headed for glory: now he's living among heathens in a vermin-infested bachelor pad and must summon all his forensic knowledge to find a killer who may be after him next. </p><p>Who are the true barbarians, the conquered or the conquerors? It's up to Ruso&#x2015;certainly the most likeable sleuth to come out of the Roman Empire&#x2015;to discover the truth. With a gift for comic timing and historic detail, Ruth Downie has conjured an ancient world as raucous and real as our own.</p><p>Published in the UK as <i>Medicus (Ruso) and the Disappearing Dancing Girls</i>.</p></p><p><p>In 2004, <b>Ruth Downie</b> won the Fay Weldon section of BBC3's End of Story competition; Medicus is her first novel. She is married with two sons and lives in Milton Keynes, England.</p><p>&#x201c;The real achievement here is the lavishly, often hilariously detailed portrayal of the world that absorbs Ruso's exhausted wits and energies (Downie even manages a few good jokes about English cuisine). And in cheerful mutual insults exchanged between Ruso and his colleague and rival Valens, we hear again the effervescent voices of M*A*S*H's Hawkeye and Trapper John. And Ruso is a wonderful character, fueled by a dyspeptic machismo and sullen charm reminiscent of Harrison Ford in his heyday. A charming novel.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;It's such a pleasure--because it's such a rare experience--to come across a completely well done piece of commercial fiction. What a pro Ruth Downie is, and this is only her first book. I don't know if she closely researched her story (set in Britain during the Roman occupation in the time of the emperor Trajan). I do know that everything about the story, its setting and its people seems compellingly real. Her protagonist, a Roman army doctor named Gaius Petreius Ruso, is likeable company. His adventures as an amateur sleuth, which begin when he autopsies a dead woman pulled from a nearby river, are drolly rendered. And his low-key romance--so low key that he's the last to realize it is a romance--with a local woman who loathes her Roman overlords is both comic and touching at once. The highest praise I can offer this wonderfully entertaining portrait of the Roman Empire at its most far-flung is that I hope Downie is planning a series.

It is as essential as spirituality and sexuality, and in fact all three are deeply intertwined. <em>What We Ache For</em> is a practical book allowing readers to embrace the urgency and necessity of their creativity, whatever their medium -- writing, painting, sculpture, dance, music, or film. As Oriah says, "Doing creative work allows us to follow the thread of what we ache for into a deeper life, offering us a way to cultivate a life of making love to the world."</p><p>Following Oriah through this journey in such chapters as "The Seduction of the Artist," "Learning to See," and "Risk and Sacrifice," <em>What We Ache For</em> challenges and inspires readers to fully embrace their artistic selves as a way of forging a path of spiritual unfolding.</p></p><p><p>Oriah is the author of the inspirational prose poem and international bestselling book <em>The Invitation</em> as well as the bestsellers <em>The Dance</em> and <em>The Call</em>. Her writing sets forth in detail how we can follow the thread of our heart's longing into a life of meaning and purpose. Her latest book, <em>What We Ache For: Creativity and the Unfolding of Your Soul</em>, explores creativity as a way of accessing and cultivating a spiritually rich life. Oriah is the mother of two grown sons. She lives with her husband, Jeff, several hours north of Toronto in a home surrounded by forest stillness.</p>"I am drawn to write not because I think the creative process will bring me happiness, but because when I write I am happy." So admits Oriah Mountain Dreamer, writer, artist, workshop and retreat leader. Sharing more than a handful of deeply personal experiences, she demonstrates the intrinsic connection between creativity, spirituality and sexuality, which she defines as "an awareness of and appreciation for our physical life and a material reality alive with sensual detail." While most of her examples discuss the process of writing, she carefully includes all forms of creativity&#x2014;from dance to music to physical art. A ready-made audience familiar with her bestselling titles (<i>The Invitation, The Dance </i>and<i> The Call</i>) will welcome her latest offering. New readers, artists or not, will find a variety of treasures within this volume: the suggested contemplations, warm-up or writing exercises or even just her personal struggles as a creator. Many may breathe a sigh of relief when given permission to end a thought mid-sentence if it's going nowhere; may not realize that they're stifling creativity if they're trying to create in the same place they pay their bills; may not admit that creative people must cultivate "necessary silence." Those looking to refresh their spirit, revive their creativity or merely get to know themselves better should spend some time with this book.<i> (May)</i></p><h2>The South Beach Diet Taste of Summer Cookbook</h2><p>What better way to enjoy the relaxed, healthy South Beach Diet lifestyle than with a cookbook that celebrates the best foods of summer from garden and market?

With the abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables available at this time of year, it's so easy to eat healthy. Whether you shop at a local farmers' market or supermarket or enjoy the bounty of your own garden, the foods of summer naturally suit the South Beach Diet.<br><br>Since we all like to relax during these warm months, preparing food should be laid-back and fun. The easy recipes in this book help you do just that, any night of the week, whether you're eating in or making food for a picnic, barbecue, camping trip, day at the beach, or ballgame. Imagine packing a cooler with South Beach Diet Club Sandwiches (page 51), a side of Savoy Slaw with Sesame Dressing (page 88), and fresh Summer Fruit Cocktail for dessert (page 212). Add some plastic utensils, a few napkins, and a bottle of water and you're good to go!<br><br>Burgers, hot dogs, fries, and creamy potato and egg salads are on everyone's list of summer favorites, including ours, so we've updated them-- creating healthy versions that are tastier than ever. Juicy Chimichurri Burgers (page 148) are made with lean ground beef, and there are Asian Tuna Burgers (page 116) and South-of-the-Border Salmon Burgers (page 117), too. We've lightened up potato salad with a creamy yogurt dressing (page 81), and egg salad by using more egg whites than yolks (page 47). Hot dogs are dressed with a homemade tomato and pickle relish (page 158) that's sugar free and much lower in sodium than supermarket versions. For vegetarians, there are tasty Chicago-style tofu dogs (page 181), charred on the grill and topped with hot peppers, ripe tomato slices, tangy mustard, and more. You'll make delicious grilled fries using fiber-rich sweet potatoes (page 86), and refreshing Peach-Raspberry Shakes (page 230) that taste as rich as those made with ice cream. And this is just the beginning!<br><br>Along with these best-loved American summer foods, there are recipes inspired by the cuisines of warm climes around the globe. You'll find Spanish White Gazpacho (page 43), made with protein-and fiber-rich almonds; Caribbean-style drinks (pages 223 and 228); Middle Eastern grilled meatballs (page 156); and Moroccan Couscous (page 77). On hot days, you might make Summer's Bounty Greek Salad (page 66) or enjoy a simple piece of spice-rubbed chicken or fish with a side of Spanish Rice Salad with Pumpkin Seeds (page 89). For cooler days and nights, try Quick Chicken Tagine (page 134) or Southern-Style Shrimp Boil (page 96).<br><br>No matter which recipe you choose, you'll find we've used healthy and easy cooking techniques, like grilling and quick sauteing, throughout the book. You won't be toiling over a hot stove or heating up the kitchen for hours with the oven on high. And with a little advance planning, you can maximize your time outdoors and with the family. Spend some time on Sunday thinking through the meals you'd like to make during the coming week. Refer to the sample meal plans on pages 234 to 249, which combine recipes from the book with other quick-to-put-together dishes for Phases 1 and 2. If you're making Grilled Chicken Fajitas (page 143), for instance, throw on some extra chicken to use in tomorrow's lunch of Curried Chicken Salad with Peanuts (page 136); use it instead of the sauteed chicken the recipe calls for. Or add a piece of salmon to the grill for a delicious next-day supper of Grilled Salmon and Farro Salad (page 105). By thinking ahead and doing some advance preparation, you can save valuable time to relax and enjoy more summer fun.<br><br>The Phases: A Short Course<br><br>Here are the fundamentals of the South Beach Diet's three phases:<br><br>Phase 1: This is the shortest phase of the diet, lasting only 2 weeks. Phase 1 is for people who have a substantial amount of weight to lose or who experience significant cravings for sugar and refined starches. During this phase, you'll jump-start your weight loss and stabilize your blood sugar levels to minimize cravings by eating a diet rich in healthy lean protein (fish, chicken, and lean cuts of beef), vegetables, nuts, reduced- fat cheeses, eggs, low-fat dairy, and good unsaturated fats, such as extra- virgin olive oil. You'll enjoy three satisfying meals a day, plus at least two snacks, and you'll even be able to have some desserts. What you won't be eating are starches (bread, pasta, and rice) or sugar (including fruit and fruit juices). While this may be hard at first, remember that in just 2 weeks you'll be adding many of these foods back into your life. Exercise during all phases is important to your overall health and will improve your results.<br><br>Phase 2: Those people who have 10 �ds or less to lose, who don't have problems with cravings, or who simply want to improve their health can start the diet with Phase 2. If you're moving on to Phase 2 from Phase 1, you'll find that your weight will continue to drop steadily and your cravings will have subsided. You'll gradually reintroduce many of the foods that were off-limits on Phase 1, including more good carbs such as whole- grain breads, whole-wheat pasta, and brown rice, as well as whole fruits and some root vegetables (such as sweet potatoes). You'll even be able to have a glass or two of red or white wine with meals if you like. Continue on Phase 2 until you reach a weight that's healthy for you.<br><br>Phase 3: This phase begins once you reach your healthy weight. At this point, you'll fully understand how to make good food choices while maintaining your health and weight. Since your South Beach Diet lifestyle will be second nature and you'll be able to monitor your body's response to particular foods with ease, you'll find yourself naturally making the right choices. Remember, once you reach Phase 3, no food is off-limits. You can even enjoy a few bites of a decadent dessert on occasion.<br><br>How to Use This Book<br><br>Whether you're on Phase 1 or Phase 2 or have made the South Beach Diet your lifestyle, this book will provide you with plenty of great recipes to cook all summer long. By utilizing the seemingly inexhaustible variety of fresh foods available, you'll have no trouble creating healthy meals whatever the occasion. But first, let's take a look at how this book is organized.<br><br>We've divided the book into nine chapters (from energizing breakfasts to cooling drinks), each filled with fresh, light recipes that take advantage of summer's most exciting flavors. To start the day, you'll find pancakes and French toast loaded with berries and other summer fruits, as well as some surprising egg dishes and more. You'll then move on to cooling soups and healthy sandwiches, bountiful salads and side dishes, and satisfying main courses for fish and poultry lovers, meat eaters, and vegetarians alike. And naturally, we've got delicious desserts and refreshing drinks for all phases of the diet. Keep in mind that if your garden or farmers' market is overflowing with juicy tomatoes or bright zucchini and yellow squash, or if the kids are clamoring for chicken or pasta, you can simply turn to the index (page 266) to find recipes organized by main ingredient and, of course, by phase.<br><br>Whatever phase of the diet you're on, you'll have a multitude of satisfying dishes to choose from. During Phase 1, for example, you might start your day with Summer Squash Scramble with Fresh Tomato (page 17), then enjoy some reduced-fat cheese and celery sticks for a midmorning snack. For lunch, try a bowl of Garden White Bean Soup (page 46) paired with some turkey breast slices and a green salad. In the afternoon, snack on hummus and bell pepper slices. Then, for dinner, choose Grilled Tuna with Provencal Anchovy Sauce (page 108) and a side of Grilled Asparagus with Lemon Aioli (page 76). Keep in mind that on Phase 1 you can always enjoy Phase 2 burgers and sandwiches--the seasonings and sauces are so tasty, you'll have no trouble skipping the bun and savoring the filling on its own. Of course, all healthy eaters can enjoy Phase 1 recipes.<br><br>With each recipe, we've also provided prep and cook times. When you're making several dishes for a meal, you can often prepare one while another is cooking. This will help reduce your time in the kitchen. For example, while you're marinating the lamb cubes for Spicy Lamb Kebabs with Cucumber- Mint Yogurt (page 169), you can prepare a side dish of Grilled Fennel with Mixed Olives (page 83) or toss together a simple salad. Remember, you can grill meats and fish for sandwiches a day or two ahead, mix drinks and make slaws in advance, and get a head start on baked goods, frozen desserts, and fruit salads.<br><br>Since many of the recipes are adaptable, you can alter them to fit what's freshest at the market. If the tuna looks fresher than the salmon, for example, try swapping one for the other. If the peaches look better than the nectarines, use them instead. And as summer wanes, you can often substitute fall and winter produce so that you can enjoy many of the recipes year-round. We've also provided a guide for preserving fresh summer fruits and vegetables for use in cooler months (see "Extending the South Beach Summer," page 10).<br><br>Summer Food Safety<br><br>Food safety should always be at the top of your mind, especially when outside temperatures soar. You can avoid many common food-related health problems by taking the following precautions: Wash your hands thoroughly with hot soapy water before, during, and after handling food. Soak fruits, vegetables, and greens for 2 minutes, then rinse well under running water to remove dirt and other contaminants. Thaw frozen meats in the microwave or the refrigerator, not at room temperature. When storing raw meats in the refrigerator, keep them well sealed and on the bottom shelf to prevent juices from dripping onto other foods. Keep cutting boards used for raw meat separate from those used for fruits and vegetables or cooked meats to avoid cross-contamination, and wash them thoroughly after each use. Pack food for travel, picnics, and barbecues in well-insulated coolers or insulated bags with plenty of ice. Instead of transporting coolers in the trunk, place them in the backseat of your air-conditioned car. When grilling or picnicking, choose a shaded spot for outdoor buffet foods and coolers and avoid letting prepared foods sit out for more than 1 hour in hot weather. See "Great Grilling on the South Beach Diet" (page 9) for more safety tips.<br><br>Healthy Eating All Summer Long<br><br>The recipes in this book have a few key things in common: They are diverse and delicious, for starters! And they're composed of slowly digested, nutrient-dense, fiber-rich foods like whole fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, as well as good fats, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. These types of foods help keep your blood sugar stable, and they promote satiety--the feeling of fullness that signals you are no longer hungry. This is important because eating foods that leave you feeling satisfied can help lead to weight loss success.<br><br>Eating the right foods can also improve your health in numerous other ways. Let's start with fruits and vegetables. You may have heard of something called the ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) scale, which measures the total antioxidant potency of foods. (Antioxidants are what protect you from free radicals, naturally occurring molecules that can damage cells and eventually cause disease if left unchecked.) Summer fruits that rank high on the ORAC scale include blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, plums, red grapes, and cherries. You'll enjoy them in such recipes as Grilled Pork and Plum Salad with Almond Gremolata (page 167) and Strawberry-Blueberry Crunch (page 209). In the vegetable category, the season's antioxidant all-stars include kale, garlic, spinach, yellow squash, broccoli, red bell peppers, and eggplant. Try these in Curried Summer Squash Soup (page 36), Southern-Style Greens (page 85), and other great recipes.<br><br>Like fruits and vegetables, whole grains and legumes also contain antioxidant-rich phytochemicals as well as good amounts of fiber. In this book, we use a wide variety of beans and grains, including farro and wheat berries, which may be new to you. We also use nuts and seeds (in moderation) because they provide high-quality plant protein and also good monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Some, like pistachios, almonds, sunflower seeds, pine nuts, and flaxseeds, are particularly high in plant sterols, which (along with other monounsaturated fats like olive oil and canola oil) can help reduce "bad" LDL cholesterol. And, of course, the book is full of recipes for omega-3-rich fish and shellfish and lean poultry and meat dishes. Vegetarians will also be pleased to find a good selection of recipes featuring tempeh, tofu, beans, and whole grains.<br><br>Making the Most of Summer's Herbs<br><br>Fantastic flavor enhancers for healthy summer dishes, herbs can be used in everything from soups and salads to sauces and even desserts! The tips below, on pages 11 and 12, and in the glossary, on pages 256 and 257, will guide you.<br><br>Substitute dried herbs for fresh, and vice versa.<br><br>Substitutions can be made in many of the recipes in this book using a simple 3 (fresh herb) to 1 (dried herb) ratio. For example, if a recipe calls for 1 tablespoon (3 teaspoons) fresh rosemary, use 1 teaspoon dried.<br><br>Purchase wisely.<br><br>When purchasing fresh herbs, look for bright leaves with few blemishes and a vibrant fresh scent.<br><br>Store fresh herbs to last.<br><br>Wrap fresh herbs loosely in barely dampened paper towels, place in a resealable plastic bag with the air pressed out (leaving a small opening), and keep in the refrigerator produce drawer for 3 to 5 days. You can also store fresh herbs like basil, parsley, and cilantro bouquet style. Place stems in a glass with a few inches of cool water. Keep bouquets on a countertop in a cool area, away from sunlight and heat.<br><br>Grow your own.<br><br>Always have fresh herbs at your fingertips (and reduce grocery bills!) by growing them in your garden or on a balcony, windowsill, or counter. Buy potted herbs at your local farmers' market or nursery, where you can also get specific growing tips.<br><br>Make fresh herb vinegars.<br><br>Clean fresh herbs and pat them dry. Place in a small plastic or glass container. Cover the herbs with cider vinegar, red or white wine vinegar, or rice wine vinegar. Seal and refrigerate for 2 weeks; strain and discard the herbs. Use herb vinegars in salads and marinades. If the herb flavor is too strong, add more vinegar to dilute.<br><br>Brew fresh herb teas.<br><br>Simmer 8 to 10 tablespoons (or more to taste) of a fresh herb such as peppermint, chamomile, lemon balm, or lemongrass in 4 cups water for 15 minutes. Strain and refrigerate for iced tea or serve hot. You can enhance herb teas by adding citrus peel or fennel seeds to the simmering water.</p><h2>Oxford Book of Wild Flowers</h2><p>SM QUARTO, Pictorial Cloth Green And White,1960, PP.232, FLOWERS ARRANGED BY COLOR FOR FIELD IDENTIFICATION, REQUIRES NO BOTANICAL BACKGROUND</p><p></p><h2>Paper: Paging Through History (Thorndike Non Fiction)</h2><p><p>Paper is one of the simplest and most essential pieces of human technology. For the past two millennia, the ability to produce it in ever more efficient ways has supported the proliferation of literacy, media, religion, education, commerce, and art; it has formed the foundation of civilizations, promoting revolutions and restoring stability. One has only to look at history s greatest press run, which produced 6.5 billion copies of Mao zhuxi yulu, Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung (Zedong) which doesn t include editions in 37 foreign languages and in braille to appreciate the range and influence of a single publication, in paper. Or take the fact that one of history s most revered artists, Leonardo da Vinci, left behind only 15 paintings but 4,000 works on paper. And though the colonies were at the time calling for a boycott of all British goods, the one exception they made speaks to the essentiality of the material; they penned the Declaration of Independence on British paper.</p><p>Now, amid discussion of going paperless and as speculation about the effects of a digitally dependent society grows rampant we ve come to a world-historic juncture. Thousands of years ago, Socrates and Plato warned that written language would be the end of true knowledge, replacing the need to excise memory and think through complex questions. Similar arguments were made about the switch from handwritten to printed books, and today about the role of computer technology. By tracing paper s evolution from antiquity to the present, with an emphasis on the contributions made in Asia and the Middle East, Mark Kurlansky challenges common assumptions about technology s influence, affirming that paper is here to stay. Paper will be the commodity history that guides us forward in the twenty-first century and illuminates our times."</p></p><p>Mark Kurlansky is the New York Times best-selling author of twenty-nine books and a former foreign correspondent for The International Herald Tribune, The Chicago Tribune, The Miami Herald, and The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Those whose image of Crockett was formed by the cultishly successful Disney treatment will find much that is familiar: the Indian fighter with Andrew Jackson, the congressmen from Tennessee and, finally, the Texas patriot who died defending the Alamo. But Levy (<i>Echoes on Rimrock: In Pursuit of the Chukar Partridge</i>) offers more (although not a lot more) in the way of background and complexity, and is willing to expose some of Crockett's deficiencies without making judgments: Crockett clearly indulged his wanderlust at the expense of his wife, a strong figure in her own right, and was, for a variety of reasons, an ineffective, bumbling politician. But despite his faults, readers will find Crockett likable and talented. In Levy's view, Crockett's abilities were expansive, and he opines that Crockett's bestselling 1834 autobiography "prefigures by some fifty years the literary genre of 'realism,' with nothing remotely like it" until Mark Twain's <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>. And Crockett's falling out with President Jackson over, in part, Jackson's brutal Indian Removal Act of 1830 is to the frontiersman's credit.

Only the songs of the Baka people when they gathered around their fires on the other side of the river could delight him more. As always, it felt good to return to the Dja region, and to the remote Bantu village of Somolomo.</p><p>Behind the hut, children were at play, whirling up the dust from the red earth, shrill voices prompting congregations of weaver birds to burst from the surrounding treetops.</p><p>He got to his feet and went toward the light that flooded in from the window, placing his elbows on the sill and beaming a smile at the girl&#x2019;s mother who stood by the hut opposite and was about to sever the head of the day&#x2019;s chicken.</p><p>It was the last time Louis would ever smile.</p><p>Some two hundred meters away a sinewy man and his escort appeared from the path by the palm grove, an ominous sign right from the start. He recognized Mbomo&#x2019;s muscular frame from Yaound�, but he had never seen the Caucasian with the chalk-white hair.</p><p>&#x201c;Why is Mbomo here and who&#x2019;s that with him?&#x201d; he called out to the girl&#x2019;s mother.</p><p>She gave a shrug. Tourists were not an unusual sight on the edge of the rain forest, so why should she be concerned? Four or five days&#x2019; trekking with the Baka in the dense chaos of the Dja jungle, wasn&#x2019;t that what it was all about? At least for a European with plenty of money?</p><p>But Louis sensed something more. He could tell by the gravity of the two men and the attitude between them. Something wasn&#x2019;t right. The white man was no tourist, and Mbomo had no business here in the district without first having informed Louis. After all, Louis was in charge of the Danish development project and Mbomo was merely an errand boy for the government officials in Yaound�. Such were the roles.</p><p>Were the two men up to something he wasn&#x2019;t to know about? The idea was by no means unlikely. Strange things went on all the time in the course of the project. Processes were slow, the flow of information had all but dried up, payments were continually delayed or else never transpired. Not exactly what he&#x2019;d been promised when they hired him for the job.</p><p>Louis shook his head. He was a Bantu himself, from the opposite corner of Cameroon, hundreds of kilometers northwest of the village here in the borderland close to Congo. Where he came from, a suspicious nature was something you were born with and perhaps the single most important reason Louis had devoted his life to working for the gentle Baka, the pygmy people of the Dja jungle, whose origins traced back to the time when the forests were virgin. People in whose language malicious words such as &#x201c;suspicion&#x201d; did not even exist.</p><p>For Louis, these amiable souls were a human oasis of good feeling in an otherwise loathsome world. The close relationships he had established with the Baka and their homeland were Louis&#x2019;s elixir and solace. And yet this suspicion of malice was now upon him.</p><p>Could he never be truly free of it?</p><p>He found Mbomo&#x2019;s 4x4 parked behind the third row of huts, its driver fast asleep behind the wheel in a sweat-drenched soccer jersey.</p><p>&#x201c;Is Mbomo looking for me, Silou?&#x201d; he asked the stocky black man, who stretched his limbs and struggled to get his bearings.</p><p>The man shook his head. Apparently he had no idea what Louis was talking about.</p><p>&#x201c;Who is the white man Mbomo has with him? Do you know him?&#x201d; Louis persisted.</p><p>The driver yawned. </p><p>&#x201c;Is he a Frenchman?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; came the reply, Silou shrugging his shoulders. &#x201c;He speaks some<br>French, but I think he is from the north.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;OK.&#x201d; Louis felt the unease in his stomach. &#x201c;Could he be a Dane?&#x201d; </p><p>The driver pointed an index finger at him.</p><p>Bingo!</p><p>That was it. And Louis didn&#x2019;t like it one bit.<br>When Louis wasn&#x2019;t fighting for the future of the Baka, he was fighting for the animals of the forest. Every village surrounding the Baka&#x2019;s jungle fostered young Bantus armed with rifles, and every day scores of mandrill and antelope fell prey to their bullets.</p><p>Though relations were tense between Louis and the poachers, he remained pragmatic enough not to turn down a lift through the bush on the back of one of their motorcycles. Three kilometers along narrow paths to the Baka village in just six minutes. Who could say no when time was of the essence?</p><p>Even as the mud-built huts appeared in front of them Louis knew what had happened, for only the smallest of the children and hungry dogs came running out to greet him.</p><p>Louis found the village chief lying flat out on a bed of palm leaves, a cloud of alcohol fumes lingering in the air above. Strewn on the ground around the semiconscious Mulungo were empty whisky bottles like the ones they thrust into your face on the other side of the river. There was no doubt the binge had gone on through the night and, judging by the silence that prevailed, it seemed equally plain that just about all the villagers had taken part.</p><p>He poked his head inside the overpopulated huts of mud and bowed palm branches, finding only a few adults capable of acknowledging his presence with a sluggish nod in his direction.</p><p>This is how they make the natives toe the line and keep their mouths shut, he thought. Just give them alcohol and drugs and they&#x2019;d be in the palm of your hand.</p><p>That was it exactly.</p><p>He went back to the musty hut and kicked the chief hard in the side, causing Mulungo&#x2019;s wiry body to give a start. A sheepish smile revealed a set of needle-sharp teeth, but Louis wasn&#x2019;t about to be appeased.</p><p>He gestured toward the litter of bottles.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you do for the money, Mulungo?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>The Baka chief lifted his head and gave a shrug. &#x201c;Reason&#x201d; was a concept not much used in the bush.</p><p>&#x201c;Mbomo gave you the money, didn&#x2019;t he? How much did he give you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Ten thousand francs!&#x201d; came the reply. Exact sums, especially of this order, were by contrast a matter in which the Baka took considerable interest.</p><p>Louis nodded. That bastard Mbomo. Why had he done it?</p><p>&#x201c;Ten thousand,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And how often does Mbomo do this?&#x201d; </p><p>Mulungo shrugged again. Time was a relative concept.</p><p>&#x201c;I see you people haven&#x2019;t planted the new crops as you were supposed to. Why not?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The money has not arrived, Louis. You know that, surely?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not arrived, Mulungo? I&#x2019;ve seen the transfer documents myself. The money was sent more than a month ago.&#x201d;</p><p>What had happened? This was the third time reality had failed to match up with the paperwork.</p><p>Louis raised his head. Beyond the sibilant song of the cicadas, an alien sound became audible. As far as he could make out, it was a small motorcycle.</p><p>Mbomo was already on his way, Louis would bet on it. Perhaps he came to offer a plausible explanation. Louis hoped so.</p><p>He looked around. Something was certainly not right here, to say the least, but that would soon change. For although Mbomo was a head taller than Louis and had arms as strong as a gorilla&#x2019;s, Louis was not afraid of him.</p><p>If the Baka were unable to answer his questions, the big man could do so himself: Why had he come? Where was the money? Why had they not begun to plant? And who was the white man Mbomo had been with?</p><p>That&#x2019;s what he wanted to know.</p><p>So he stood on the open ground in the middle of the village and waited as the cloud of dust that rose up above the steaming bush slowly approached.</p><p>Even before Mbomo dismounted, Louis would go to meet him, throw his arms wide and confront him. He would threaten him with brimstone and fire and exposure to the authorities. He would tell him to his face that if he had been embezzling funds intended to help secure the Baka&#x2019;s existence here in the forest, the next thing Mbomo would lay his itchy fingers on would be the bars of a cell in the Kondengui prison.</p><p>The mere mention of the place would frighten the wits out of anyone. </p><p>And then the cicadas&#x2019; song was drowned out by the noise of the small<br>engine.</p><p>As the motorcycle came out of the bush and entered the open ground, its tinny horn sounding, Louis noticed the heavy box on the Kawasaki&#x2019;s pannier rack, and then the village came alive. Sleepy heads popped out from door openings and the more alert of the men emerged as though the subdued sloshing that issued from the box were an omen from the gods of the coming of the deluge.</p><p>Mbomo first handed out whisky bags to the many outstretched hands, then stared threateningly at Louis.</p><p>Louis knew the score at once. The machete slung over Mbomo&#x2019;s shoulder was warning enough. If he didn&#x2019;t retreat, it would be used against him. And with the state the pygmies were in, he would be unable to count on their help.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s more where this comes from,&#x201d; Mbomo declared, dumping the rest of the alcohol bags from the box onto the ground and at the same moment turning to face Louis.</p><p>As Louis instinctively began to run he heard the excited cries of the Baka behind him. If Mbomo catches me I&#x2019;m done for, he thought, his eyes seeking out openings in the bush or tools the Baka might have left on the ground. Anything at all that might be used against the man who now pursued him.</p><p>Louis was lithe, much more agile than Mbomo, who had lived all his life in Douala and Yaound� and had not learned to be wary of the undergrowth&#x2019;s treacherous fabric of twisted roots, mounds, and hollows. For that reason he felt reassured as the sound of heavy footsteps behind him faded and the unfathomable network of tributary paths leading to the river opened out before him.</p><p>Now all he had to do was find one of the dugout canoes before Mbomo caught up with him. As soon as Louis crossed the river he would be safe. The people of Somolomo would protect him.</p><p>A pungent, damp smell wafted like a breeze through the green-brown bush, and an experienced guide such as Louis knew the signs. Another hundred meters and the river would be there, but the next second he was stumbling out into a swamp that sucked him down to his knees.</p><p>For a moment his arms flailed. If he didn&#x2019;t find a sturdy plant to grab hold of, the mud would swallow him up in no time. And if he was too slow to extract himself, Mbomo would be on top of him. Even now the sound of his tramping feet seemed too close for comfort.</p><p>He filled his lungs with air, pressed his mouth shut, and stretched his upper body as far as he could until his joints creaked. Thin branches came away in his hand, leaves fell into his wide-open eyes. It only took fifteen seconds for him to get a hold and pull himself up, but it was two seconds too many. There was a rustling in the undergrowth and then the sudden blow of the machete from behind, lodging itself deep into Louis&#x2019;s shoulder blade. The pain came swift and searing.</p><p>Instinctively Louis concentrated on remaining upright. And for that reason alone he was able to come free of the mire and get away, as Mbomo&#x2019;s curses sounded through the trees.</p><p>He too had fallen foul of the swamp.</p><p>Only when Louis reached the river did he become aware of the full intensity of the pain and feel how his shirt was clinging to his back.</p><p>Drained of all energy, he sank to his knees at the water&#x2019;s edge. And at that moment Louis Fon realized he was about to die.</p><p>As his body toppled forward and the fine gravel of the shore mingled with his hair, he managed to pull his phone from the side pocket of his pants and tap the Messages icon.</p><p>Every key press was accompanied by a frenzied beat of his heart as it pumped blood out of his body, and when the message was written and he tapped &#x201c;Send,&#x201d; he faintly registered that there was no signal.</p><p>The last thing Louis Fon sensed was the pounding of heavy footsteps on the ground next to him. And then, finally, the phone being prized from his hand.<br>Mbomo Ziem was satisfied. The lunging of the 4x4 over the potholes of the dark red track through the jungle toward the junction and the main road to Yaound� would soon cease and the man beside him had thankfully refrained from passing comment on events. Everything was as it should be. He had shoved Louis Fon&#x2019;s body into the river. The current and the crocodiles would take care of the rest.</p><p>All in all, things had gone well. The only person who could have posed a threat to their activities had been eliminated, and the future was once again bright.</p><p>Mission accomplished, as they said.</p><p>Mbomo looked down at the mobile phone he had snatched from the dying man&#x2019;s hand. A few francs spent on a new SIM card and his son&#x2019;s birthday present would be taken care of.</p><p>And as he pictured the gleeful smile on the boy&#x2019;s face, the display lit up in his hand to indicate the signal had returned.</p><p>Then a few seconds passed before a discreet little beep confirmed that a text message had been sent.<br></p><p><b>1<br><br>Autumn 2008<br><br></b></p><p><br>Ren� E. Eriksen had never been a cautious man. It was perhaps why he had gone from success to failure and back again in an endless chain of unpredictable events, which in the greater perspective nonetheless gave rise to a certain degree of satisfaction with his life. At the end of the day he put it all down to some kind of innate luck.</p><p>Yet in spite of this, Ren� was by nature a pensive soul. When faced by the big questions and confrontations of childhood, he had often sought refuge behind his mother&#x2019;s skirts. Accordingly, in adult life he instinctively made sure always to have a reasonably foolproof exit strategy on hand when casting himself into uncharted depths.</p><p>For that reason he had taken time to think things through when his good friend and former schoolmate Teis Snap, now managing director of Karreb�k Bank, had called him up that afternoon at his office in the ministry and put forward a proposal a man in Ren�&#x2019;s elevated public position under normal circumstances would have considered highly inappropriate.</p><p>The bank crises had yet to begin wreaking havoc, but these were days in which the greed of speculators and the irresponsibility of government financial policy were becoming plain to anyone who earned a living lending money.</p><p>That was why Teis Snap called.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid to say that Karreb�k Bank will go bust within two months unless we can get our hands on extra capital,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said.</p><p>&#x201c;What about my shares?&#x201d; Ren� blurted out with a frown, his heart already pounding at the thought of the first-class retirement under Mediterranean palms he had been promised now collapsing like a house of cards.</p><p>&#x201c;What can I say? If we don&#x2019;t come up with something drastic right away, we&#x2019;re going to lose everything we own. That&#x2019;s the reality of the matter, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; Snap replied.</p><p>The silence that ensued was a pause between friends. The kind of interlude that left no room for protest or more abstract comment.</p><p>Ren� allowed his head to drop for a moment and inhaled so deeply it hurt. So this was the situation, and swift action was imperative.

All around the world, everyone knows "Scotty" -- but far fewer know the true story of actor James Doohan, who has brought Starfleet's legendary "miracle worker" to life for three seasons on television and in seven major motion pictures. Here at last are all the colorful details of Doohan's life and times, including: <p> </p><li>How war hero Jimmy Doohan charged the beach at Normandy on D-Day, and how World War II left its mark on him forever.</li> <li>How Doohan landed the part of Scotty on the classic <i>Star Trek</i> television series, and how the character acquired an accent.</li> <li>Memories of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and all of the original crew of the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i>TM, and the feuds and friendships that formed among them.</li> <li>How Doohan made his peace with <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>� -- and brought Scotty back to television for one very special episode.</li> <li>The long and affectionate bond between Doohan and generations of Trek fans -- and how <i>Star Trek</i> brought true love into Doohan's life.</li> <p> <i>Beam Me Up, Scotty</i> is an entertaining and indispensable look at the unforgettable personality behind one of the twentieth century's most enduring icons.</p>This is clearly meant to supplement the already fairly extensive knowledge possessed by your average Trekkie: e.g., the book presumes you know who Majel Barrett is (Number 1/Nurse Chapel/Deanna Troi's mother/Gene Rodenberry's wife) and that you're up-to-date with earlier gossip about the crew dynamics, which allows Doohan to gloss over his feelings about William Shatner: "I have to admit, I just don't like the man. And, as has been well-documented elsewhere, he didn't exactly have a knack for generating good feelings about him." As evidenced by the above, the writing leaves something to be desired, but there are insights and trivia enough for the fan. Actually, the best part predates Star Dates, as Doohan recounts a youth defined mostly by his family's poverty and his father's alcoholism. In 1939, motivated, no doubt, by equal parts devotion to duty and desire for escape, Doohan joined the military, where he spent five years in training before seeing action on the beaches of Normandy. On returning, he trained at a theater in New York City, worked with Leslie Nielsen, Jackie Gleason, Tony Randall; got a few TV roles; and even had a run-in with the entertainment industry's red-baiters. Doohan's a basically sanguine guy, with real insights into the extremely sharp double edges of his fame. After Star Trek limped to the end of its third season, Doohan said he was "saddled with all the disadvantages of a popular series (namely, being locked into a particular characterization) and none of the advantages (namely, continued employment)." With the old crew now unlikely to appear in any subsequent movies, Doohan clearly hopes this will clear the decks for a new acting career, sans brogue. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cube Route (Xanth, No. 27)</h2><p><p>For nearly three decades, Piers Anthony's bestselling Xanth series has been delighting tens of thousands of fantasy fans around the world.

What a complicated route, from such a minor trigger. <br>She was out picking bubble gum from the bubble gum tree beyond the hay field when there was a swirl of smoke beside her. "What are you doing?" the smoke inquired. <br>Startled, Cube gazed at it. "Talking smoke?" <br>"That doesn't exactly answer my incertitude," the smoke said, forming a set of eyes. <br>"Your what?" <br>"Dubiousness, skepticism, suspicion, mistrust, uncertainty--" <br>"Question?" <br>"Whatever," the smoke agreed crossly. <br>"I don't see why I should answer you if I can't see you," Cube said. "Are you a refugee from the smoking section?" <br>The smoke formed a mouth. "Ha. Ha. Ha," it said. "Very funny. Not. Don't you recognize a lovely demoness when you see one?" <br>"A demon!" Cube sidled nervously away from the smoke. "I never did anything to you. Why are you harassing me?" <br>"Because that's what demons do." A head formed around the eyes and mouth, framed by smoky hair. "Demoness Metria, not at your ritual." <br>"Not at my what?" <br>"Observance, rite, liturgy, ceremony--" <br>"Service?" <br>"Whatever! So who are you?" <br>"I'm called Cube." <br>"Cube! What kind of a stupid name is that?" <br>"It's not my name." <br>The hair spread out and formed a question mark. "You just said it was." <br>"I said I was called that. I didn't say it was my name." <br>The smoky features swirled a moment, then coalesced back into the face, which was now pretty in a dusky way. "Score one for you, drab mortal. So what <i>is</i> your name?" <br>"Cue. But when other kids saw me, they nicknamed me Cube, because I'm just not with it. I tried to pry it off, but that nickname stuck fast." <br>"They do," Metria agreed. "That's part of the curse of being human. Now answer my first question and I'll give you something." <br>Cube decided that she should do that, before the demoness got angry and did her some harm. "I was just picking bubble gum for the boys." <br>"What use have you for boys?" the demoness asked. <br>"I like them. But they don't like me." <br>The smoke formed a vaguely human female body below the head. "Of course they don't! Look at you." <br>"No thanks. I know I'm not pretty." <br>"That's the understatement of the hour. You give plain a bad name. Whatever made you suppose that any boy anywhere would ever be interested in you?" <br>"Well, I do have a certain quality of character." <br>"Like what?" <br>"Gumption." <br>"What?" <br>"Initiative, courage, aggressiveness, resourcefulness, common sense--" <br>"Guts?" <br>"Whatever," Cube agreed, frowning. "I've got gumption galore, but that doesn't seem to be what boys want." <br>"Naturally not. Boys can see, not think. They don't much notice character." <br>"So I have learned. But I thought that maybe if I got them something nice, like fresh bubble gum, they might let me hang around, and maybe get to know me." <br>"Not without a better appearance. Look at this." A dusky hand extended toward her, holding something. "Use the mirror. It is my promised gift." <br>Cube took the mirror and held it up before her. But it did not show her homely face. It showed an unsightly posterior in a dull skirt. "It's not working." <br>"Yes it is. It's a rear-view mirror." <br>"Rear-view mirror?" <br>"It shows your rear, idiot." <br>"Ugh! That's worse than my face. Take it back." She pushed the mirror toward the demoness. <br>"Nuh-uh! That gift can only be given, not taken back." <br>"I don't regard it as a gift. I don't want it." <br>But the smoke was fading, and in half a moment it was gone. She was stuck with the mirror. <br>She set it on the ground and turned away. And found it back in her hand. She threw it at the trunk of the gum tree, but it returned to her hand before striking the tree. She tried to smash it against a stone, but it shied away. <br>"!!!!" she swore, absolutely disgusted. At age twenty she was old enough to use an ugly word if so motivated. The demoness had succeeded in making a dull day into a bad one. That must have been why D. Metria had bugged her in the first place: to get her to accept the mirror. <br>She looked at the next tree, which bore pretty colored gum drops. She was half tempted to eat some of those, but they would just make her teeth drop out of her gums. That would make it difficult to chew. <br>She jammed the mirror into a pocket and headed for home, disgruntled. Maybe she could find someone else to give it to, someone with a prettier rear than her own. <br>That reminded her of her condition. "I wish I were beautiful!" she exclaimed. "Then I could nab a good man and settle down and have a nice family. Or something." <br>The demoness reappeared. It seemed she hadn't gone far when she faded out. "Ha. Ha. Ha!" she laughed in a carefully measured cadence. <br>"What's so funny?" <br>"You think pulchritude would solve your dreary life?" <br>"What?" <br>"Beauty," the demoness said crossly. "Whatever." <br>"Do you have a problem with vocabulary?" <br>"However did you guess?" <br>"Sometimes I get lucky, if the subject isn't men." <br>"Answer the question." <br>"Yes, beauty would transform my existence. Pretty girls have great lives, even if they have no perceptible minds. Everybody knows that." <br>Metria's form firmed into sheer loveliness. "Like this?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>"Yes!" <br>"You're wrong." <br>"How would you know? You're a demoness. You can assume any form you wish. You can stun any village lout with your beauty." <br>At that point a village lout appeared, walking down the path toward the gum trees. Metria turned toward him, opened her blouse, and inhaled. The lout fell stunned, blindly smirking at the sky. "True. But who wants a lout?" <br>"You could do it to a good man too." <br>"Yes. I did. I'm married." <br>"So you see. That's what I want to do. Then I'd be happy." <br>"Maybe. Lovely women traditionally make poor choices in men." <br>"I wouldn't. I'd choose a good one to stun. Because I have as much character as I don't have body." Then reality crashed in on her. "But what's the use? I'll never be beautiful, so I'll never nab a man." <br>"If that's what you want, why don't you do something about it?" <br>"What <i>can</i> I do about it?" Cube demanded. "I am the way I am." <br>"You can go see the Good Magician Humfrey, dummy, and ask him how to get beautiful." <br>Cube stood still for a good three quarters of a moment. "I never thought of that!" <br>"That's why you're a dummy." <br>Cube realized that in time, without a whole lot of effort, she could get annoyed at the demoness. But it was a good idea. "I'll do it." <br>"Of course he'll charge you a year's service, or the equivalent." <br>"I know that," Cube said, annoyed. <br>"And his Answer will be confusing, so you won't properly understand it until it's too late." <br>"I know that too. But his answers are always true." <br>"Also obvious in retrospect, making you feel even more like a dummy." The demoness faded out again. <br>It was true. But what other choice did she have? If there was any barely possible, remotely conceivable, faintest shadow of an obscure hint of half a chance that she could become even marginally pretty if you liked that type, she had to try for it. What was gumption for, if not to do something brave and foolish? Thus was her decision made. <br>"Ha. Ha. Ha," the voice of the demoness came, with just a wisp of swirling smoke. <br>Cube frowned. She hadn't even voiced her decision, but the infernal demoness knew. Still, she felt buoyed, because now at last she was setting out to do something about her plight. Even if the Good Magician couldn't tell her how to become beautiful, she would know she had done her best. <br>And if, just maybe, somehow, there was a way--what a change that would make in her life! <br>"That's what yooo think," the singsong voice of the demoness came. <br>"Oh, go soak your face." <br>"If you insist." There was a sound of sloshing water. "Glub. Glub. Glub." <br>Cube had to smile. Metria was some character. <br>"Thank you." <br>Cube ignored her. The demoness had to be guessing at her thoughts. <br>"No, your smile gave you away." <br>Oh. <br>The demoness reappeared, evidently about to speak some other incidental mischief. Her feet touched the ground. <br>"Hay!" <br>Metria jumped and puffed into smoke. "Who called?" <br>Cube laughed. "You touched the hay field. It always gets your attention, the first time." <br>"Bother!" the demoness said crossly, and faded. Cube was glad to have seen her get fouled up, for once, instead of doing the fouling. <br>"At least you didn't land on the romants hill," Cube said to the space Metria had faded from. <br>Sure enough, there was a response. "What kind of hill?" <br>"Romants. When the ants bite you, you fall in love. I think there's a small love spring under the hill." <br>"That's novel." <br>"A romants novel?" Cube could take or leave puns, but this did seem to be a good occasion for one. <br>"I'm gone." And maybe this time she was. <br>So when should she make the trek to the Good Magician's castle? Well, there was no time like the present. It wasn't as if she had anything worth returning home for. She lived alone, without even hope of male company. <br>She headed for the nearest enchanted path. Those paths were always best for traveling, because dragons and other noxious beasts couldn't get on them, and they had regular rest stops with pie trees and shelter. In fact she had always wanted to travel, but never had a reason to do it. Now she had the best one: her future happiness. <br>Cube walked swiftly. She was a good walker, having muscles in her legs and stamina in her torso. Of course that was part of the problem; she had muscles instead of feminine curves. So she could out-walk any girl she knew, but of course they didn't need to walk. Men came walking to <i>them</i>. <br>Soon she was out of familiar territory, but she wasn't concerned. She could defend herself if she needed to. Which was another part of the problem: her talent was an ugly, aggressive one, befitting her character, when she would have preferred an appealing, feminine one. <br>She approached a huge mound. It looked like an ant hill, except that wate...</p><h2>The Face</h2><p>Acknowledged as &#x201c;America&#x2019;s most popular suspense novelist&#x201d;(<i>Rolling Stone</i> ) and as one of today&#x2019;s most celebrated and successful writers, Dean Koontz has earned the devotion of millions of readers around the world and the praise of critics everywhere for tales of character, mystery, and adventure that strike to the core of what it means to be human.

As a seemingly endless and ominous rain falls over southern California, Ethan will test the limits of perception and endurance in a world where the truth is as thin as celluloid and answers can be found only in the illusory intersection of shadow and light.<br><br>Enter a world of marvelous invention, enchantment, and implacable intent, populated by murderous actors and the walking dead, hit men and heroes, long-buried dreams and never-dying hope. <br><br>Here a magnificent mansion is presided over by a Scottish force of nature known as Mrs. McBee, before whom all men tremble. A mad French chef concocts feasts for the mighty and the malicious. Ming du Lac, spiritual adviser to the stars, has a direct line to the dead. An aptly named cop called Hazard will become Ethan&#x2019;s ally, an anarchist will sow discord and despair, and a young boy named Fric, imprisoned by celebrity and loneliness, will hear a voice telling him of the approach of something unimaginably evil. Traversing this extraordinary landscape, Ethan will face the secrets of his own tragic past and the unmistakable premonition of his impending violent death as he races against time to solve the macabre riddles of a modern-day beast.<br><br>A riveting tour de force of suspense, mystery, and miraculous revelation, The Face is that rare novel that entertains, provokes, and uplifts at the same time. It will make you laugh. It will give you chills. It will fill you with hope.</p><p>Ten-year-old Aelfric Manheim is home alone when he receives a call from a stranger with a simple and terrifying message, "There is trouble coming, young Fric...You're going to need a place to hide." Meanwhile, security chief for the Manheim estate, former detective Ethan Truman, is tailing a "deader than dead" body that got up and left the morgue when he vividly experiences his own death--twice. In <i>The Face</i>, Dean Koontz delivers yet another spellbinding and chilling novel, where real and imagined monsters walk the streets, ghosts travel through mirrors, and the devil makes house calls. Stalked by both real and supernatural evil, the bright and sensitive Fric, virtually orphaned by his A-list Hollywood parents, and the brave but disillusioned former detective Ethan Truman, himself suffering from the loss of his wife, must rely on their wits and each other to escape a dark and disturbing fate. <p> The supernatural lurks just beneath the surface of the "real" in Koontz's novels, and <i>The Face</i> is no exception. Ghosts, angels, demons, child predators and serial anarchists run rampant in Koontz's tale--the unsuspecting reader never knows what is real or imagined until the characters themselves know--creating a disorienting and frightening experience, and one that is vintage Koontz. Whether it be the real-life "agents of chaos" who roam the world creating mayhem and death or the phone lines that carry words of the dead to the living, this is Koontz at his most powerful and terrifying.</p><p> In <i>The Face</i>, Koontz has created a modern fable for adults, taking the bones from tales of old and breathing new life into the characters. Clearly written for adults, <i>The Face</i> nevertheless channels the wit and wisdom of Aesop as well as the violence and villainy of the Brothers Grimm. While Koontz's penchant for elaborately singsong descriptions can be grating, ultimately it lends this tale its folkloric quality, i.e. "The June-bug jitter, scarab click, tumblebug tap of the beetle-voiced rain spoke at the window, click-click-click." In this fable, the world is a menacing and threatening place for adults and children alike, and the na�ve and uninformed go trip-trapping through life with no notion of the trolls that lurk in the dark. The moral of this story is that, good or evil, you will get what is coming to you; it's up to you to succeed or fail for you alone decide your path punishment or redemption. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>&#x201c;Dean Koontz is not just a master of our darkest dreams, but also a literary juggler.&#x201d; <br>--<i>The Times</i> (London)<br><br>&#x201c;Dean Koontz almost occupies a genre of his own. He is a master at building suspense and holding the reader spellbound.&#x201d; <br>--<i>Richmond Times-Dispatch<br><br></i>&#x201c;Koontz has always had near-Dickensian powers of description, and an ability to yank us from one page to the next that few novelists can match.&#x201d; <br>--<i>Los Angeles Times<br><br></i>"Still the DEAN of suspense...a rewarding climax...you'll enjoy the ride."<br>--<i>People</i> Magazine<br><br>"Both terrifying and amusing, THE FACE is classic Dean Koontz--a blend of murder, mystery and wit...Koontz's dialogue is sharp, his characters multidimensional, and the plot is tight."<br>--<i>The New York Daily News</i><br><br>"A modern Swift...a master satirist."<br><i>--Entertainment Weekly</i></p><h2>Primalbranding: Create Zealots for Your Brand, Your Company, and Your Future</h2><p>Identifies seven components that can enable companies to brand effectively for greater market shares, citing the examples of such top companies as Starbucks, Apple, and Nike to reveal the commonalities of successful brands.</p><p>As a senior executive at the world's most creative advertising agencies, including TBWA, Ogilvy, Hal Riney &amp; Partners, and Lowe &amp; Partners in New York City, <b>Patrick Hanlon</b> has worked on such famous brands as Absolut, UPS, John Deere, H&amp;R Block, LEGO, General Motors, BellSouth, Pepsi International, Sears, and IBM. In August 2003, he founded Thinktopia and began sharing his proprietary new primal branding construct with marketers from Target, Starbucks, American Express, and elsewhere. It was immediately hailed as "a provocative new look at classic branding." Others simply cheer that primal branding is "not the same old branding B.S." After a decade of working on Madison Avenue, the author is now headquartered in Minneapolis, where he serves Fortune 500 clients across the country.Positing that "a brand is a belief system," Hanlon, founder and CEO of "primal branding" company Thinktopia, throws a reverse spin on the 12-step addiction recovery program to trumpet his 7 steps (called "key factors") to inspire consumer addiction. His formula has vaguely mythic qualities: successful brands, he argues, come with a creation story, a creed, rituals, icons, sacred words, non-believers and a leader who's overcome stiff opposition. The similarities to religion (Hanlon prefers "culture of belief") will pique the thoughtful reader, but Hanlon's recounting of familiar business success stories (UPS's story, Lou Gerstner's turnaround of IBM) seems at odds with a book blurbed as "not the same old branding B.S." Though much of the book is the simple recasting of age-old branding tenets (Hanlon's "creed" is interchangeable with "slogan"; "icon" with "logo"), Hanlon's energetic case for thinking differently about common practices makes for a rousing read.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Having recently escaped from the greedy and powerful Lord Kodoc, ruler of the mountaintop empire known as the Rooftop, the crew are sure they'll be safe on a faraway mountaintop called Port Oro. No sooner have they arrived in the strange new city, however, than they learn that Kodoc isn't even close to done with them. He still seeks a mysterious object known as the "Compass," a device that lies somewhere on the surface of the Earth, deep in the Fog. Legend says that the Compass can control the Fog-even make the Fog go away. With the Compass, Kodoc will have the power to determine the fate of his entire Empire, and he knows that Chess is the key to finding that power. The race is on for Chess, his crew, and their new friends on Port Oro to recover the Compass before it falls into the wrong hands. Chock-full of positive themes about loyalty and teamwork and packed with hilariously misinterpreted pop culture references, Ross's middle grade adventure series about a juvenile airship crew raised in a junkyard continues to shine. In this case, with deeper characterization, even more nonstop action, and much higher stakes, the sequel is even better than the original. Readers will find themselves alternately laughing out loud and biting their nails as they anxiously follow the adventures of Chess and his friends.

For thousands of years, from its origins in ancient Mesopotamia to its current status as a vast global industry, the history of wine has been directly related to major social, cultural, religious and economic changes. This fascinating and entertaining book takes a look at 100 bottles that mark a significant change in the evolution of wine and winemaking and captures the innovations and discoveries that have had the biggest impact on the history of `bottled poetry&#39;. From goatskin to the German Ratskeller casks and invention of the glass wine bottle, from the short onion-shaped bottles of the 1720s to the tall cylindrical bottles of the 1780s, why Bordeaux, Burgundy and Hoch have their own distinctive bottle shape to the distinctive Paul Masson carafe of the 1970s. Other stories cover the first cork-topped bottles to screw caps, bag-in-box, cans and cartons, early wine labels once glue was strong enough, the first wine labels to be produced by a vineyard (and not a merchant as previously) and commissioned artwork by the 20th century&#39;s most iconic artists for labels on high-end bottles; historically important and unique bottles: the oldest unopened, the most expensive sold at auction, the rarest; wines from the oldest vineyard in production, from the driest place on earth, from the highest and lowest vineyards and the most northern and southern. Oz Clarke also writes about the people who have influenced wine through the centuries, from the medieval Cistercian monks of Burgundy who first thought of place as an important aspect of wine&#39;s identity, through scientists like Pasteur and Peynaud who improved key technical aspects of winemaking, to 20th-century giants like Robert Mondavi and Robert Parker Jr. Oz also talks about famous vintages, from the 1727 Rudesheimer Apostelwein to the first Montana Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc in 1979 and today&#39;s cult wines from Bordeaux and California. Word Count - 55,000</p><p>Oz Clarke is one of the world's leading wine experts, known for his phenomenal palate, irreverent style, accurate predictions, and enthusiasm for life in general and wine in particular. He is the author of many award-winning books on wine, including Pocket Wine A-Z (now in its 23rd edition), Grapes &amp; Wines: A Comprehensive Guide to Varieties and Flavours (co-authored with Margaret Rand), Bordeaux: The Wines, The Vineyards, The Winemakers, the Wine Atlas and Let Me Tell You About Wine: A Beginner's Guide to Understanding and Enjoying Wine.</p><h2>The World&#39;s Last Mysteries</h2><p>Reports facts and the most recent theories concerning ancient civilizations, archaeological discoveries, unexplained catastrophes, and other mysteries from man&#39;s past, illustrating accounts with hundreds of photographs, paintings, and maps</p><p>Text: English</p><h2>Nearer, My God: An Autobiography of Faith</h2><p>His Roman-Catholic faith has been an enduring part of the life and personality of William Buckley, Jr. Now, for the first time since his ground breaking <i>God and the Man at Yale</i> he has written a book about faith--his own.<br><i>Nearer, My God, An Autobiography of Faith</i> is William Buckley's superbly written story of his life seen through his abiding love for the Catholic Church, a love instilled in him from childhood. He reminisces about his school days in England, his family, the affect the Lunn/Knox dialogue had on him, and examines many aspects of Catholicism and its theology, doctrine and liturgy and on the way discourses about Lourdes, the vernacular mass, the Church and the State, the Crucifixion, the priesthood, contraception as well as the many people who have assisted him on his life's journey. A remarkable, revealing book about one man and his faith.</p><p>In <i>Nearer, My God</i>, William F. Buckley Jr. turns away from the political concerns that form the crux of his reputation and offers a series of thoughtful meditations upon his Roman Catholic faith. Although the book is subtitled <i>An Autobiography of Faith</i>, only portions of it are strictly autobiographical. Other sections include ruminations on the controversies of the modern Church--such as the continued ban on birth control and the ordination of female priests--and an exegesis of <i>Difficulties</i>, a remarkable 1934 collaborative debate between a Catholic priest and an amateur theologian. ("The volume has slipped from regular use," Buckley writes, "and even from the memory of younger people, but it is not anachronized, though it takes on some questions that no longer vex the religiously curious.")<p> Buckley writes with consistent intelligence and precision; how, indeed, could it be otherwise? Even those who do not agree with him politically will be struck by the sensitivity of his spiritual inquiry, particularly in his elaboration of the distinction between contemporary Catholic practice and the enduring Catholic heritage. <i>Nearer, My God</i> serves as a splendid testimony to the maintenance of faith. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>William F. Buckley Jr. is the founder of National Review and was the host of what was television&#39;s longest-running program, Firing Line. He was recently awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

But then comes the <em>Ankh-Morpork Times</em>, struggling scribe William de Worde's upper-crust newsletter turned Discworld's first paper of record. </p><p>An ethical journalist, de Worde has a proclivity for investigating stories&#x2014;a nasty habit that soon creates powerful enemies eager to stop his presses. And what better way than to start the <em>Inquirer</em>, a titillating (well, what else would it be?) tabloid that conveniently interchanges what's real for what sells.</p><p>But de Worde's got an inside line on the hot story concerning Ankh-Morpork's leading patrician, Lord Vetinari. The facts say Vetinari is guilty. But as William de Worde learns, facts don't always tell the whole story. There's that pesky little thing called . . . <em>the truth</em>. </p></p><p><i>The Truth</i>, Pratchett's 25th Discworld novel, skewers the newspaper business. When printing comes to Ankh-Morpork, it "drag(s) the city kicking and screaming into the Century of the Fruitbat." Well, actually, out of the Century of the Fruitbat. As the Bursar remarks, if the era's almost over, it's high time they embraced its challenges.<p> William de Worde, well-meaning younger son of reactionary nobility, has been providing a monthly newsletter to the elite using engraving. Then he is struck (and seriously bruised) by the power of the press. The dwarves responsible convince William to expand his letter and the <i>Ankh-Morpork Times</i> is born. Soon William has a staff, including Sacharissa Cripslock, a genteel young lady with a knack for headline writing, and photographer Otto Chriek. Otto's vampirism causes difficulties: flash pictures cause him to crumble to dust and need reconstitution, and he must battle his desire for blood, particularly Sacharissa's. When Lord Vetinari is accused of attempted murder, the City Watch investigates the peculiar circumstances, but William wants to know what <i>really</i> happened. The odds for his survival drop as his questions multiply.</p><p> <i>The Truth</i> is satirical, British, and full of sly jokes. Although this cake doesn't rise quite as high as it did in previous volumes, even ordinary Pratchett is pretty darn good, and those who haven't read a Discworld novel before can start here and go on to that incredible backlist. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><p>Sir Terry Pratchett, OBE, was the author of more than 70 books, including the internationally bestselling Discworld series of novels.

Will you cancel my gambling debts?&#39; Arthur asked. &#39;Depends on your scheme,&#39; the other man replied. &#39;Who is the target? Your sister?&#39; Arthur&#39;s lips curled in scorn. &#39;Hardly. She&#39;s my brother&#39;s daughter---eighteen, beautiful, and heiress to a fortune all her own. And she is alone this summer with only a crazy old aunt as her guardian.&#39; The little girl from the first three books of the Elsie Dinsmore: A Life of Faith series is now a lovely young woman of eighteen. She is about to meet a most unusual relative, her wealthy Aunt Stanhope. But a familiar relative has his own diabolical plans--plans that will threaten Elsie&#39;s innocent spirit and her trust in the people who love her best. What secrets are hidden behind the handsome facade of a courtly stranger? Can Elsie&#39;s faith lead her to the truth before dreams are shattered? In Elsie&#39;s Stolen Heart, readers will meet several delightful, new characters and follow Elsie&#39;s struggles as she faces a perilous threat to her happiness. Adapted from the original 19th century novels written by Martha Finley, Elsie&#39;s Stolen Heart promises an adventure unlike any that devoted readers have encountered before.</p><p>For girls ages 10-14 ? About 100 years ago, a bright-eyed little girl named Elsie Dinsmore stole the hearts of parents and children around the world. In 28 novels published between 1868 and 1904, Elsie exemplified true biblical faith in the face of adversity--inspiring generations of girls and young women. Now Elsie&#39;s story comes to life again in a completely updated series adapted from the original novels. While faithful to Martha Finley&#39;s stories and characters, these adaptations also meet the needs and interests of contemporary young readers. We first meet Elsie when she is eight years old and living on her grandfather&#39;s plantation in the South. In succeeding novels, she grows up, finds love, marries and has her own children, and eventually becomes a grandmother. Throughout her life, Elsie faces each new challenge--from personal temptations to the tragedies of war and the loss of loved ones--with strength, courage, and trust in the love and guidance of her Heavenly Father. Zondervan is pleased to offer the first four volumes of this timeless series. Although set in a distant time and place, they are as lively, engaging, and relevant as the best of modern Christian juvenile fiction. The Elsie Dinsmore series promises to provide inspiration and encouragement to a new generation of girls.Mission City Press is a Christian publishing company dedicated to teaching kids to live a life of faith with passionate devotion to Jesus Christ.<br><br>Martha Finley (1828 - 1909) was a remarkable woman whose quiet Christian life has influenced many.

It advises where to start and how to get involved with the worldwide horticultural campaign to "save our seeds." The work of seed activist individuals and groups is highlighted with inspirational tips and tales, and there is insight into the practices of major seed companies and how this has affected seed diversity, as well as how "seed breeding" affects the future of plants.

Though world famous and revered by classical music lovers everywhere, he guarded himself and his thoughts as carefully as his talent. Fascinated, author and filmmaker Bruno Monsaingeon tried vainly for years to interview the enigmatic pianist. Richter eventually yielded, granting Monsaingeon hours of taped conversation, unlimited access to his diaries and notebooks, and, ultimately, his friendship. This book is the product of that friendship.</p><br><p> Richter reveals himself as a man and an artist. Unsentimentally and with his characteristic dry humor and intelligence, the musician describes his poignant childhood and spectacular career, including his tumultuous early days at the Moscow Conservatory and his triumphant 1960 tour of the United States. His laconic recounting of playing in the orchestra at Stalin's surreal, interminable state funeral is riveting. Most important for music lovers, Richter discusses his influences and views on musical interpretation. He describes his encounters with other great Russian performers and composers, including Prokoviev, Shostakovich, Oistrakh, and Gilels. Candid sections from his personal journals offer his sober and unguarded impressions of dozens of performances and recordings--both his own and those of other musicians.</p><br><p> This volume offers readers the sizable pleasure of lingering in the thoughts and words of one of the most important pianists of the twentieth century. Unlike many other star performers, Richter was also an intellectual who had interesting things to say, particularly about the musician's proper role as interpreter of the composer's art. This alone makes the book worth reading. Sviatoslav Richter belongs on the shelves of everyone with a classical music collection and will also appeal to lovers of autobiography and admirers of Russian musical culture.</p></p><p><p>"In these pages, we hear only Richter's distinctive voice, unpretentious, ironic, at times defensive, humorous, convincingly sincere, as brutally candid about his foibles, his performances, and his preferences as about the strengths and failings of his colleagues. A man of determined privacy who shunned interviews, he reveals himself almost inadvertently in his recollections. This book is indispensable to anyone interested in a magisterial artist like Richter. For the music lover and record collector, the appendices are extremely valuable."<b>--Beth Archer Brombert, author of <i>Eduard Manet: Rebel in a Frock Coat</i></b></p><b>Bruno Monsaingeon</b>, a writer and filmmaker living in Paris, has made documentary films about Glenn Gould, Yehudi Menuhin, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, David Oistrakh, and Viktoria Postnikova.

He changed the world of sports and went on to change the world itself. As Muhammad Ali, he would become the most recognized face on the planet. Ali was a transcendent athlete and entertainer, a heavyweight Fred Astaire, a rapper before rap was born. He was a mirror of his era, a dynamic figure in the racial and cultural battles of his time. This unforgettable story of his rise and self-creation, told by a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, places Ali in a heritage of great American originals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Cassius Clay grew up in the Jim Crow South and came of athletic age when boxers were at the mercy of the mob. From the start, Clay rebelled against everything and everyone who would keep him and his people down. He refused the old stereotypes and refused the glad hand of the mob. And, to the confusion and fury of white sportswriters, who were far more comfortable with the self-effacing Joe Louis, Clay came forward as a rebel, insistent on his political views, on his new religion, and, eventually, on a new name. His rebellion nearly cost him the chance to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>King of the World</b> features some of the pivotal figures of the 1960s--Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad, John F. Kennedy--and its pivotal events: the civil rights movement, political assassinations, the war in Vietnam. Muhammad Ali is a great hero and a beloved figure in American life. King of the World takes us back to the days when his life was a series of battles, inside the ring and out. A master storyteller at the height of his powers, David Remnick has written a book worthy of America's most dynamic modern hero.</p><p>You'd think there wouldn't be much left to say about a living icon like Muhammad Ali, yet David Remnick imbues <i>King of the World</i> with all the freshness and vitality this legendary fighter displayed in his prime. Beginning with the pre-Ali days of boxing and its two archetypes, Floyd Patterson (the <i>good</i> black heavyweight) and Sonny Liston (the <i>bad</i> black heavyweight), Remnick deftly sets the stage for the emergence of a heavyweight champion the likes of which the world had never seen: a three-dimensional, Technicolor showman, fighter and minister of Islam, a man who talked almost as well as he fought. But mostly Remnick's portrait is of a man who could not be confined to any existing stereotypes, inside the ring or out.<p> In extraordinary detail, Remnick depicts Ali as a creation of his own imagination as we follow the willful and mercurial young Cassius Clay from his boyhood and watch him hone and shape himself to a figure who would eventually command center stage in one of the most volatile decades in our history. To Remnick it seems clear that Ali's greatest accomplishment is to prove beyond a doubt that not only is it possible to challenge the implacable forces of the establishment (the <i>noir</i>-ish, gangster-ridden fight game and the ethos of a whole country) but, with the right combination of conviction and talent, to triumph over these forces. <i>--Fred Haefele</i></p>ds more than any previous book in bringing Ali into focus . . . as a starburst of energy, ego and ability whose like will never be seen again."--<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"Best Nonfiction Book of the Year"--<i>Time</i><br><br>"Penetrating . . . reveal[s] details that even close followers of [Ali] might not have known. . . .

He is a court-appointed custody evaluator and the author of articles on abuse that have appeared in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> and <i>The Journal of Contemporary Psychology</i>. A former codirector of Emerge, the nation's first program for abusive men, Bancroft now practices in Massachusetts, while also training various state and judicial agencies nationwide in dealing with domestic abuse situations.Bancroft draws on 16 years of counseling men who abuse women and as a custody evaluator and child-abuse investigator to offer sound advice to women who are abused by their partners and are concerned about the impact on their children. Without judging women in abusive situations, Bancroft emphasizes that they are in the best position to help their children heal after witnessing abuse. She begins by describing how children view abuse from verbal put-downs of their mother to physical abuse and how their conflict and confusion manifest in a range of symptoms from sleeping and eating disorders to underperformance in school. She ends each chapter with action guidelines for women called "What Can I Do?" Bancroft analyzes the pros and cons of deciding whether to stay with or leave an abusive partner and offers coping strategies that include teaching children to be open about their feelings and devising a "safety plan" of escape if necessary. She also offers advice on choosing therapists and support groups, and practical skills for rebuilding the family. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This was an England where history was still alive in ancient country houses, parish churches with their escutcheoned Gothic memorials and tombs, in market towns and market place and in a landscape that still offered 'scenes, situations, and prospects remarkable fro extent and beauty."<br><br>Moule is often compared to his distinguished 17th century predecessors, John Speed and Joan Bleau. <br><br>This new edition of 'Moule's Maps' combines 56 coloured maps with the original text taken from 'Barclays Complete and Universal English Dictionary' in which they appeared in the editions published between 1842 and 1852.</p><p></p><h2>Morgan&#39;s Run</h2><p>In a novel of sweeping narrative power unequaled since her own beloved worldwide bestseller The Thorn Birds, Colleen McCullough returns to Australia -- this time with the story of its birth. At the center of her new novel is Richard Morgan, son of a Bristol tavern-keeper, devoted husband and loving father, sober and hardworking craftsman. By the machinations of fate and the vagaries of the 18th-century English judicial system, he is consigned as a convict to the famous &#34;First Fleet,&#34; which set sail, bearing, as an experiment in penology, 582 male and 193 female felons sentenced to transportation, in May of 1787 for the continent that Captain Cook had discovered only a few years earlier. The word &#34;epic&#34; is overused, but no other word can do justice to one of the most grueling and significant voyages in human history or to the courage of the convicts whose sufferings were not ended but had only just begun when they set foot on Australian soil at Botany Bay on January 19th, 1788. Of those convicts, Richard Morgan stood out, not only for his strength and his calm determination to let no man bully him, but also for his intelligence, his fair-mindedness, his common sense, and his willingness to help others. To these qualities must be added a certain innate dignity that hinted, even in the most terrible conditions, at a life marked by tragedies that would have broken most men. In Richard Morgan, Colleen McCullough has created one of her most compelling characters. We see through Morgan&#39;s eyes the two worlds in which the story takes place: that of 18th-century Bristol, where Morgan was born and expected to live out his life, and that of a convicted felon sent to settle a hostile new world. When the book begins, Richard Morgan is a contented man -- happily married, with a child he adores. Then, piece by piece, his idyll crumbles until he finds himself led into an ambiguous relationship with a beautiful young woman, whose dissolute protector seeks vengeance on Morgan to protect his own skin. He endures the agonies of bereavement and financial loss, incarceration in prison and aboard the notorious &#34;hulks,&#34; then the horrors of the journeys to Botany Bay and Norfolk Island, where he finds against all odds a new love and a new life. Richard Morgan&#39;s story is true, but in making Morgan the central figure of her novel, Colleen McCullough has created a hero whom no reader will ever forget; she has written not only a great adventure and a powerful love story, but also a book that combines the elements of Tom Jones and Mutiny on the Bounty. Morgan&#39;s Run is great fiction, full of drama, passion, history, love, and hatred, full-blooded and totally engrossing, a stunning work that is at once rich entertainment -- and a revelation.</p><p>Take a long voyage deep into the 18th century with Colleen McCullough, a novelist for readers with a big appetite for historical slices of life. In <i>Morgan's Run</i>, her mild-mannered hero is a Bristol tavern owner's son with a God-given gift for crafting the Brown Bess flintlock musket. This is handy, because England plans to employ it to put down the mutinous American colonies. McCullough knows this firearm right down to the last flange and frizzen spring--how its .753-inch ball shatters bones and butchers bellies and how you have to work up a mouthful of spit, then bite the paper containing the powder to moisten and rupture it before firing. And like a master gunsmith, McCullough assembles all the elements necessary to give the novel flash and impact: rogues and heroes, salty dialect, period detail, vicious intrigue, comic relief, betrayal, and unexpected romance. <p> She also knows just how her master of the crafts of tavern-keeping and musket-making would fit into the vast mechanism of history as the American victory wrecks Britain's economy and forces the crown to send convicts elsewhere. Richard gets a job with a rum distillery, but his sharp-eyed efficiency undoes him: one day he finds "a number of pipes hidden among festoons of spider-web," one of which is diverting 800 gallons a week to dodge taxes, a hanging offense. He unwisely reports this, which lands him in a net of corruption. Soon he is sentenced to various convict ships anchored in England, and then to a slave ship bound for Botany Bay in the new penal colony, Australia. But save your pity! Richard rises to the terrible occasion. "Prison had given him a star to steer by, and his own will had swelled sails he did not even know he possessed." </p><p> Though McCullough doesn't quite reach the literary heights of Patrick O'Brian's <i>Master and Commander</i> or Robert Hughes's <i>The Fatal Shore</i>, she shares some of their virtues. <i>Morgan's Run</i> is a good old-fashioned adventure novel with the unflagging energy and raffish cast of an action movie. She considered calling it <i>Morgan's Dirty Dozen</i>, and it would have lived up to that title, too. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Colleen McCullough was born in Australia. A neuropathologist, she established the department of neurophysiology at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney before working as a researcher and teacher at Yale Medical School for ten years.

Harry's father dies of a stroke the following year, and in the winter of 1960 his mother marries again, this time choosing for a husband a Russian by the name of Viktor Shukshin. Like Mary's mother before him, Shukshin has fled the USSR, a supposed "dissident," which perhaps accounts for Mary's initial attraction to him in what will soon become an unmitigated mismatch.Winter of 1963: Harry's mother is murdered by Shukshin at Bonnyrig outside Edinburgh, where he drowns her under the ice of a frozen river. He alleges that, while skating, she crashed through a thin crust and was washed away; there was nothing he could do to save her; he is "distraught, almost out of [his] mind with grief and horror." Mary Keogh's body is never found; Shukshin inherits her isolated Bonnyrig house and the not inconsiderable monies left to her by her first husband.Within six months the infant Harry (now Harry "Keogh") has gone to live with an uncle and his wife at Harden on the northeast coast of England. The arrangement is more than satisfactory to Shukshin, who could never stand the child.Harry commences schooling with the roughneck children of the colliery village. A dreamy, introspective sort of child, he is a loner, develops few friendships (with fellow pupils, at any rate), and thus falls easy prey to bullying and the like. And as he grows towards his teens, so his daydreaming spirit, psychic insight, and instincts lead him into further conflict with his teachers. But he is not lacking in grit--on the contrary.Harry's problem is that he has inherited his maternal forebears' mediumistic talents, and that they are developed (and still developing) in him to an extraordinary degree. He has no requirement for "real" friends as such, because the many friends he <i>already has</i> are more than sufficient and willing to supply his needs. As to who these friends are: they are the myriad dead in their graves!Up against the school bully, Harry defeats him with the telepathic assistance of an <i>ex</i>-ex-army physical training instructor; a man who, before the fall from sea cliffs which killed him, was expert in many areas of self-defence. Punished with mathematical homework, Harry receives help from an ex-headmaster of the school; but in this he almost gives himself away. His current maths teacher is the son of Harry's coach, where he lies "at rest" in Harden Cemetery, and as such he very nearly recognises his father's hand in Harry's work.In 1969 Harry passes examinations to gain entry into a technical college at West Hartlepool a few miles down the coast, and in the course of the next five years until the end of his formal (and orthodox) education, does his best to tone down use of his talents and extraordinary skills in an attempt to prove himself a "normal, average student"--except in one field. Knowing that he will soon need to support himself, he has taken to writing; even by the time he finishes school he has seen several short pieces of fiction in print. His tutor isa man once moderately famous for his vivid short stories--who has been dead since 1947. But this is just the beginning; under a pseudonym and before he is nineteen, Harry has already written his first full-length novel, <i>Diary of a Seventeenth-Century Rake</i>. While falling short of the bestseller lists, still the book does very well. It is not so much a sensation for its storyline as for its amazing historical authenticity ... until one considers the qualifications of Harry's co-author and collaborator: namely, a seventeenth-century rake, shot dead by an outraged husband in 1672!Summer of 1976. In a few months Harry will be nineteen. He has his own unassuming top-floor flat in an old three-story house on the coast road out of Hartlepool towards Sunderland. Perhaps typically, the house stands opposite one of the town's oldest graveyards ... Harry is never short of friends to talk to. What's more, and now that his talent as a <i>Necroscope</i> has developed to its full, he can converse with exanimate persons even over great distances. He needs only to be introduced or to have spoken to one of the teeming dead, and thereafter can always seek him out again. With Harry, however, it's a matter of common decency that he physically go and see them: that is, to attend them at their grave sides. He does not believe in "shouting" at his friends.In their turn (and in return for his friendship) Harry's dead people love him. He is their pharos, the one shining light in their eternal darkness. He brings hope where none has ever before existed; he is their single window, their observatory on a world they had thought left behind and gone forever. For contrary to the beliefs of the living, death is not The End but a transition to incorporeality, immobility. The flesh may be weak and corruptible, but mind and will go on. Great artists, when they die, continue to visualise magnificent canvases, pictures they can never paint; architects plan fantastic, faultless, continent-spanning cities, which can never be built; scientists follow through the research they commenced in life but never had time to complete or perfect. Except that now, through Harry Keogh, they may contact one another and (perhaps more importantly) even obtain knowledge of thecorporeal world. And so, while they would never deliberately burden him, all the trials and tribulations of Harry's countless dead friends are his, and his troubles are theirs. And Harry does have troubles.At his flat in Hartlepool, when he is not working, Harry entertains his childhood sweetheart, Brenda, who will shortly fall pregnant and become his wife. But as his worldly scope widens, so a shadow from the past grows into an obsession. Harry dreams and daydreams of his poor murdered mother, and time and again in his darkest nightmares revisits the frozen river where she died before her time. Finally he resolves to take revenge on Viktor Shukshin, his stepfather.In this, as in all things, he has the blessing of the dead. Murder is a crime they cannot tolerate; knowing the darkness of death, anyone who deliberately takes life is an abhorrence to them!Winter of 1976 and Harry goes to see Shukshin, confronting him with evidence of his guilt. His stepfather is plainly dangerous, even deranged, and Harry suspects he'll now try to kill him, too. In January of '77 he gives him the opportunity. They skate on the river together, but when Shukshin moves in for the kill, Harry is prepared. His plan goes wrong, however; they <i>both</i> fall through the ice and emerge together by the riverbank. The Russian has the strength of a madman and will surely drown his stepson ... But no, for Harry's <i>mother</i> rises from her watery grave to drag Shukshin down!And Harry has discovered a new talent; or rather, he now knows how far the dead will go in order to protect him--knows that in fact they will rise from their graves for him!&nbsp;<br>Harry's talent has not gone unnoticed: a top-secret British intelligence organization, E-Branch ("E" for ESP), and its Soviet counterpart are both aware of his powers. He is no sooner approached to join the British organization than its head is killed, taken out by the Romanian spy and necromancer Boris Dragosani. A ghoul, Dragosani rips open the dead to steal their secrets right out of their blood and guts;by butchering the top man in E-Branch, he now knows all the secrets of the British espers.Harry vows to track him down and even the score, and the teeming dead offer their assistance. Of course they do, for even they are not safe from a man who violates corpses! What Harry and the dead don't know is that Dragosani has been infected with vampirism: he has the vampire egg of Thibor Ferenczy <i>inside</i> him, growing there, gradually changing him and taking control. More, Dragosani has murdered a colleague, Max Batu the Mongol, in order to steal the secret of his killing eye. He can now kill at a glance!Time is short and Harry must follow Dragosani back to the USSR--to Soviet E-Branch headquarters at the Chateau Bronnitsy, where the vampire is now Supremo--and there kill him. But how? Harry is no spy.A British precog (an agent with the ability to scan vague details of the future) has foreseen Harry's involvement not only with vampires but also in connection with the twisted figure-8 sigil of the M�bius strip. To get to Dragosani he must first understand the M�bius connection. Here at least Harry is on familiar ground; for August Ferdinand M�bius has been dead since 1868, and the dead will do anything for Harry Keogh.In Leipzig Harry visits M�bius's grave and discovers the long-expired mathematician and astronomer at work on his space-time equations. What he did in life he continues, undisturbed, to do in death; and in the course of a century he has reduced the physical universe to a set of mathematical symbols. He knows how to bend space-time and ride his M�bius strip out to the stars! Teleportation: an easy route into the Chateau Bronnitsy--or anywhere else, for that matter. Fine, but all Harry has is an intuitive grasp of maths--and he certainly doesn't have a hundred years! Still, he has to start somewhere.For days M�bius instructs Harry, until his pupil is sure that the answer lies right here, just an inch beyond his grasp. He only needs a spur, and ...The East German GREPO (Grenz Polizei) have their eyeon Harry. On the orders of Dragosani they try to arrest him in the Leipzig graveyard--and this is the spur he needs. Suddenly M�bius's equations are no longer meaningless figures and symbols: they are a doorway into the strange immaterial universe of the M�bius Continuum! Harry conjures a M�bius door and escapes from the GREPO trap; by trial and error he learns how to use this weird and until now entirely conjectural parallel universe; eventually he projects himself into the grounds of Soviet E-Branch HQ.Against the armoured might of the Chateau Bronnitsy, Harry's task seems nigh impossible: he needs allies. And he finds them. The chateau's grounds are waterlogged, peaty, white under the crisp snow of a Russian winter--but not frozen. And down in the peat, preserved through four centuries since a time when Moscow was sacked by a band of Crimean Tartars, the <i>remains</i> of that butchered band stir and begin to rise up!With his zombie army Harry advances into the chateau, destroys its defences, seeks out and kills Dragosani and his vampire tenant. In the fight he, too, is killed; his body dies; but in the last moment his mind, his will, transfers to the metaphysical M�bius Continuum.And riding the M�bius strip into future time, Harry's id is absorbed into the unformed infant mentality ... of his own son!I: Castle FerenczyTRANSYLVANIA, THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 1981 ...Still an hour short of midday, two peasant wives of Halmagiu village wended their way home along well-trodden forest tracks. Their baskets were full of small wild plums and the first ripe berries of the season, all with the dew still glistening on them. Some of the plums were still a little green ... all the better for the making of sharp, tangy brandy! Dark-robed, with coarse rioth headsquares framing their narrow faces, the women cheerfully embroidered tidbits of village gossip to suit their mood, their teeth flashing ivory in weathered leather as they laughed over especially juicy morsels.In the near distance, blue wood smoke drifted in almost perpendicular spirals from Halmagiu's chimneys; it formed a haze high over the early-autumn canopy of forest. But closer, in the trees themselves were other fires; cooking smells of spiced meats and herbal soups drifted on the still air; small silver bells jingled; a bough creaked where a wild-haired,dark-eyed, silent, staring child dangled from the rope of a makeshift swing.There were gaudy caravans gathered in a circle under the trees. Outside the circle: tethered ponies cropped the grass, and bright-coloured dresses swirled where bare-armed girls gathered firewood. Inside: black iron cooking pots suspended over licking flames issued puffs of mouth-watering steam; male Travellers tended their own duties or simply looked on, smoking their long, thin-stemmed pipes, as the encampment settled in. Travellers, yes. Wanderers: Gypsies! The <i>Szgany</i> had returned to the region of Halmagiu.The boy on the rope in the tree had spotted the two village women and now uttered a piercing whistle. All murmur and jingle and movement in the Gypsy encampment ceased upon the instant; dark eyes turned outwards in unison, staring with curiosity at the Romanian peasant women with their baskets. The Gypsy men in their leather jackets looked very strong, somehow fierce, but there was nothing of animosity in their eyes. They had their own codes, the Szgany, and knew which side their bread was greased. For five hundred years the people of Halmagiu had dealt with them fairly, bought their trinkets and knickknacks, and left them in peace. And so in their turn the Gypsies would work no deliberate harm against Halmagiu."Good morning, ladies." The Gypsy king (for so the leaders of these roving bands prided themselves, as little kings) stood up on the steps of his wagon and bowed to them. "Please tell our friends in the village we'll be knocking on their doors--pots and pans of the best quality, charms to keep away the night things, cards to read, and keen eyes that know the lie of a line in your palm. Bring out your knives for sharpening and your broken ax handles. All will be put to rights. Why, this year we've even a good pony or two, to replace the nags that pull your carts! We'll not be here long, so make the best of our bargains before we move on.""Good morning to you," the oldest of the pair at once answered, if in a breathless fashion. "And be sure I'll tellthem in the village." And in a hushed aside to her companion: "Stay close; move along with me; say nothing!"As they passed by one of the wagons, so this same older woman took a small jar of hazelnuts from her basket and a double handful of plums, placing them on the steps of the wagon as a gift. If the offering was seen, no one said anything, and in any case the activity in the camp had already resumed its normal pace as the women headed once more for home.But the younger one, who hadn't lived in Halmagiu very long, asked, "Why did you give the nuts and plums away? I've heard the Gypsies give nothing for nothing, do nothing for nothing, and far too often <i>take</i> something for nothing! Won't it encourage them, leaving gifts like that?""It does no harm to keep well in with the fey people," the other told her. "When you've lived here as long as I have, you'll know what I mean. And anyway, they're not here to steal or work mischief." She gave a small shudder. "Indeed, I fancy I know well enough why they're here.""Oh?" said her friend wonderingly."Oh, yes. It's the phase of the moon, a calling they've heard, an offering they'll make. They propitiate the earth, replenish the rich soil, appease ... their gods.""Their gods? Are they heathens, then ... ? What gods?""Call it Nature if you like!" the first one snapped. "But ask me no more. I'm a simple woman and don't wish to know. Nor should you wish to know. My grandmother's grandmother remembered a time when the Gypsies c...</p><h2>Flowers On Main (A Chesapeake Shores Novel)</h2><p><br><br>When her last two plays are dismal failures and her relationship with her temperamental mentor falls apart, writer Bree O'Brien abandons Chicago and the regional theater where she hoped to make a name for herself to return home. Opening Flowers on Main promises to bring her a new challenge and a new kind of fulfillment.<br><br>But not all is peaceful and serene in Chesapeake Shores, with her estranged mother on the scene and her ex-lover on the warpath. Jake Collins has plenty of reasons to want Bree out of his life, but none of those are a match for the one reason he wants her to stay: he's still in love with her.<br><br>Jake might be able to get past that old hurt if he knew Bree was home to stay, but is she? The only way to know for sure is to take a dangerous leap of faith.<br><br></p><p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.</p><br><br>Bree O'Brien sank her fingers into the rich, dark soil and lifted up a handful so she could breathe in the scent of it. This was real, not like the shallow world in which she'd been struggling to make a name for herself for the past six years. Gardening was something she understood. Plants could be coaxed along with water and fertilizer and loving attention in ways that a theater production could not. A vase of flowers, artfully arranged, had only to please the recipient, not an entire audience, each of them a critic in one way or another.<br><br>She'd been relieved when her sister Abby had called her about the opening of the Inn at Eagle Point, now owned by their sister Jess. It had given her the perfect excuse to flee Chicago, where her last play had been savaged by the critics and closed a mere week after it had opened. In six years she'd had one regional theater triumph and two box-office and critical disasters.<br><br>Some playwrights might be thrilled to have just one big success, even far, far off Broadway, but Bree had always wanted more. She'd expected to be up there with Neil Simon, Noel Coward... heck, even Arthur Miller. Of course, that had been after her first success, when she was way too full of herself. She'd thought herself capable of Simon's comedic timing, Coward's wit and Miller's complex dramatic skill. There'd even been a few critics who'd shared that opinion.<br><br>That had made it all the more humbling when the second play had received only lukewarm praise and a shortened one-month run. The third had been skewered by those very same critics who'd sung her praises earlier. Her first play was suddenly being called a fluke. More than one suggested she was washed up at the age of twenty-seven.<br><br>She'd been relieved that no one in the family had been in Chicago for the play's opening to witness her downfall or to see the reviews that had followed. She wouldn't have been able to bear watching them struggle to be supportive. It was awful enough that everyone at the theater had been a part of the most humiliating moment of her career. None of the actors had even been able to look her in the eye as the director&#x2014;her <em>lover, </em>for goodness' sake&#x2014;had read review after scathing review at the opening-night party before finally crumpling up the papers and tossing them in the trash.<br><br>One of these days, she supposed she'd muster up enough confidence to sit down in front of her computer and try again, but for now she was happy to be back in Chesapeake Shores, in familiar surroundings, with her family fussing over her just because they loved her and not because they knew her life was in shambles. She'd needed girl time with her sisters, a rousing game of tag football and nonstop teasing with her brother Connor and his buddies, and a chance to hug her nieces&#x2014;Abby's twin daughters.<br><br>She'd needed to be back home even more than she'd realized, back in her old room where the only writing she'd ever done was in her diary or stories and plays written for her own satisfaction and no one else's eyes.<br><br>What she'd also needed, but hadn't admitted to a soul, was distance between herself and acclaimed playwright and director Martin Demming, a mentor for a time, a lover even longer. Lately, though, the relationship hadn't been working. Maybe she was already raw and overly sensitive after those vicious reviews, but it seemed to her he'd taken an almost gloating satisfaction in her failure. She hadn't been prepared for that.<br><br>So, here she was, three weeks after the opening of Jess's inn, kneeling in her grandmother's garden, yanking out weeds and letting the warmth of the sun soak into her bare and protectively sunscreened shoulders. For the first time in months, the tension that knotted there had finally eased. She felt... She searched for the right word, then realized it was <em>content. </em>She felt content with herself, even with her life, despite the current upheaval. She couldn't recall the last time she'd felt that way.<br><br>Oblivious for now to all the warnings about sun damage and Marty's constant and annoying admonitions about ruining her pale-as-Irish-cream complexion, she turned her face up to the sun and felt it ease the headache that came whenever she thought about the life she'd left behind.<br><br>Even as the thought surfaced, her hands stilled and she gasped slightly. <em>Had </em>she left it behind? All of it? Chicago? The theater? The writing? Marty? Had she really left it forever? Could she uproot herself from the world that had meant everything just a few short months ago? Was that what she was doing here, on her knees in the dirt, days after she was supposed to return to the life she'd always dreamed of? Was she giving up? Hiding out? Or merely licking her wounds before going back into the battle zone once again?<br><br>And that's what it was, Bree realized, a battle zone, with way too many potential enemies&#x2014;the producer, the director, the actors, the critics and the public, all of whom had their own views on what her work was or ought to be. Some days everything came together in an amazing collaboration. At other times, it was a highly charged emotional war with all of her carefully crafted words, scenes and motivations picked apart by those who thought they knew best.<br><br>She sat back and heaved a sigh. Oh, how she wished she had an answer to any of those questions.<br><br>"You've pulled up three of my summer phlox," Gram said, a clucking note of disapproval in her voice as she interrupted Bree's dark thoughts. "Do you want to tell me what's on your mind before you ruin the perennial garden I've spent years cultivating?"<br><br>Bree looked from her grandmother&#x2014;hands on hips, petite and feisty in her straw gardening hat, sneakers and bright-pink cropped pants and matching blouse&#x2014;to the tall, dark purple phlox already wilting amid the weeds she'd tossed aside to her left. At the sight of the flowers, she groaned. "I got the roots. I'll put them back in the ground with some extra water and fertilizer. They'll be okay, Gram."<br><br>Gram gave her a penetrating look that suggested she knew exactly what was going on with Bree, but was waiting for her to bring up the subject.<br><br>"Can you say the same for yourself?" Gram asked. "Will you be okay?"<br><br>Bree deliberately looked away and turned her attention to replanting the phlox. "I have a lot on my mind," she murmured, afraid that she would confirm Gram's suspicions if she said more. Of everyone in the family, only her grandmother seemed to truly understand her, to see inside her heart even when Bree was silent. To her father and even to her outgoing siblings, she was mostly an enigma.<br><br>"Your distraction's plain enough," Gram agreed. "What you need is to share some of it, make the burden a wee bit lighter. If you don't want to tell me whatever's on your mind, go over to the inn and have lunch with Jess or call Abby. She'd be happy to take you to lunch in Baltimore, I'm sure. She can show off that new office of hers. You can have a nice heart-to-heart chat."<br><br>"Jess has her hands full. She doesn't have time to listen to me moan and groan. The same with Abby. Now that she and Trace are engaged and she's commuting to Baltimore practically every day, she has little enough time for herself and the twins without wasting it on me."<br><br>"Nonsense! Either one of them would make the time, because they're your sisters," Gram said impatiently. "With the O'Briens, family comes first. We stick together no matter what. Didn't I teach you that years ago?"<br><br>She'd certainly tried, Bree recalled. It had been a hard lesson to learn after their mother had taken off for New York, fed up with their father's endless round of business trips and his neglect of their family. Gram had been the glue that held the rest of them together. She'd been the one who'd tried to nudge them into making peace with Megan on her visits home, encouraged them to keep an open mind toward their mother. Not that any of them had. They were young and unforgiving, and the complexities of their parents' relationship had eluded them.<br><br>Lately, Bree had noticed that her father was making more of an effort to connect with all of them. Mick had shelved an entire project in California to be home for the opening of the inn, though he'd taken off again soon afterward. Even their mother had come back for Jess's big day, which had created its own problems, but Bree had to admit it had been nice to have everyone&#x2014;at least everyone except her brother Kevin around for a few days. Kevin's tour in Iraq had kept him from being home for the festivities.<br><br>Those few days had reminded Bree of the kind of family harmony they'd had years ago, before Mick's acclaim as an urban architect and developer had taken him all over the world. It was exactly that kind of camaraderie that Bree had needed most when she'd left Chicago.<br><br>She could have told any family member about what had happened, and they would have done anything necessary to try to bolster her spirits. She knew that. She also knew she wasn't quite ready for the pity none of them would be able to hide or the sound, pragmatic suggestions Mick or Abby might have offered.<br><br>It would be better, she thought, to suck it up, make her own decisions and then get on with her life, not wallow in self-pity or dump all of her problems on her sisters, Gram or anyone else. What she needed, as always, was the peace and quiet to find her own way.<br><br>"Maybe I'll call Jess or Abby later," Bree hedged eventually. "Why don't I go inside and fix us some lunch. We can eat out here or even on the beach." She was suddenly overcome by a wave of nostalgia. "Remember when you used to make picnics for us when we were kids? We'd spread a blanket on the sand and spend the whole afternoon along the shore."<br><br>Gram regarded her with amusement. "Do I need to remind you that you were the first one to complain about the sand getting in your food and the sun being too hot?"<br><br>Bree laughed. "I guess I'd forgotten that part. Okay, we can eat on the porch. There's no sand on the porch, and there <em>is </em>a lovely breeze."<br><br>"Actually, I can't today," Gram said, a note of apology in her voice. "I have a meeting at the church." She studied Bree worriedly, then added, "But I can cancel if you'd rather I stay here so we can talk some more."<br><br>Bree wasn't ready to bare her soul. "No, go. I'll be fine. Maybe I'll walk into town, do a little shopping and then have lunch at the caf�."<br><br>Gram nodded. "If you decide to do that, give my best to Sally and bring home one of those raspberry croissants of hers. I'll have it for breakfast tomorrow."<br><br>Bree feigned shock. "You're actually going to eat someone else's baking? Or are you trying to figure out her recipe so you can make them yourself?"<br><br>"When someone has a knack for something, I'm perfectly content to leave them to it. Sally's croissants melt in your mouth. Why try to improve on that?"<br><br>"I think I'll tell her you said that," Bree teased. "It'll please her to know that the greatest baker in Chesapeake Shores admires her croissants."<br><br>Gram drew herself up indignantly. "It's nothing I haven't told her myself, young lady. I'm not beyond giving credit where it's due. Now go along with you. Try to come back with a smile on your face. It troubles me to see you looking so lost."<br><br>Bree knew that Gram was attuned to her moods, but she hadn't expected her to hit on such an apt description. She was lost. Having one person who could read her and was always willing to lend an ear, offer advice or whatever else she needed brought unexpected tears to her eyes. If she wasn't careful, she'd start bawling right here and now, and Gram would stay put and pry the whole pitiful story out of her.<br><br>Instead, she forced a smile. "I'm just sorting through a few things. It's nothing for you to worry about."<br><br>The words were as much for herself as for her grandmother. It would be too easy to let herself wallow in that feeling of love and acceptance, to wrap herself in it and forget all about her dreams. Chesapeake Shores would be the perfect safe haven.<br><br>Then again, maybe it was time to take a really hard look at those dreams and see if they still fit, after all. Bree had the O'Brien streak of stubbornness in spades, but maybe there was no shame in letting go for once. Moving on. Making new dreams.<br><br>If only she had even a vague idea of what those new dreams might be.<br><br>Mick O'Brien stood on a street corner in New York City with his cell phone in hand, trying to work up the courage to make a call to a woman he'd known most of his adult life. Megan was his ex-wife, for heaven's sake! Dialing her number shouldn't be harder than facing down an entire planning and zoning commission dead set on vetoing one of his developments. Yet he'd done that numerous times without batting an eye, while just the prospect of making this call had his palms sweating.<br><br>Losing his nerve, Mick snapped the phone shut for the third time and turned on his heel. He wound up in a coffee shop somewhere on the Upper East Side of the city, just blocks from Megan's apartment, cursing his own cowardice or maybe the decision that had brought him to New York in the first place, after all these years.<br><br>Seeing Megan again at the opening of Jess's inn had unleashed something inside him. He'd suddenly remembered the way it had felt to love her, how he'd always felt ten feet tall when she'd looked at him. All the years of burning anger and resentment over their breakup had disappeared in the space of a heartbeat when he'd seen her walking toward him on the beach, her figure as lithe as a girl's, her auburn hair whipping in the wind.<br><br></p><h2>Day by Day with James Allen</h2><p>James Allen&#x2019;s classic <i><b>As A Man Thinketh</b></i> has inspired millions around the world since its introduction more than 100 years ago.

A very private man, Camus could be charming and prickly, sincere and theatrical, genuinely humble, yet full of great ambition.<br><br>Todd paints a vivid picture of the time and place that shaped Camus--his impoverished childhood in the Algerian city of Belcourt, the sea and the sun and the hot sands that he so loved (he would always feel an exile elsewhere), and the educational system that nurtured him. We see the forces that lured him into communism, and his attraction to the theater and to journalism as outlets for his creativity. <br><br>The Paris that Camus was inevitably drawn to is one that Todd knows intimately, and he brings alive the war years, the underground activities that Camus was caught up in during the Occupation and the bitter postwar period, as well as the intrigues of the French literati who embraced Camus after his first novel, <b>L'Etranger</b>, was published. Todd is also keenly attuned to the French intellectual climate, and as he takes Camus's measure as a successful novelist, journalist, playwright and director, literary editor, philosopher, he also reveals the temperament in the writer that increasingly isolated him and crippled his reputation in the years before his death and for a long time after. He shows us the solitary man behind the mask--debilitated by continuing bouts of tuberculosis, constantly drawn to irresistible women, and deeply troubled by his political conflicts with the reigning French intellectuals, particularly by the vitriol of his former friend Sartre over the Algerian conflict.<br><br>Filled with sharp observations and sparkling with telling details, here is a wonderfully human portrait of the Nobel Prize-winning writer, who died at the age of forty-six and who remains one of the most influential literary figures of our time.</p><p>Olivier Todd's biography of Albert Camus matches its subject's depth by portraying the man as well as the moralist. Born in Algeria and raised in poverty by an illiterate mother, Camus never forgot where he came from. He made his name in Nazi-occupied Paris--publicly as the author of <i>The Stranger</i> and <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>, covertly as a member of the Resistance and editor of its newspaper, <i>Combat</i>--but he longed for the North African sun of his youth. During the years of crisis when Algeria struggled to break free from France, Camus alienated both colonialists and revolutionaries by supporting full equality for Arabs but denouncing terrorism. "I believe in justice," he told an Algerian heckler at a 1957 meeting he addressed in Stockholm after winning the Nobel Prize. "But I will defend my mother before justice." It is this preference for the concrete over the abstract that makes Camus such an appealing thinker. Todd's biography, which offers the most fully human depiction yet, is equally engaging.Born in Paris in 1929, Olivier Todd studied at the Sorbonne and at Cambridge University.

Backed by her landmark scientific work on mindfulness and artistic nature, bestselling author and Harvard psychologist Ellen J. Langer shows us that creativity is not a rare gift that only some special few are born with, but rather an integral part of everyone&#x2019;s makeup. All of us can express our creative impulses&#x2013; authentically and uniquely&#x2013;and, in the process, enrich our lives.<br><br>Why then do so many of us merely dream of <i>someday</i> painting, someday writing, someday making music? Why do we think the same old thoughts, harbor the same old prejudices, stay stuck in the same old mud? Who taught us to think &#x201c;inside the box&#x201d;? <br><br>No one is more qualified to answer these questions than Dr. Langer, who has explored their every facet for years. She describes dozens of fascinating experiments&#x2013;her own and those of her colleagues&#x2013;that are designed to study mindfulness and its relation to human creativity, and she shares the profound implications of the results&#x2013;for our well-being, health, and happiness.<br><br>Langer reveals myriad insights, among them: We think we should already know what only firsthand experience can teach us. . . . In learning the ways that all roses are alike, we risk becoming blind to their differences. . . . If we are mindfully creative, the circumstances of the moment will tell us what to do. . . . Those of us who are less evaluatively inclined experience less guilt, less regret, less blame, and tend to like ourselves more. . . . Uncertainty gives us the freedom to discover meaning. . . . Finally, what we think we&#x2019;re sure of may not even exist.<br><br>With the skill of a gifted logician, Langer demonstrates exactly how we undervalue ourselves and undermine our creativity. By example, she persuades us to have faith in our creative works, not because someone else approves of them but because they&#x2019;re a true expression of ourselves. Her high-spirited, challenging book sparkles with wit and intelligence and inspires in us an infectious enthusiasm for our creations, our world, and ourselves. It can be of lifelong value to everyone who reads it.</p><p>ELLEN J. LANGER is the author of two bestselling books: <i>Mindfulness</i>, which has sold more than 150,000 copies in thirteen languages, and <i>The Power of Mindful Learning</i>. Langer is a professor of psychology at Harvard University. Dr. Langer is the recipient of, numerous awards and honors: a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest from the American Psychological Association, and the Award for Distinguished Contributions of Basic Science to the Application of Psychology.Chapter 1<br><br>A Life of Mindful Creativity<br><br>"What attracted me was less art itself than the artist&#x2019;s life and all that it meant for me: the idea of creativity and freedom of expression and action. I had been attracted to painting and drawing for a long time, but it was not an irresistible passion; what I wanted, at all costs, was to escape the monotony of life."<br>- Pierre Bonnard<br><br>All of us have had the experience of being totally engaged in something&#x2014;a movie, an afternoon of adventure, or a new love affair&#x2014;and, like Bonnard, we seek lives steeped in such experiences. Bonnard found creative engagement in painting and lived a rich life that many dream of and most consider the realm of only a few special, talented people. That belief, however, is wrong. Complete, creative engagement in all that we do is the natural response to our world; it need not be extraordinary at all. It is, in fact, the experience we have when we are at play. Whether it&#x2019;s at play or in a more serious pursuit, if we approach the opportunity at hand creatively, we will experience such engagement. In the best of all worlds, a life of total engagement would be the norm, although in reality too many of us don&#x2019;t see the opportunity before us. What&#x2019;s more, we seem to do everything possible to prevent it from happening.<br><br>Too much of the time, we are not seeing, hearing, tasting, or experiencing what would turn lives troubled by boredom and loneliness into lives that are rich and exciting. We unwittingly give up our potential for creative endeavor and in the process live sealed in unlived lives, where monotony is the rule rather than the exception. Creativity is not a blessing some special few are born with or receive from above. Our creative nature is an integral part of our daily lives, expressed through our culture, our language, and even our most mundane activities. &#x201c;Art,&#x201d; wrote the painter Robert Henri, &#x201c;when really understood is the province of every human being.&#x201d;<br><br>This book is about the roadblocks that stand in the way of our natural creativity. It is intended to be a guide to opening up to creative engagement on a daily basis in all that we do. Imagine being very hungry and wandering into a room with a table full of delicious food. If the room were empty of people, none of us would need any extra motivation. We would taste some of everything, eat what we liked, and enjoy the feast. But fill the room with people and we would face a host of concerns that would give us pause: how the others might judge us if we filled our plates; whether we shouldn&#x2019;t, given the circumstances, watch our weight instead of eating heartily; or whether to listen to the judgments of others about the merits of a particular dish. Faced with such socially induced concerns, we might well remain hungry. In the same way, there are socially constructed roadblocks that keep us from experiencing our creative selves. While some may argue that it is a good thing to learn to curb our appetite at times, I don&#x2019;t think any would argue that it is to our benefit to forgo the pleasure of our natural creativity.<br><br>Engaging our creativity more fully, giving it a form that holds some innate interest, ought be part of everyday life for each of us. How often have we neglected activities like art, music, writing, dance&#x2014;or a host of other creative endeavors&#x2014;as we pursue careers and families? We might regretfully add them to the list of things we&#x2019;ll get to later, but we think little about why we are doing so. Then one day we realize that now is yesterday&#x2019;s later. We typically regard such creative pursuits as &#x201c;leisure&#x201d; activities, and that word suggests they are rather unimportant. They may well, however, hold the key to the problem of finding meaning and fulfillment in the rest of our lives. Because we take them to be for our &#x201c;leisure,&#x201d; they need not carry the threat to our self-esteem that changes in other aspects of our lives do.<br><br>Unfortunately, our culture leads us to evaluate almost everything we do, even our works of art, music, literature, and every other creative product. We look at the end product and pass judgment on whether it is &#x201c;creative&#x201d; or not without regard for whether a mindfully engaged individual created it. We distinguish the product from the experience of creating it. For most of us, it is a terrifying prospect to imagine being judged in this way. If we could put aside our concern for others&#x2019; judgment of the product, however, creative engagement could transform our lives through whatever creative endeavors we might choose. We can learn to choose to engage creatively in any number of ways, simply by learning how to be mindful.<br><br>Mindfulness is an effortless, simple process that consists of drawing novel distinctions, that is, noticing new things. The more we notice, the more we become aware of how things change depending on the context and perspective from which they are viewed. Mindfulness requires, however, that we give up the fixed ways in which we&#x2019;ve learned to look at the world. Most of us confuse the stability of our mind-sets with the stability of the underlying phenomena, and we come to think that things are, will always be, and even need to be a particular way without recognizing how they may also vary. It isn&#x2019;t as though we need or want to be so rigid. We celebrate as creative those who show us how the commonplace may be made different. Many of the mind-sets that hold us back, that deny us our own mindful creativity, are culturally reinforced roadblocks.<br><br>Learning how to remove the roadblocks that keep us from a more creative life can bring benefits to the rest of our lives. We may be able to learn to be mindfully creative in all respects and at all times. If we would prosper from this mindfulness, why is the path to creative engagement so often blocked? As much as we&#x2019;d love to play the recorder or write poetry, it&#x2019;s easier and safer to put it off because we are afraid of making fools of ourselves. Of course, we know we shouldn&#x2019;t worry about what other people think, but we do. Or when we actually give writing or drawing a try, the trying turns out to be more terrifying still, and we too quickly put our creative activity aside. Something interferes with just enjoying painting or playing an instrument for the pleasure it brings us.<br><br>Most of us don&#x2019;t really understand what keeps us from doing things that we are otherwise drawn to. The answers to that question interest me, both as a psychologist and as an artist. What exactly are the obstacles that keep people from engaging in a more creative life? How do these obstacles prevent us from getting started and then from more fully enjoying creative pursuits? Can we learn to engage our creative interests on the terms we seek? What would be the benefits of doing so? I have studied exactly these questions in my scientific life, and I know there are answers that can help virtually anyone become creatively engaged. As an artist, I have seen for myself how a creative endeavor, done mindfully, can teach us to lead more rewarding lives in all respects.<br><br>Mindfulness, and its counterpart, mindlessness, are states of mind that I&#x2019;ve studied and written about for many years, and I know how potent a force mindfulness can be. As important, I know that people can learn to remake their ways of thinking to be more mindful. In my experience, each of us has the potential for a renaissance, an age defined by a creative, purposeful, and engaged life. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether the creative work we choose is painting, dance, fiction, poetry, or music. What matters is pursuing it mindfully. How do we get from beginning some new activity to a personal renaissance? Learning what things stand in the way of our comfortably engaging in some leisure activity, and how to break down these roadblocks as we experience them provides the practice we need to deal with our more familiar stresses and fears. Once examined through this new lens, many of our &#x201c;problems&#x201d; fall by the roadside. We can, it turns out, pursue art for art&#x2019;s sake and art for life&#x2019;s sake, and it matters little what that art is. Any creative activity can have a powerful effect on our lives if we pursue it mindfully and recognize the ways in which old familiar fears and habits can be set aside to make room for the personal renaissance we seek.<br><br>I also know from personal experience and scientific study that people can, through the pursuit of their creative interests, enjoy the many benefits of a mindful life. We need not be trapped by fixed mind-sets, we can learn to recategorize the world, to change the way in which we define and approach events and our impressions of them. We can gain an enhanced receptivity to new information and an openness to new points of view. A mindful life can also give us increased control over the context of our lives and a new appreciation of process over outcome.<br><br>It doesn&#x2019;t matter what we choose to do. For my personal renaissance I chose painting. Rather than study any particular school of art, such as Abstract Expressionism or Pop Art, or even define myself as self-taught (which itself turns out to be another school), I wanted to begin a new group or school: Untaught Art. It is a school unlike any other you may be familiar with. The defining characteristic of Untaught Art is the pursuit of creativity with attention to the process of engagement, rather than a search for the rules that define it. The nature of being schooled is that once we learn how to do something, too often we stop experimenting, learning, and having fun. We proceed mindlessly. The alternative I&#x2019;m proposing will soon become evident. Entering into something new, without rules to go by, doesn&#x2019;t come to us easily. We have been taught to believe that rules will make it easier for us to find ou...</p><h2>That Dark and Bloody River: Chronicles of the Ohio River Valley</h2><p>They came on foot and by horseback, in wagons and on rafts, singly and by the score, restless, adventurous, enterprising, relentless, seeking a foothold on the future. European immigrants and American colonists, settlers and speculators, soldiers and missionaries, fugitives from justice and from despair - pioneers all, in the great and inexorable westward expansion defined at its heart by the majestic flow of the Ohio River. This is their story, a chronicle of monumental dimension, of resounding drama and impact set during a pivotal era in our history: the birth and growth of a nation.<br>Drawing on a wealth of research, both scholarly and anecdotal - including letters, diaries, and journals of the era - Allan W. Eckert has delivered a landmark of historical authenticity, unprecedented in scope and detail.</p><p>A six-time Pulitzer Prize nominee,&nbsp;<b>Allan W. Eckert</b>&nbsp;is an Emmy Award&#x2013;winning scriptwriter and a Newbery Honor author of books for young readers. He is also the author of the popular six-volume historical series&nbsp;<i>Narratives of America</i>&nbsp;and the creator of&nbsp;<i>Tecumseh!</i>, an outdoor drama staged regularly in Chillicothe, Ohio, that has played to more than a million people over the past 20 years.The Ohio River, a principal route for pioneers pushing westward along its 981-mile course from Pennsylvania through Kentucky and Indiana to Illinois, was the scene of fierce battles among warring Indian tribes?Shawnee, Miami, Cherokee, Iroquois, etc.?and between Native Americans and white settlers. Tapping journals, letters, diaries and government memoranda from 1768 to 1799, and fleshing out his panoramic chronicle with reconstructed dialogue adapted from primary sources, historian-novelist Eckert has fashioned an epic narrative history of the struggle for dominance of the Ohio River Valley that makes compelling reading. The lives of notable pioneer families (Zanes, Bradys, Wetzels), incursions of traders, explorers, colonists, adventurers and the historic exploits of George Washington, Daniel Boone, George Rogers Clark and others intersect. A biographer of Shawnee chief Tecumseh (A Sorrow in Our Heart), Eckert emphasizes the sudden, overwhelming movement of whites into Native American lands and the Indians' initial restraint and tolerance, followed by furious raids, wars and expulsions.
